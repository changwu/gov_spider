    My dear Mr. Secretary:
I regret that I shall be absent from Washington when the Business Advisory Council meets on November 19th and therefore wish you would extend my greetings.
I feel that the work of the Council in the study and solution of problems which confront the Government and business has been beneficial. I am deeply appreciative of the service the members have performed, necessitating many trips to Washington at their own expense, in addition to the sacrifice of time from their own personal affairs. This attitude symbolizes the type of cooperation essential to a continuity of the progress we are making.
We shall, I hope, pass into the next period of our Administration by looking to a wise and a more equitable balancing of the inter-related segments composing our economic and social life. To that end, the Business Advisory Council can render definite service.
Economic and social betterment hinges upon a continuous study of social trends, such as are reflected in human thought and action.
Study and analysis of these trends are a vital preliminary to the adoption of plans and procedures best suited to meet modern conditions. At this time I suggest a study on the part of the Council of the problem of further absorption of workers by private industry, the problem of improving living conditions of low income groups through low-cost housing and slum clearance, and the problem of improving wages and working conditions of employees in industry.
With renewed assurance of my appreciation of your endeavors, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Daniel C. Roper,
Secretary of Commerce,
Washington, D.C.
