Governor Romney Has Always Supported The Bush Tax Cuts:
Governor Romney Called The President's Tax Relief A "Powerful" Economic Tool. "Like Rhode Island, Massachusetts is heavily Democratic; John Kerry of the Bay State will sweep both places in November. I asked Romney how it helps Massachusetts that Bush is president. 'It helps America to have George Bush as president, and Massachusetts is part of America – still,' he chuckled. He said Bush, using the 'powerful' tool of a tax cut, has worked hard to stimulate the economy." (Charles Bakst, "Mitt Romney To Have His Moment In The GOP Spotlight," The Providence Journal, 8/31/04)
At The Republican National Convention, Governor Romney Praised Fiscally Conservative Government That "Leaves More Money In The Hands Of The Taxpayers."

(Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Republican National Convention, New York City, NY, 9/1/04)
At A 2002 Fundraiser, President Bush Advocated Making The Tax Cuts Permanent Saying "I Know Romney Feels The Same Way." PRESIDENT BUSH: "They also need to make sure the tax cuts are permanent. Let me tell you my thoughts about tax relief. When your economy is kind of ooching along, it's important to let people have more of their own money. Here's the page out of the textbook that I believe is important. I know Romney feels the same way. If you let somebody keep more of their own money, they're likely to demand a good or a service. And when they demand a good or a service in this system, somebody is likely to produce that good or a service. And when somebody produces that good or a service, somebody is more likely to be able to find work." (President George W. Bush, Remarks At A Massachusetts Victory 2002 Reception, Boston, MA, 10/4/02)

(Mitt Romney, Remarks At A Massachusetts Victory 2002 Reception, Boston, MA, 10/4/02)
