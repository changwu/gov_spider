When the Failing @nytimes or Amazon @washingtonpost writes a story saying "unnamed sources said", or any such phrase where a person's name is not used, don't believe them. Most of these unnamed sources don't exist. They are made up to defame & disparage. They have no "source"...Retweets: 31928Favorites: 121112

....Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.Retweets: 29143Favorites: 139094

"The President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job. When they say the death toll isn't going to be as high as reported, they (the opposition) act like they're sad because it's lower. I think they are (Press Conferences) wonderful."

So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!Retweets: 953Favorites: 3197

The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn't have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs & Trade are losers for the U.S., but winners for other countries, including China. If we followed their standards, we'd have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!Retweets: 17187Favorites: 73928

Governor @GavinNewsom of California has been very nice & highly supportive about the great job we have done, working together, for California. That is the good news, but this is the bad. He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems, MSDNC etc. He is strong! Will he fold?Retweets: 17150Favorites: 80488
