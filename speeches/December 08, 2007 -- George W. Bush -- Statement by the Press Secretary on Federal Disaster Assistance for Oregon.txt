Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis in the counties of Clatsop, Columbia, Lincoln, Tillamook, and Yamhill for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Glen R. Sachtleben as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
