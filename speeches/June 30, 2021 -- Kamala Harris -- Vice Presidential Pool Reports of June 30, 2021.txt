VP pool report #1 — gathering/background for VP's remarks at Generation Equality Forum
Good morning on what's looking like an extremely hot Wednesday at the White House. Pool has been tested and is gathering ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris' virtual remarks during the "Official Opening Ceremony" at the Generation Equality Forum, scheduled to begin at 9:35am ET.
Harris will speak in the South Court Auditorium, and you can follow along live via the WH's stream:https://youtu.be/9jvAuKfWKN8
Pool will send along any relevant color once we're in the room.
Passing along from VP's office:
ON BACKGROUNDToday at 9:35 AM, Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the U.S. Delegation to the Generation Equality Forum in Paris and provide virtual, live opening remarks. Her remarks will be livestreamed on WhiteHouse.gov/Live.
During her remarks, the Vice President will restate the United States' commitment to gender equality. She will also make the case about how gender equality is tied to democracy. She believes democracies are strongest when everyone participates, and suffer when people are left out. The Vice President will urge world leaders to fight for gender equality, which will create more economic opportunities and lift communities around the world.
The GEF provides an opportunity for governments, multilateral organizations, and civil society to make concrete commitments, mobilize resources, and generate political will toward achieving the vision of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Sustainable Development Goals, and broader gender equality objectives during the UN's Decade of Action (2020-2030).
Following the Vice President's remarks, the Administration will announce several robust deliverables associated with our participation in the GEF in three areas: gender-based violence, economic justice, and sexual and reproductive health and rights.

Additional Background:

The Vice President has addressed issues of gender equality on the global stage, delivering remarks to the European Parliament and the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. Her remarks to the Commission were the first time in history that a Vice President—or a President, for that matter—led our delegation to this Commission.
This is the Vice President's third engagement with the United Nations since Inauguration. In addition to speaking to the UN Commission on the Status of Women, she delivered remarks to the United Nations Dialogue on Pandemic Preparedness and Response, where she urged world leaders to prepare for the next pandemic.

Excepts AS PREPARED for delivery […]Around the world, democracy is in peril.[…]As we witnessed at the G-7 Summit just weeks ago, world leaders are uniting against the threat of autocracy.World leaders are uniting behind the principles of democracy.I believe, resolutely, that if we want to strengthen democracy, we must fight for gender equality.[…]Because here is the truth: Democracy is strongest when everyone participates—and it is weaker when people are left out.[…]So, I know, without doubt: Gender equality strengthens democracy.[…]

BRIEF HIGHLIGHTS
"Who gets hurt when democracies fall, when democracies falter? … Women and girls"
"As we move forward, I believe that if we want to strengthen democracy, we must fight for gender equality. Democracy is strongest when everyone participates and it is weaker when people are left out. We have seen this in the United States"
"I know without doubt that gender equality strengthens democracy"
To the young leaders attending the forum: "I remain hopeful and optimistic… remember to use the tools of democracy, whether that is the freedom of speech or the freedom to vote. And if you do not yet have those freedoms, fight for them and we will fight with you."
"Do not forget the power of your own story."
Pool is preparing to head back to the briefing room. That's all from me, y'all. Enjoy the rest of this scorcher.
