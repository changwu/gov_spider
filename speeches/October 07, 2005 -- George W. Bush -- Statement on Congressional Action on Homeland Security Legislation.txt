    I applaud the Congress for its work on the homeland security legislation. The resources provided by this bill will help us protect our borders, upgrade explosives detection technology in our airports, address radiological and nuclear threats, and target security funding to areas with the greatest need. The legislation will help make our homeland more secure.
