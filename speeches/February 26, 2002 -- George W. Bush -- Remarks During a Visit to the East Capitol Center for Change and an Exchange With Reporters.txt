The President. ——with healers, people of great and deep faith, who have come from some of the toughest circumstances known, to be leaders in their communities; people—one-time crack addicts, a heroin user, both of whom now are a good mom and dad; people who are helping others to learn that there's a better way.
And I just want to thank you all for sharing with me your experiences and your thoughts. You know, my dream for the country is that the welfare system work side by side with the faith-based programs, which can do a heck of a good job about changing people's hearts and their souls and, therefore, their minds and, therefore, their behavior. And you're living proof of what I'm talking about.
So I want to thank you for sharing your testimony with us. It only strengthens my resolve to make a good law that will propel the healers of America forward. And it only strengthens my knowledge about where the true strength of the country is, and it's in the hearts and souls of our citizens.
Thank you for your time, Curtis. Thank you for your leadership. I appreciate you inviting us to your program. I look forward to sharing some thoughts about some legislation.
