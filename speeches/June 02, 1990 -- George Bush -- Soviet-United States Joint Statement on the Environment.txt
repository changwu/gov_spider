    During the state visit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President of the USSR, at the invitation of George Bush, President of the United States, the two sides affirmed their serious concern about the health of the global environment, and their commitment to expand U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the field of environmental protection and the study of global change. Mindful of their obligations under international environmental conventions, and committed to continued international discussion aimed at other understandings on matters of common concern, the sides emphasized the need for practical and effective joint measures on environmental protection.
The United States and the USSR attached great importance to full and open exchange of environmental data, and to careful coordination of existing global atmospheric, terrestrial and ocean monitoring systems. Accordingly, they endorsed intensified bilateral cooperation in areas of environmental, ecological and pollution monitoring, and in related research.
The United States and the Soviet Union noted with satisfaction their agreement to establish, by the end of 1991, a Beringian International Park in the region of the Bering Strait. On other bilateral matters, they also pledged to facilitate contacts and cooperation between their respective non-governmental environmental organizations.
