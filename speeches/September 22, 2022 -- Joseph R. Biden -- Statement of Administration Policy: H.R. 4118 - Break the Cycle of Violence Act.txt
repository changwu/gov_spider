    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Steven Horsford, D-NV, and 95 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 4118, the Break the Cycle of Violence Act.
This Nation is facing an epidemic of gun violence. This violence robs us of loved ones and causes life-altering physical injuries. It causes lasting trauma, with cascading consequences for children, families, and communities. It steals our freedom, our sense of belonging and security, and has ripple effects for our economy. Black and Brown Americans are disproportionately harmed by the direct and indirect consequences of gun violence.
The Break the Cycle of Violence Act would authorize the investment of $5 billion in local governments and community-based, nonprofit organizations to establish or expand community outreach programs, hospital-based violence intervention programs, and other strategies, including focused deterrence, that provide tailored social services and supports to people at the highest risk of being impacted by community violence. The bill would also establish a $1.5 billion grant program to provide job training and work experience for youth in communities disproportionately affected by violence.
The Administration calls for swift passage of this life-saving legislation.
