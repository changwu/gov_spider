    There were plenty of winners in today's AFL-CIO election. The working men and women of the labor movement benefit the most. If every American got to choose in every election between candidates such as these, this country would be a better place.
I offer my hearty congratulations to John Sweeney, who has led one of the most progressive, growing, and innovative unions in America. He has been a force for inclusion and activism and has already left a deep and positive imprint on the labor movement.
The outgoing president, Tom Donahue, has been a source of strength and leadership in the labor movement for decades. Working men and women are fortunate for his many years of service, his integrity, and his dedication.
The theme of AFL-CIO convention was "Stand Up for America's Working Families." My administration stands with John and the other newly elected officers as we work together in the months and years ahead on issues important to America's working families.
