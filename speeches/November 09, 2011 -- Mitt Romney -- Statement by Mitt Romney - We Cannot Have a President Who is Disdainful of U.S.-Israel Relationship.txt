    Mitt Romney today issued the following statement on President Obama's comments about Israel's Prime Minister:
"President Obama's derisive remarks about Israel's Prime Minister confirm what any observer would have gleaned from his public statements and actions toward our longstanding ally, Israel. At a moment when the Jewish state is isolated and under threat, we cannot have an American president who is disdainful of our special relationship with Israel. We have here yet another reason why we need new leadership in the White House."
