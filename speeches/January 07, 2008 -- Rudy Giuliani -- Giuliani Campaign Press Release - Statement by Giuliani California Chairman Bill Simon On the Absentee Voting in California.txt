    Rudy Giuliani's California Chairman Bill Simon made the following statement today regarding the start of absentee voting in California:
"For the first time in years, California Republicans will play a pivotal role in determining who the Presidential nominee will be for their party. The voters in California begin to be heard today, as absentee voting starts in the state. As Republicans cast their ballots, I urge voters to choose the only true fiscal conservative in the race and the man whose tested leadership brought the country together in a time of crisis â€“ Mayor Rudy Giuliani."
