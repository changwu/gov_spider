    Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with the level of military activity in Somalia, or do we need to add the Marines that are heading that way?
The President. Well, let me just say that for now I think I should say that I've been fully briefed on what has happened to date. I'm encouraged, and I may have more to say about it this evening.
