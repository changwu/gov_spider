    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
As required in section 403 of the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act, I am hereby certifying that the Army is capable of providing sufficient forces (excluding forces engaged in peacekeeping operations and other operations other than war) to carry out two major regional conflicts nearly simultaneously, in accordance with the National Military Strategy.
Moreover, the attached report specifies the active Army units anticipated to deploy within the first 75 days in response to a major regional conflict that are currently engaged in peacekeeping operations and other operations other than war. The report also specifies my estimate of the time required to redeploy and retrain those forces.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
