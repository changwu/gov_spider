    As the scandal deepens around Joe Biden's lies to the American people about never discussing his son Hunter's foreign business deals, President Trump's re-election campaign today launched a new ad asking why Joe Biden never stopped his son from selling access to his powerful father. The ad details Hunter's $83,000-per-month position with a Ukrainian energy company, his $1.5 billion business deal with a communist Chinese bank, and his legal work with a corrupt businessman in Romania, all while his father was Vice President of the United States.
