    I commend the House Ways and Means Committee for passing legislation today that includes key elements of my Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. This clears the way for consideration by the full House of Representatives. This legislation will stimulate more charitable giving and support faith-based and community organizations in their efforts to help those in need. I will continue to work on a bipartisan basis with Members of the House and the Senate to implement my Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.
