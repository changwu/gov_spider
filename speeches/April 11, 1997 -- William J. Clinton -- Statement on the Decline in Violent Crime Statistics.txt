    Today the Department of Justice reported that violent crime dropped 12.4 percent in 1995.
Four years ago, we made a commitment totake our streets back from crime and violence. We had a comprehensive plan: to put 100,000 new community police officers on the street and tough new penalties on the books; to steer young people away from crime, gangs, and drugs; and to keep guns out of the hands of criminals with the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill.
Today we learned that the first full year of our crime bill produced the largest drop in violent crime in 22 years. Earlier this year we learned that the Brady bill has already stopped 186,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from purchasing handguns.
Our plan is working. Now we must press forward. Fighting the scourge of juvenile crime and violence is my top law enforcement priority for the next 4 years. In February I submitted my Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy to Congress. This bill declares war on gangs, with new prosecutors and tougher penalties; extends the Brady bill so violent teenage criminals will never have the right to purchase a handgun; and provides resources to keep schools open late, on weekends, and in the summer, so young people have something to say yes to.
I am hopeful that Congress will pass it without delay. We must keep the crime rate coming down and every child's prospect of a bright future going up.
