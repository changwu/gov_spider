    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, John Edwards released the following statement in response to comments made by talk show host Bill O'Reilly. On his show Tuesday night, O'Reilly expressed skepticism about Edwards' statement that 200,000 veterans go to sleep homeless each night. Edwards' statement is supported by a November 2007 report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
"Tonight, 200,000 brave veterans will be homeless, and they will sleep in shelters, on the streets, under bridges, and on grates – and Bill O'Reilly doesn't think there is a problem. For someone who spends a lot of time shouting about patriotism, you would think he would be outraged by the treatment of our homeless veterans. How many more will it take before we wake up and solve this crisis?
"These are the facts. Today, one out of four of our nation's homeless are veterans, and a recent federal government study found that a third of our homeless live in places 'not meant for human habitation.' This is a serious moral failing of our government and our nation. Our veterans have done everything we have asked of them and more, and it's time we honor our sacred contract with them.
"While George Bush and Bill O'Reilly continue to ignore our homeless veterans, the American people, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, must speak out and stand up for those who have stood up for us. We must do everything we can to solve this terrible problem – and we must begin by reaching out to these men and women who are suffering – not pretending they do not exist. After our veterans have served our country honorably, isn't one homeless veteran one too many?"
