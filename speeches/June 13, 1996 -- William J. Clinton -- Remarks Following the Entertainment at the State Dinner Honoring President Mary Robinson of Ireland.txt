    Weren't they wonderful tonight? They made us all so happy. [Applause]
I also want to say to President Robinson that she brought America a little of the luck of the Irish. I am pleased to announce to you that while we were here at dinner the long standoff with the freemen in Montana ended peacefully tonight. I want to thank the FBI and the local law enforcement officials and say I am very, very proud of them. I know I speak for all of our people, when we say we'll all say a little prayer tonight of gratitude for this peaceful resolution of a difficult situation.
Finally, you heard President Robinson say this is an Irish event and it can't end early, so after we break up, the Air Force Airmen of Note will be playing here. We urge you to stay and dance to your heart's content or till the angry neighbors run us off. [Laughter] My experience is that will be quite some time. You can make it until dawn. [Laughter]
Again, I thank you, Mary Chapin Carpenter; thank you, Mary Black; thank you, gentlemen. It was a wonderful, wonderful evening. And most of all, thank you, President Robinson. Thank you, Nick. It's been wonderful for Hillary and me to have you here. Bless you.
