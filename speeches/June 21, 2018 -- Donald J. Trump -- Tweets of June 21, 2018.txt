We shouldn't be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the Wall hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.Retweets: 27946Favorites: 105311

The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years. At some point Schumer and Pelosi who are weak on Crime and Border security will be forced to do a real deal so easy that solves this long time problem. Schumer used to want Border security - now he'll take Crime!Retweets: 17939Favorites: 72348

I will be going the Columbia South Carolina on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.

What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the Mid-Terms). Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Rule-it is killing you!Retweets: 20623Favorites: 77658

Democrats want open Borders where anyone can come into our Country and stay. This is Nancy Pelosi's dream. It won't happen!Retweets: 25463Favorites: 104682

My Administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border. Loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border Democrats...and that's what they are - they're extremist open border Democrats.... https://t.co/F73I5gu0Q5Retweets: 19376Favorites: 70977

'I REALLY DON'T CARE DO U?' written on the back of Melania's jacket refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares!Retweets: 41413Favorites: 159572

You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including 'heart' without getting Dem votes. Problem is they don't care about security and R's do. Zero Dems voted to support the Goodlatte Bill. They won't vote for anything!Retweets: 23606Favorites: 84563
