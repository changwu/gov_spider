    "I am deeply concerned about efforts in Missouri and at least 19 other states to erect even higher barriers to voting than Indiana's unnecessary and unfair voter identification law - a law that the Supreme Court unfortunately upheld last month. By trying to require not just photo identification but proof of citizenship - proof that thousands of American citizens can't produce through no fault of their own - cynical Republican lawmakers are trying to build new walls between hundreds of thousands of eligible senior, minority, and low-income Americans and their civil right to choose their own leaders.
"Republicans claim that these requirements are needed to prevent fraud, but the reality is that they do little more than disenfranchise eligible voters. I believe that we should start from the premise that voting is a right, not a privilege, and we should make sure that the ballot box is open to every eligible citizen in our country. That is why I have been a strong and vocal opponent of these voter ID measures."
