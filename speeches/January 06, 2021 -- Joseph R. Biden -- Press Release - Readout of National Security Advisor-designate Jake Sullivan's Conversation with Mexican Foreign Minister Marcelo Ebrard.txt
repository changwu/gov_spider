    National Security Advisor-designate Jake Sullivan held a telephone conversation today with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard as a follow-up to the December 19, 2020 call between President-elect Joe Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The conversation kept with the longstanding tradition of high-level interaction between incoming U.S. administrations and the government of Mexico. The discussion focused entirely on matters that will arise after January 20 in preparation for cooperation between the two countries, including on efforts to ensure safe, orderly, and humane migration.
