    From November 15-17, Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger traveled to Japan to continue the Biden-Harris Administration's coordination with international partners to advance cybersecurity, promote responsible state behavior in cyberspace, and chart a 21st century course for cybersecurity and emerging technology. The United States and Japan are committed to deepening our Alliance and to fulfilling its potential, including by promoting secure connectivity and a vibrant digital economy while enhancing the cybersecurity capacity needed to address shared threats.
Neuberger met with a range of Government of Japan officials to consult on bolstering resilience and countering malicious cyber activity including cybercrime, as well as enhancing ICT vendor diversity, for which the United States commends Japanese industry's advancements. Finally, recognizing the importance of public and private sector cooperation, Neuberger also met with private sector representatives to discuss the key role of industry in advancing our shared objectives on cybersecurity and emerging technology. Across all of her engagements, Neuberger emphasized the importance of deepening U.S-Japan collaboration in strengthening network defenses against cyber threats as part of their long-standing alliance partnership on cybersecurity.
Neuberger's trip builds on the Biden Administration's ongoing work to build international cooperation to address cyber threats. The Administration's efforts have included rallying G7 countries to hold nations who harbor ransomware criminals accountable; working with allies and partners to impose costs on nation-states for malicious cyber activity, and disrupt the ransomware ecosystem; hosting an international counter-ransomware initiative at the White House in October with over 30 countries and the European Union to accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware and launching a Quad Senior Cyber Group to deepen cooperation in areas like secure technology, critical infrastructure and workforce. Last week, Neuberger was in Brussels where she met with a range of EU officials and members of the European Parliament to discuss cybersecurity and emerging technology policies and consulted with the North Atlantic Council at NATO on ways to enhance national and Alliance resilience in cyberspace, following NATO's adoption of a new Cyber Defense Policy, its first in seven years, strongly supported by the United States.
