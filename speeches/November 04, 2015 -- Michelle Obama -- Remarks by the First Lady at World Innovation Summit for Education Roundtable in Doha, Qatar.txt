    MRS. OBAMA: I am not going to speak for long, because I just spoke. But I'm grateful to -- that you all have taken the time to be here. I of course want to thank Sheikha Moza for her leadership and for being just such a gracious host to me during my stay.
My purpose for being here is really to learn and to listen. Let Girls Learn is a very new initiative in the United States. It is one that we are starting here in the White House, but it's going to be a lifelong goal for myself as well as for my husband. And part of what I'm trying to do is learn from best practices to figure out what's the best space for someone like me to occupy; how to use not just this platform, but the next platform or two that I will have to continue to shine light on this issue.
And the best way for me to do that is hear from experts and activists, and powerful women like all of you. So I am going to turn this off and make sure you're turning yours on. I look forward to hearing from you and continuing this work for a very long time to come.
Thank you.
