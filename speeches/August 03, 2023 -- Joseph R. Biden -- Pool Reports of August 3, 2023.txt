Out of town pool report #1 - holding at Gordon's Pond
Good morning from Rehoboth Beach on the last full day of POTUS's vacation here.
Pool is holding at Gordon's Pond near the bike path after call time, initially at 10 a.m., was moved up (at 8:05) to 8:20.
It's a bit cooler and cloudier today, with some light rain possible later this morning.

Out of town pool report #2 - bike ride
POTUS rode around the bend on his bicycle and past the pool at 9:13 a.m. A single Secret Service officer pedaled behind him and there were two biking in front.
He waved to the pool as he passed. He did not reply to a shouted question about whether he's been briefed on Niger. Then Katie Rogers asked if he would talk to us on his return. He replied: "Probably not."
He wore a helmet, aviators, black t-shirt and his blue and black swim trunks with turtles on them.
Pool holding now nearby.

Out of town pool report #3 - bike ride return
POTUS rode back from the bike trail and headed toward his home, passing by the pool and a crowd of about 70 onlookers (including multiple cyclists temporarily blocked from accessing the trail, several young children and two dogs) standing along the road at 10:21.
There was some light cheering from the crowd as he rode by.
POTUS smiled as he passed us but did not respond to a shouted question asking if he had any comment on Trump's arraignment in DC later.
Pool will be holding in our van for now.
