    The President today designated the Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Quayle, as the appropriate council to review issues raised in conjunction with the regulatory program under Executive Order 12498. The President has also directed the Council on Competitiveness to exercise the same authority over regulatory issues as did the Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief under Executive Order 12291, which established the administration's regulatory review process.
In taking these actions, the President reaffirmed his commitment to regulatory relief and the use of cost-benefit principles to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens from American businesses, workers, and consumers.
