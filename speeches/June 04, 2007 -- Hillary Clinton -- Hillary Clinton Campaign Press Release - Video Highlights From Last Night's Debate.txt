    With the second Democratic debate now in the history books, we thought you'd want to see some of the video highlights from last night's event and the ensuing coverage which confirmed that Hillary showed that she is ready to lead.
Hillary rose above the fray and made clear that Democrats are united in wanting to end the war in Iraq and focusing on health care. She laid out clear and concise ideas for bringing the troops home and articulated how, as president, she'll deliver the change Americans want.
Debate host WMUR's real-time, dial test focus group of New Hampshire voters confirmed that Hillary stood out as a leader. The focus group respondents viewed Clinton favorably prior to the debate and felt even more strongly about her afterward, increasing her ratings by a remarkable 21 points! Both men and women evaluated Clinton similarly and both groups proportionately increased their favorable evaluations of her. The bottom line is that Hillary made strong gains last night while her principal opponents stood still or lost ground. Hillary was the runaway winner and showed she is the one to end the war.
Below are some of the video highlights and coverage from last night's Democratic debate.
