    President Obama and President Sleiman spoke by phone today to discuss their shared commitment to preserving Lebanon's stability, sovereignty, and security, particularly in relation to the ongoing conflict in Syria. President Obama expressed his appreciation to President Sleiman and the Lebanese people for keeping Lebanon's borders open and hosting refugees from Syria, and pledged continued U.S. support to help Lebanon manage this challenge. The two leaders agreed that all parties should respect Lebanon's policy of disassociation from the conflict in Syria and avoid actions that will involve the Lebanese people in the conflict. President Obama stressed his concern about Hizballah's active and growing role in Syria, fighting on behalf of the Assad regime, which is counter to the Lebanese government's policies. President Obama also commended President Sleiman's leadership in overseeing the government transition in Lebanon and reiterated the importance of Lebanon holding parliamentary elections in a timely manner in keeping with legal and constitutional requirements.
