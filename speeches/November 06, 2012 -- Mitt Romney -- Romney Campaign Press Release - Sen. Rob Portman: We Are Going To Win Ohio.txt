SEN. ROB PORTMAN: "I think we're going to win in Ohio. I got a good feel for it on the ground. I didn't feel this in 2008, frankly. But we've got the momentum. Folks are really fired up. If you look at our crowds, you can see it. But, again, also look at our grassroots operation which is driven by volunteers. People are passionate this year. They don't like what happened in the last four years. They don't want to see it repeated and they are worried about their kids and their grandkids and what kind of future they are going to have. They like the fact that Mitt Romney is finishing with a positive optimistic message about the future."
