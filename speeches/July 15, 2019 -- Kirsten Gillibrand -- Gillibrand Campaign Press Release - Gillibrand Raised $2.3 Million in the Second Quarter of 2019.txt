    Second Quarter Investments + Powerful Support from Women
Kirsten raised $2.3 million with an average grassroots donation of $15. Overall, 95% of contributions were under $50. The campaign ended the quarter with more than $8.2 million cash on hand.
Of Gillibrand's online donors, 65% identified as women. The campaign has experienced outsized growth since the start of May, and is on pace to hit the 130,000 donors needed to qualify for the fall debates.
Building In-House Data & Digital Infrastructure For Long-Term Success
In the second quarter, the campaign made smart investments to grow and utilize a data-driven approach to voter outreach, targeting likely supporters and employing modeling to engage new primary voters and caucus-goers.
Additionally, the campaign brought its national digital and data apparatuses in-house, including digital advertising and fundraising, and began placing data teams within the states to provide real time, on-the-ground targeting capabilities.
The campaign also put in place the infrastructure to launch peer-to-peer, neighbor-to-neighbor organizing, where Gillibrand supporters can engage with their friends and family in ways that will matter on caucus and primary day. Nationally, the campaign is digitally organizing volunteers, online and offline, to elect Kirsten Gillibrand.
In the month of July, Kirsten's staff is continuing to grow, reaching 35 people in Iowa and 20 people in New Hampshire by the end of the month.
