LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted an amazing more than 5,200 supporters and undecided voters to a college campus town hall meeting in Wisconsin, breaking his record of drawing large crowds to campaign events.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas' campus town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. CST outdoors on the Memorial Union Terrace — Waterfront, located at 800 Langdon Street, Madison, WI 53706. Event organizers noted that the thousands of event attendees braved a brisk 40-degree breeze emanating from nearby lakes Mendota and Monona.
At the event, Dr. Paul spoke to an admiring crowd about the need for constitutionally-limited government, the enduring ties between civil and economic liberties, and key elements of his 'Plan to Restore America,' an oft-praised economic blueprint designed to reverse the rapid growth in government, spending, and borrowing that threatens prosperity and freedom.
Just yesterday, Dr. Paul drew a crowd of more than 2,000 people to his University of Maryland — College Park town hall meeting held inside Ritchie Coliseum.
