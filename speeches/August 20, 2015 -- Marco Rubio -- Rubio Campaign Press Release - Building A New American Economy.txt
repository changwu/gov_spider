    
The New American Economy is not built on a single change, but on change itself. It's built on the fact that numerous transformative innovations have come in the last five years, and even more will come in the next five. These constant advances in technology are replacing old jobs with new ones, and have turned our economy from national to international.
While America's economy is built on change, it is increasingly controlled by a federal government that is resistant to change. Other nations are adapting to the new economy while Washington is clinging to the ways of the old economy. As a result, America is no longer the obvious best place for the Henry Fords of today to create the businesses of tomorrow. And while innovations keep transforming our world, our economy is struggling to translate them into opportunity for our people.
This election is a choice about what we do next.
Hillary Clinton believes the way to win the race for the future is to drive in reverse â€” to revert back to more regulations, higher taxes, and bigger government.
It's not.
The way forward is to embrace the future and modernize our government. If we once again make America the best place in the world to create jobs, and empower every American to fill those jobs, then our generation will embrace The New American Economy and lay the foundation for A New American Century.
