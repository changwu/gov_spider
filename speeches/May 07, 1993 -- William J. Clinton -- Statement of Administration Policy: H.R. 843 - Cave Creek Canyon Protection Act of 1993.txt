    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/10/93)(House)(Kolbe (R) Arizona)
The Administration supports H.R. 843.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 843 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimate is zero.
