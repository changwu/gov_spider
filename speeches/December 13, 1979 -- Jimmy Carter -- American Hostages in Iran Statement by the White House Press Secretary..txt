    We have read reports from Iran today that international observers will be allowed to see our people who are being held hostage.
I want to emphasize that for any such visit to the hostages to accomplish a humanitarian objective and to be responsive to international opinion and to acceptable standards of behavior, it is important that those who see the hostages be allowed to see all of them, to talk with them, and to report to the families of the hostages and to the world on the condition of each hostage. Any observers allowed on the Embassy compound should be qualified, internationally recognized, impartial, neutral observers and should include a qualified medical doctor. Visits by these observers should occur regularly and frequently until the hostages are released.
If this occurs, we would consider it a step forward.
