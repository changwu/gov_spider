  A Proclamation

In the continuing fight against crime and drug abuse, our Nation's correctional officers are unsung heroes. The contributions they make to American law enforcement, while not highly visible, are substantial. These men and women are responsible for ensuring the custody, control, and safety of inmates held in U.S. jails and prisons. Directly supervising the incarceration and rehabilitation of criminal offenders, correctional officers are an essential part of our Nation's criminal justice system.
Correctional officers help to maintain the public safety by preserving order in our Nation's jails and prisons. They also help inmates to develop the skills necessary to become productive members of society. These are very difficult tasks -- tasks that can be dangerous as well as frustrating.
This week, we give America's correctional officers due recognition and respect and salute them for their vigilance and courage. In the future, as we strive to put more drug dealers and other criminals behind bars, let us always remember that it is correctional officers who help to make our efforts complete.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 135, has designated the week beginning May 7, 1989, as "National Correctional Officers Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 7, 1989, as National Correctional Officers Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.

GEORGE BUSH
