    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Public Law 100-204, section 904(d), I am pleased to transmit a report on the roles and responsibilities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of State in administering the United States refugee admissions program. Recommendations for improving the program's effectiveness and efficiency over the next few years are also included.
I am proud of the roles both the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of State have played in the implementation of the Refugee Act of 1980. While improvements can still be made in the operations of both the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of State as well as in other aspects of the admissions program, the programs, procedures, and processes established since 1980 represent a positive legacy for the next administration.
