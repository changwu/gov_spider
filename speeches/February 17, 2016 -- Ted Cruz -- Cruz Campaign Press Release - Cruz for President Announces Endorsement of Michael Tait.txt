HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Michael Tait, lead singer for the Newsboys, a nationally acclaimed Christian pop/rock band.
Tait praised Cruz to Fox News columnist Todd Starnes and in a video last week. "People of faith should vote for a man they believe in, a man they feel can do the job, not falter, not say one thing before the election and do another whole thing after the election, a man that stands his ground, keeps his word, protects our freedom — that's who you should vote for," Tait said. "I saw him, his family, the way he talked to people in person. I saw his drive, his hunger for solid principles, solid ideas going forward in our country that, even as an African-American, if you want to get really technical about it, I support 100 percent."
Tait, a graduate of Liberty University, launched a successful career in contemporary Christian music, forming DC Talk in 1988 and ultimately winning four Grammys. He was announced as the Newsboys' lead singer in 2009.
"I have enjoyed getting to know the Newsboys and am thrilled to have Michael's support," said Cruz. "Michael Tait is a powerful voice for the gospel, encouraging Christians to live their faith with joy and courage. Together, as people of faith rise up against the Washington cartel, we will reignite the promise of America."
In August, the Newsboys performed at Cruz's Rally for Religious Liberty in Des Moines Iowa, the largest Iowa campaign event of the 2016 election cycle up until that date. Their new hit single "Guilty" highlights the religious liberty crisis in America, which Cruz has made a foundation of his campaign and is the top issue for Americans of faith. The song begins —
"When did it become breaking a rule 
To say Your name out loud in school 
When Your name's the only that sets us free?"
