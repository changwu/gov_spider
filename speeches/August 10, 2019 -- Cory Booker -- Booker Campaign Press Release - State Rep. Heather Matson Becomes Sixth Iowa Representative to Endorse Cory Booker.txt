    Des Moines, IA - During his eighth swing through Iowa on a busy State Fair weekend, today Cory Booker earned the endorsement of Representative Heather Matson of Ankeny, making her the sixth Iowa legislator to endorse Cory's candidacy for president, the most of any candidate. Named one of the Des Moines Register's "50 Most Wanted Democrats," last year Rep. Matson defeated a five-term Republican incumbent in House District 38, which represents part of the Des Moines suburbs.
"Cory Booker leads with passion, honesty, and a commitment to civic grace at a time when we need to be reminded of who we can be as a country. I support Cory because he inspires us to rise to the challenges we face as a nation and I think he is the candidate who will inspire Americans to believe in each other again," said State Representative Heather Matson.
"Our plan from day one has been to build an organization of community leaders across Iowa who reflect Cory's values of service, integrity, and bold leadership, and Representative Matson is a perfect fit. Rep. Matson is a political force to be reckoned with who will not only help Cory win in February but help flip Iowa blue in 2020," said Cory 2020 Iowa State Director Mike Frosolone.
Representative Matson joins the largest list of influential Iowa leaders backing any presidential contender in Iowa, including State Representatives Amy Nielsen and Jennifer Konfrst, who became the first two Iowa legislators to endorse any candidate in the 2020 field, and former State House Minority Leader Mark Smith, State Representative Kenan Judge and State Representative Monica Kurth, who endorsed Cory on Wednesday.
