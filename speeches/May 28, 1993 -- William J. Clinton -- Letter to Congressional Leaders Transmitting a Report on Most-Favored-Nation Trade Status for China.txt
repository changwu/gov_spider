    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1) ("the Act"), I hereby submit the attached report concerning the continuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act to the People's Republic of China. The report explains my reasons for having determined that continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's Republic of China will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. In addition, I am also transmitting herewith for your further information a copy of an Executive Order which enumerates the specific conditions which I have established with respect to a further extension of the waiver next year for the period beginning July 3, 1994.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
