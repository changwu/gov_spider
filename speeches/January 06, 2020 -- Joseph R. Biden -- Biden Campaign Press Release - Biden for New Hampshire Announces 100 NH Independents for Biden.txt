    Former Republican Senator Gordon Humphrey and former Republican NH First Lady Dorothy Peterson join independent voters across New Hampshire who believe Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat President Trump and restore the soul of our nation
Manchester, New Hampshire â€” Today, Biden for New Hampshire announced NH Independents for Biden, including 100 independents from across the state who believe Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat President Trump and restore the soul of our nation.
"For the sake of our national security, it's urgent we replace President Trump in November," said former Republican U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey. "President Trump has jeopardized our international alliances, and what we need now more than ever is strong, steady leadership, not government by tantrums and tweets. I am confident that Joe Biden will restore calm and rationality to the White House and rebuild America's standing in the world. I served with Joe Biden for 12 years in the United States Senate. I know him and trust him. No one comes close to his experience or his ability to achieve bi-partisan consensus."
"President Trump has created chaos, instituted a culture of corruption, debased our nation's global standing, and frayed our moral and ethical fabric. We cannot allow blind party loyalty to tether us to what we know is wrong," said former Republican First Lady of New Hampshire Dorothy Peterson. "We must do what is right for future generations and put the United States back on the right track. Joe Biden is the measured voice and steady hand we need to bring stability and unity back to our country."
"I've voted for Republicans and I've voted for Democrats. Everyone deserves the right to access health care. Those who are fortunate to have employer provided health insurance deserve the option to keep it. Our country needs a leader with a strong moral character. Joe Biden is the leader we need," said Jed Carpentier, an undeclared voter from Exeter.
These NH Independents for Biden are part of a broader effort by Biden for New Hampshire to speak directly to independent voters over the next six weeks.
