    This year marks the 20th anniversary of Citizens Band radio. CB is now a widely used emergency communications system. It helps keep motorists safe on our Nation's highways by providing faster notification of highway accidents, increased detection of reckless driving, and more information to reduce traffic delays. The CB is also effective in emergencies unrelated to motor vehicles. By allowing for citizens' participation in public safety, we greatly enhance that safety.
The growth of CB use in recent years is extraordinary. The Federal Communications Commission has now issued nearly 14 million licenses. More than 20 million Americans have used a CB radio at one time or another.
While CB is primarily for emergency use, the nonemergency channels bring enjoyment and companionship to millions of Americans, including my own family.
In recognition of the fine service provided by Citizens Band radio, I join with CB organizations across the country in celebrating "10-4 Day," October 4, 1978.
