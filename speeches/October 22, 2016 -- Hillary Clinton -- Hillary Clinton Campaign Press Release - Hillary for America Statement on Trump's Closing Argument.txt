    HFA Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds offered the following statement on Trump's "closing argument" speech today in Gettysburg, PA:
"Today, in what was billed as a major closing argument speech, Trump's major new policy was to promise political and legal retribution against the women who have accused him of groping them. Like Trump's campaign, this speech gave us a troubling view as to what a Trump State of the Union would sound likeâ€”rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families."
