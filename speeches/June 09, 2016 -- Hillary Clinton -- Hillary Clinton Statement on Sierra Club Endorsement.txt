    Today, following the endorsement of the Sierra Club, the environmental organization founded more than 100 years ago by pioneering conservationist John Muir, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement. Clinton previously earned the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters and of the NRDC Action Fund:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Sierra Club, an organization that has fought to protect our environment, our natural wonders, and the health of our children for more than a century.
"Climate change is real and we can see its impacts in our communities right now. We need to take immediate action to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, create good-paying jobs, and make sure no one is left out or left behind, from communities struggling with the legacy of environmental racism to the coalfield communities that kept America's lights on for generations.
"The stakes for our children's health and the future of our planet have never been higher. Donald Trump has called climate change a Chinese hoax and said he will scrap the landmark Paris climate agreement. He has pledged to open up millions of acres of pristine public lands and waters to fossil fuel production at a time when America's public lands are under unprecedented pressures.  We need to be accelerating the transition to a clean energy future and creating thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs, not letting a climate denier anywhere near the White House.
"The challenges facing our environment have changed since John Muir's day, but one thing remains the same–there is no Planet B."
