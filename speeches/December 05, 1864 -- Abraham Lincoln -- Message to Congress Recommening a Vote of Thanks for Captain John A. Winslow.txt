    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that Captain John A. Winslow, United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from Congress for the skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the brilliant action, while in command of the United States steamer Kearsarge, which led to the total destruction of the piratical craft Alabama on the 19th of June, 1864--a vessel superior in tonnage, superior in number of guns, and superior in number of crew.
This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the following words, namely:
That any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
