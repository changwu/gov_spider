    Unemployment near a record low and the share of working-age Americans who have jobs at a 20-year high: That's Bidenomics. Our economy added 187,000 jobs last month, and we've added 13.4 million jobs since I took office, more jobs added in 2Â½ years than during any President's 4-year term. The unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, marking a full year and half below 4 percent. This follows recent news that our economy continues to grow, while inflation has fallen by nearly two-thirds and is at its lowest level in more than 2 years. We're growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, lowering costs for hard-working families, and making smart investments in America.
