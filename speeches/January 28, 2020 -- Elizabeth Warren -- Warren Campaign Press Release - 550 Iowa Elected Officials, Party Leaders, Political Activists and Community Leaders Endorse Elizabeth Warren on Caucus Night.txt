    What We've Built: Elizabeth Warren Enters Caucuses with Widest, Deepest Coalition of Iowa Support
More than 550 Iowa elected officials, party leaders, political activists and community leaders will stand with Elizabeth on caucus night 
West Des Moines, Iowa—Elizabeth Warren and her Iowa campaign are building a grassroots movement for big, structural change, and with less than a week remaining before the Feb. 3 caucuses the scale of that movement is now fully evident.
Elizabeth has built the widest and deepest pool of Iowa political support in the 2020 presidential field. She has unified the Democratic Party behind her vision for ending corruption, ensuring opportunity for all and choosing hope over fear for the future of our country.
With Saturday's endorsement by the Des Moines Register editorial board and the announcement of more than 40 new endorsements on Sunday, Elizabeth now has more than 550 named Iowa political endorsers, representing every facet of our party and widening the Democratic tent to welcome newly engaged Iowans and those who previously supported a different party.
Elizabeth is popular with dozens of elected officials who have won votes and represented Iowans at every level of government.. She's the choice for scores of party leaders and activists who turn out voters and perform the essential work of grassroots democracy. She's the top choice for more than 100 student leaders at Iowa high schools and colleges. She has the support of over 100 labor leaders and union members, and has the backing of more than 70 veterans and military family members. More than 40 Iowans who previously identified as Republicans or supported Donald Trump are proudly supporting Elizabeth next Monday.
Below is the full list of Elizabeth's Iowa endorsements. Every name represents an Iowan who will stand up at their local precinct on Monday night to make an enthusiastic, positive case for electing Elizabeth Warren to be our next president.
