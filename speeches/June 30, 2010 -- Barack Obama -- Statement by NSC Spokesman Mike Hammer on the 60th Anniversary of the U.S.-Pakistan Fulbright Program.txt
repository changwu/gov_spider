    Today, the United States and Pakistan celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Fulbright academic exchange program and the growth of U.S.-Pakistan educational cooperation. President Obama congratulates the bilateral U.S.-Pakistan Fulbright Program and welcomes the latest group of 158 Pakistani Fulbright students coming to study in America. Our countries are strengthened by the people-to-people ties built by this program and the alumni of other U.S. sponsored academic and professional exchanges. As the President has said “both America and Pakistan care deeply about the education of our young people for the jobs and economies of the future.”
As part of the growing U.S.-Pakistan relationship, the United States has dramatically increased academic and professional exchange programs with Pakistan. This year the United States will send almost 2,500 Pakistani students, teachers and other professionals to the United States on exchange programs and will also send American scholars to teach and conduct research at universities in Pakistan.
