Pool report #2: Background on speech 
You may have already seen this, but passing along on background from a White House official re: the president's speech tonight:
Today, on the one-year anniversary of the shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden will deliver his first primetime address. We expect the speech to run under 20 minutes. Below are a few of the focuses:

The President will talk about the sacrifices made by the American people, the more than 500,000 lives lost, and the millions of people whose lives have been changed by the pandemic.
He will speak about how this has been the greatest operational challenge the country has faced and the work his team has done to rapidly increase the number of vaccinations, vaccinators, and vaccination sites up and running.
And the President will lay out the next steps he will take to get the pandemic under control, level with the American people about what is still required to defeat the virus, and provide a hopeful vision of what is possible if we all come together.
