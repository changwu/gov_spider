    LOS ANGELES, CA — Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, delivered her message of aloha and service above self to a thunderous audience at the historic First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles. After a venue change to this new location to accommodate the overwhelming response from LA residents to hear Tulsi speak, the campaign still had to rely on an overflow space for the growing crowd.
Tulsi shared her experiences serving as a soldier in the Army National Guard, being deployed twice to the Middle East, serving in Congress for more than six years, and on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees. To cheers and applause, she explained that as commander in chief, she will end wasteful regime change war policies, work to end the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and take the trillions of dollars spent on those wars to instead serve the needs of America's people—ensuring healthcare for all, fixing the country's crumbling infrastructure, protecting the environment, and other domestic priorities.
Yesterday in Los Angeles, Tulsi spoke in depth about her policies and platform to best serve the country in a four-part media blitz with hosts of the Kim Iversen Show , Niko House and the co-hosts of Convo Couch , The Jimmy Dore Show , and The Young Turks . Grassroots support continues to build for Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign, which has already garnered contributions from more than 50,000 unique donors.
