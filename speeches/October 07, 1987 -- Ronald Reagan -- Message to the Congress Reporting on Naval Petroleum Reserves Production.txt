    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422(c)), I wish to inform you of my decision to extend the period of maximum efficient rate production of the naval petroleum reserves for a period of three years from April 5, 1988, the expiration of the currently authorized period of production.
I am transmitting herewith a copy of the report investigating the necessity of continued production of the reserves as required by section 7422(c)(2)(B) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. In light of the findings contained in that report, I hereby certify that continued production from the naval petroleum reserves is in the national interest.
RONALD REAGAN
