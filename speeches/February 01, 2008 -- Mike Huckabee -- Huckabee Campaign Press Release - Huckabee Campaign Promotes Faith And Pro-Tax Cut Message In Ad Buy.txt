    Little Rock, AR â€“ Presidential Candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is hitting the airwaves with two television ads geared to help Feb. 5 primary state voters understand his record in public service, vision for America's future, and plans to strengthen the U.S. economy.
"Believe," a 30-second ad, will be a part of a national cable buy that was launched Jan. 31st. It will also broadcast in key Southern states, including: Alabama, Missouri, Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
"Faith doesn't just influence me, it really defines me," says Huckabee on camera, echoing a sentiment he often expresses on the campaign trail. "Believe" reiterates Huckabee's strong stand on pro-life issues, including his belief that life begins at conception, and dedication to conservative values. "Let us never sacrifice our principles for anybody's politics. Not now. Not ever."
The second 30-second ad, "Common Sense," begins airing on Friday, February 1st, on national cable networks. "Common Sense" highlights Huckabee's Main Street message and the need for major reform in Washington, beginning with abolishing the IRS and ensuring that taxation, regulation, litigation are kept to the bare minimum.
The ad echoes a major campaign theme by Huckabee that he'll lead the fight to help Americans keep their jobs and paychecks. "This ad highlights a high priority for Governor Huckabee, that he wants to be the president that nails the going out of business sign on the IRS," said Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman.
