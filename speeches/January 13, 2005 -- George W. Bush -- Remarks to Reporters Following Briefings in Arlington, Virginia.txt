    War on Terror/Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunamis Disaster Relief
The President. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for the briefing that we just had. The Secretary arranged for a briefing from Admiral Fargo and our commanders on the ground who are providing organization and handling the relief effort for the victims of the tsunamis. I got to tell you, our military is making a significant difference in providing relief and aid and help and compassion for those who have suffered. I am very impressed, Mr. Secretary, by how quickly we have responded and the assets that you have ordered deployed to help these people. And there's a lot of talk about how some in the world don't appreciate America. Well, I can assure you that those who have been helped by our military appreciate America.
We also talked about the war on terror. We're constantly reviewing our strategy as to how to defeat the enemy—fully recognize that the war on terror will require a coordinated effort within our own Government as well as a coordinated effort with the countries around the world which understand the stakes of this war. I am pleased with the response from around the world, appreciate so many nations understanding that we must work together to defeat these killers. I'm mindful of the fact that we have—constantly have got to review our plans and never lose our will.
So, Mr. Secretary, thanks for the briefing. It was a very good briefing, and you're doing a fine job on behalf of the American people.
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Thank you, sir.
The President. Thank you all.
