    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On September 21, 1994, I determined and reported to the Congress that the Russian Federation was in "full compliance" with the freedom of emigration criteria of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. On June 3, 1997, I determined and reported to the Congress that Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine were in "full compliance" with the freedom of emigration criteria of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. On December 5, 1997, I determined and reported to the Congress that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan were in "full compliance" with the freedom of emigration criteria of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. These actions allowed for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status and certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. You will find that the report indicates continued compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration for these countries.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
