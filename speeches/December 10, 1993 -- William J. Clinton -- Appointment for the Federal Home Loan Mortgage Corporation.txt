    The President announced today that he intends to appoint three individuals, Jerry Mac-Arthur Hultin, Raymond J. McClendon, and James B. Nutter, to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by Congress in 1970 which supports home ownership and rental housing through the creation and development of a secondary market for residential mortgages.
"Jerry Hultin, Raymond McClendon, and James Nutter all bring years of financial management experience to the task of overseeing the important work of Freddie Mac," said the President. "I appreciate their willingness to serve."
