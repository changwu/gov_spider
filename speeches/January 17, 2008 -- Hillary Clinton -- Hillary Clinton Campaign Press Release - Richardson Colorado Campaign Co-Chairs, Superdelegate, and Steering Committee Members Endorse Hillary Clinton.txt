    Denver, CO â€“ Colorado for Hillary today announced the endorsements of former Richardson Colorado Co-Chairs Polly Baca and Lawrence Martinez, superdelegate Ramona Martinez, and Richardson Steering Committee members Val Vigil and Tish Maes.

"As someone who has worked for the advancement of the Hispanic community, I share Clinton's commitment to creating opportunity for all Americans. Clinton knows that change requires hard work.

Martinez also served as President of the Denver City Council.
