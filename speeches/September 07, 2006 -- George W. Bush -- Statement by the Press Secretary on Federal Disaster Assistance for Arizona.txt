    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Arizona and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding during the period of July 25 to August 4, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of Pima and Pinal, the Gila River Indian Community within Pinal County, and the Tohono O'Odham Nation within Pima and Pinal Counties.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
