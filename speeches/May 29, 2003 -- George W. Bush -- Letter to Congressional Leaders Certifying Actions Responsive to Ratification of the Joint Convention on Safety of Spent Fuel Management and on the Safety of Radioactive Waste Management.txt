    Dear __________:
In response to sections 2(1) and 2(2)(C) of the resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the Joint Convention on Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, adopted by the United States Senate on April 2, 2003, I hereby certify that the United States will take those actions specified in section 2(1) and that the Comptroller General shall have the access specified in section 2(2)(C). The executive branch shall implement the foregoing in a manner and to the extent consistent with the President's constitutional authority to conduct the foreign affairs of the United States, supervise the unitary executive branch, and withhold information the disclosure of which could impair the foreign relations of the United States, the national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
