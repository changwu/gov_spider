    The President today announced the Presidential Scholars for 1980. They are 141 graduating high school seniors, chosen on the basis of academic achievement, leadership, community involvement, and demonstrated excellence in the areas of visual and performing arts or creative writing. The Scholars will visit Washington from June 29 to July 2, 1980, as guests of the White House and the Department of Education.
The Presidential Scholars program, established by Executive order in 1964, annually honors one boy and one girl from each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Americans living abroad, and 35 students selected at large.
The students, from both public and private schools, are initially identified through scores on precollege examinations nationally administered in secondary schools. The scholars are selected by the Commission on Presidential Scholars, a panel of private citizens from a variety of fields, who serve without compensation.
During their visit to Washington, the Scholars will receive Presidential Scholars medallions in a White House ceremony. They will also attend seminars with authorities in many fields, meet with their elected officials, and visit historic sites. The Scholars receive no financial award.
