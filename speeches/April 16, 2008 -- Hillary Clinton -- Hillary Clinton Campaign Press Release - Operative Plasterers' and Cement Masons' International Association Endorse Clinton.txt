    The Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association (OPCMIA) announced its endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President today. The labor union represents about 45,000 plasterers and cement masons in the construction industry in North America.
"We need a leader with Hillary Clinton's ability to turn around the economy and rebuild the middle class," said OPCMIA President Pat Finley. "She has a clear record fighting for working families, and is the strongest candidate to go toe-to-toe with John McCain in November."
"I am honored to have the support of the hard working men and women of the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association," Clinton said. "It's time America's working families had a partner in the White House."
Hillary has been endorsed by more than a dozen unions representing about 6 million working families nationwide, including: International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Transportation Communications Union; National Association of Letter Carriers; International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers; American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers; Amalgamated Transit Union; Office and Professional Employees International Union; the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts; International Union of Painters and Allied Trades; and the United Farm Workers.
