    The Senate Democratic budget is a concrete plan that will grow our economy and shrink our deficits in a balanced way, consistent with the President's belief that our economy grows best from the middle-out, not the top-down, while reducing the debt as a share of the economy. It's a plan that doesn't dwell on ongoing debates, but rather moves our country forward by making investments critical to our middle-class security – like education, manufacturing, and rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges – while looking for waste, fraud, and savings throughout government. This budget makes tough spending cuts and leaves no sacred cows, but it also makes sure that seniors and the middle class aren't forced to bear the full burden of deficit reduction by eliminating wasteful loopholes through tax reform, so that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.
Republicans and Democrats have now put their plans on the table. And while there are differences, both sides share some common goals. The President looks forward to seeking compromise and common ground with Congress so we can grow the economy, create jobs, and cut the deficit in a balanced way.
