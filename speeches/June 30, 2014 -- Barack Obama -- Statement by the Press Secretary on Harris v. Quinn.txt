    Collective bargaining is a fundamental right that helped build America's middle class. The ability of public servants to collectively bargain is crucial to ensuring both a fair day's pay for a hard day's work and the high quality service citizens expect and deserve from their government.
For almost 40 years, the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment allows state and local governments to require employees to pay a fair share of a union's expenses for representing that worker. We are disappointed that the Supreme Court has carved out a group of workers - homecare workers who provide critical support to the elderly and people with disabilities in their own homes.
The collective bargaining model in Illinois resulted in fairer pay and benefits for hardworking caregivers as well as improved training, safety and health protections, and tools to help those who need care to find it. The Court's decision will not only make it significantly harder for these dedicated employees to get a fair shake in exchange for their hard work, but will make it harder for states and cities to ensure the elderly and Americans with disabilities get the care they need and deserve.
The Administration remains committed to defending collective bargaining rights.
