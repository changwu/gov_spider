    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised)
(Senate)(Hollings (D) South Carolina and 49 others)
The President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto S. 549 if it is presented to him in its current form.
The bill would hurt consumers, provoke retaliation against U.S. exports, violate our international obligations, and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for U.S. exports.
