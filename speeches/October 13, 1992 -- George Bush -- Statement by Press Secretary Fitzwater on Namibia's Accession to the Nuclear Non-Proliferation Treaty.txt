    The United States welcomes and commends the Government of Namibia's accession on October 7, 1992, to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The administration has been encouraging President Nujoma to make this important decision. Namibia's accession to the NPT represents a positive response to the international community's heightened concern about the global spread of weapons of mass destruction.
The United States firmly believes this action by Namibia represents another important step toward strengthening international security as well as peace and cooperation in southern Africa.
