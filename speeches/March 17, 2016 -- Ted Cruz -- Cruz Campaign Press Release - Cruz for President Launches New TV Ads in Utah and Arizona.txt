    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, the Cruz for President campaign launched two new TV ads in Utah and Arizona. The ad titled "Lee" is a 30-second spot that will run statewide in Utah featuring Sen. Mike Lee discussing his endorsement of Ted Cruz. In the ad, Lee says that Cruz has done everything he promised voters he would do, including fighting against Obamacare, protecting our First Amendment liberties, and standing up to a lawless Obama administration.
The ad titled "Grant," is a 30-second spot that will run statewide in Arizona. The ad features Steve Ronnebeck, whose son, Grant, was killed by an illegal immigrant who was released from jail but not deported. In the ad, Ronnebeck says that he trusts Ted Cruz because he respects the Constitution and that "it's time we put somebody in office who puts the American people first."
