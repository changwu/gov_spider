    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Packard (R) California and 25 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 849, which would prohibit the payment of Federal relocation benefits to persons who are "not lawfully present" in the United States.
The Administration will seek amendments in the Senate, including an amendment to allow one year for the issuance of implementing regulations, instead of the six months permitted by the bill as reported. Because H.R. 849 will affect a significant number of agencies and outside entities, the Administration will need a full year to coordinate and issue the implementing regulations for the bill.
