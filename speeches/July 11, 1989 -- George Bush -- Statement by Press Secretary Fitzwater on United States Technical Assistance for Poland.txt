    The President today announced a decision to provide technical assistance to Polish independent trade unionists, government officials, and employers to ease the burden of adjustment during the period of economic transition and reform. The workers of Poland will ultimately benefit from their country's reform efforts, but the difficult transition period could jeopardize the reform process, with unemployment possibly being a particularly acute problem.
The Department of Labor, working with the AFL - CIO and American business, will assist Poland in eight areas: training and retraining; job search and employment services; unemployment insurance; entrepreneurial development, self-employment and employee ownership; labor-management relations; labor statistics; worker safety and health, including mine safety; and women in the work force.
The Department of Labor will provide a mix of in-country technical assistance and U.S. domestic activities and, along with other U.S. Government agencies, will help develop policies and programs to set up an effective labor safety net in each of the eight priority areas. The cost of the initiative is approximately $4 million.
