    North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"The Supreme Court's decision today to uphold President Obama's healthcare law is a massive blow to the residents and businesses of North Carolina. It means a future of higher costs, fewer choices and less control over our healthcare decisions, and is a huge setback for small businesses and job creators hesitant to hire new workers. With more than 71,000 North Carolinians who have lost their jobs under this president's watch, we cannot afford this big government takeover of one-sixth of the economy, which comes with skyrocketing costs and massive tax increases. Governor Romney has said all along that we must dedicate ourselves to repealing this law, and that is why the stakes couldn't be higher in this presidential election."
