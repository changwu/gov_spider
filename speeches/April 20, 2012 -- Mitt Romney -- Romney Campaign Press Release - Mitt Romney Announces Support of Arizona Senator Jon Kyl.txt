    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Arizona Senator Jon Kyl.
"Senator Kyl has been a leader in the Senate in the fight to cut spending, make government accountable, and to protect our country," said Mitt Romney. "I am proud to have the support of someone who shares my vision for getting our country on the right track by allowing the private sector to flourish and getting government out of the way. Senator Kyl has been a tremendous public servant for Arizona and I look forward to working with him to reach out to Arizona voters over the next few months."
Announcing his support, Senator Kyl said, "After a long primary, it is time for the Republican Party to come together and support the candidate who will defeat President Obama. That is why I am proud to support Mitt Romney. President Obama's record is full of broken promises and failed policies. Mitt Romney will restore American greatness at home and abroad. He has a bold economic plan that will create jobs and help middle class families prosper. He will also make the 21st century an American century and regain America's respected status in the world. These next months will be hard fought and change will not come easy, but I am proud to stand with Mitt and to do anything I can to make sure he is our next president."
