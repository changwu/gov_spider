    At today's unprecedented meeting in Tokyo, G-8 leaders met with leaders from developing nations and representatives from the private sector and international development institutions. While I regret that I was unable to participate, I look forward to hearing from Secretary Summers and my G-8 colleagues about the discussion and working to ensure that everyone benefits from the global economy.
Building on last year's Cologne debt initiative, the Okinawa summit will create a framework to fight infectious disease, increase access to basic education, and expand opportunity through information technology. Despite a stronger global economy, too many people around the world live every day without essential health care, basic literacy, or the opportunity to share in the benefits of modern technology. I am committed to continuing to work closely with America's partners in the G-8 and the developing world to address these issues, reduce poverty, fight infectious disease, and increase opportunity for all.
