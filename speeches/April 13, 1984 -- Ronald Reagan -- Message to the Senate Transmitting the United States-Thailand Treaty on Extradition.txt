    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and Thailand, signed at Washington on December 14, 1983.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty will facilitate United States efforts to prosecute narcotics conspiracies by expressly providing that conspiracies and attempts to commit extraditable offenses constitute extraditable offenses.
The Treaty follows generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by this Government.
Upon entry into force, it will terminate and supersede the existing Extradition Treaty between the United States and Thailand.
This Treaty will make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
