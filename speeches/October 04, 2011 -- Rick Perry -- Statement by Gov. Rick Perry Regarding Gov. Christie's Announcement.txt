    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's announcement earlier today:
"Chris Christie is a friend, a great governor and rising star in the Republican Party. I'm sure this was an exciting and stressful process for Chris, Mary Pat and his family, but I know they have a bright, successful future ahead of them. Gov. Christie will be a strong asset for the Republican Party as we work to build a national movement to get America working again, reduce the influence of Washington in our lives, and defeat President Obama next year."
