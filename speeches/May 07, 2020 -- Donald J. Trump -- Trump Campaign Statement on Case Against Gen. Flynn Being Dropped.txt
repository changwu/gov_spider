    "After a thorough, independent review, we now know that on Vice President Joe Biden's watch, James Comey and Peter Strzok carried out a corrupt witch hunt 'without any legitimate investigative basis' against a decorated military veteran. Weaponizing the FBI and its surveillance powers to target General Flynn and others associated with President Trump will go down as one of the greatest abuses of power by an administration in American history. It's time for Joe Biden to explain what really happened in that January 5, 2017 Oval Office meeting with Comey, which occurred the day after Strzok intervened to keep the investigation into General Flynn from closing due to a lack of any evidence. The corrupt media will do its best to cover up this scandal, but the Obama-Biden officials responsible for these misdeeds must be held accountable."
