    Boca Raton, FL â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee scored major points during tonight's Republican Presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., emphasizing his plan to strengthen the U.S. economy, his successful record in Arkansas, and his vision for America's future.
"A few months ago, at the debate in Dearborn, Michigan, we were asked how about the economy, everyone said it's going great," Huckabee said. "I was the only one who said it may be great if you're at the top, but it's not so good if you're the ones carrying the luggage, serving the food, or driving the cabs."
"People need a president who understands the totality of the impact of the economy, not just how it affects those at the top," Huckabee said.
"I wasn't in Washington at the time, and that's the reason they should elect me, because I wasn't there messing this all up," Huckabee said.
On the issue of the war, Huckabee said he supported President from the very beginning and "we owe him encouragement, not scorn."
"Now we can look back and say there were not weapons of mass destruction, but that doesn't mean there were not any," Huckabee said. "It's easy to second guess a president, but I hope, if we are elected president, we can stand by our decision and not back down from our decision based on the results of some polls."
When asked about the Fair Tax, Huckabee said "people love it because Americans are currently penalized for productivity in this country."
"The Fair Tax encourages people to work, earn and save," Huckabee said. "The average American realizes there has to be a better system. The current system is irrevocably broken."
When asked about his faith, Huckabee said it gives him a solid core which guides his everyday decisions.
"For me to run from my faith would be impossible," Huckabee said. "I don't feel a person has to share my faith to share my love of this country."
