    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Vento (D) Minnesota and 32 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1939, which would require the Secretary of the Interior to interpret the origins and subsequent development of the United States Constitution at those units of the National Park Service associated with the Constitution. The administration supports the laudable objectives of the bill — in fact, the National Park Service is engaged in a variety of efforts to interpret the Constitution within current budgetary and staff resources. For example:

— Independence National Historical Park, where the bill would require the development of a Constitutional Memorial, already serves as the focal point for the National Park Service's celebration of the Constitution's Bicentennial. Structures within this park are well preserved and serve as worthy memorials to the Constitution;
— The National Park Service has already completed its development of interpretive and educational materials concerning the Constitution for distribution to the public; and
— In appropriate cases involving National Historic Landmarks associated with the U.S. Constitution, such as the Isarah T. Montgomery House, the' National Park Service has provided technical assistance in the form of an in-depth site inspection and condition assessment report.
