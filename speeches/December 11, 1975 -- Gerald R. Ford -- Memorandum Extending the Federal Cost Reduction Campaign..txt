Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
On May 6 of this year, I announced a campaign for cost reduction within the Federal Government. I am pleased and grateful that the response of civilian and military personnel has been outstanding.
It has been my pleasure to sign 362 congratulatory letters for constructive ideas and other contributions which produced savings to the Government of $25 million. These outstanding results demonstrate the interest and abilities of those in the public service of our Nation.
The need is great to continue to reduce Federal spending and to conserve energy and other vital resources. Because civilian and military personnel can help meet this urgent need, I am extending the cost reduction campaign through May 5, 1976. Therefore, I ask that until that date you continue to inform me of contributions approved within the Federal Incentive Awards Program which have measurable benefits of $5,000 or higher. Further, I urge that agencies continue to use this program to encourage and to recognize cost saving and other significant achievements made by Federal personnel.
