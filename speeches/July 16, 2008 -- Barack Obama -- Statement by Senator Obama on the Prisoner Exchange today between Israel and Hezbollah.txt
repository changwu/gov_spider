    Chicago, IL -- "Today the people of Israel received confirmation of the deaths of two of their bravest sons, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. Since their capture by Hezbollah terrorists in 2006, we have all held out the hope that they were still alive and would be coming home to their families, who campaigned so heroically across the world for their return. I was honored to meet last year with Ehud's wife Karnit and his mother Miki, who were visiting Washington on behalf of the Goldwasser, Regev, and Shalit families, and I offered them my hope and prayers and help. Today, Michelle and I offer the Goldwasser and Regev families, our deepest condolences on their loss, a tragedy no family should have to bear. In their time of extraordinary grief, an entire nation and friends throughout our country and around the world mourn with them. As they fought so hard for their loved ones' freedom, let us all reaffirm our commitment to win the freedom of the lone remaining Israeli solider held captive by terrorists, Gilad Shalit, so that his family can be spared this pain and welcome him back into their arms."
