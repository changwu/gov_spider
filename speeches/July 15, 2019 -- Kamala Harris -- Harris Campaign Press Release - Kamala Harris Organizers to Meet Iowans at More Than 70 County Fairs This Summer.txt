    This month, Kamala Harris' organizers are building on the campaign's outreach, meeting Iowans at events across the state, including at more than 70 county fairs. From Lyon County in the northwest to Lee County in the southeast and many in between, they will continue to harness Harris' momentum from the first Democratic Debate, meeting Iowans where they are. In many instances at these fairs, Harris staff will also partner with local Democratic county party groups to help support down-ballot candidates.
"We are organizing in every corner of this state to meet people where they are," said Harris' Iowa Organizing Director Erin Phillips. "Our team is going out into communities, listening, learning, and building the relationships with caucusgoers that are the foundation of our campaign."
With more than 65 paid staffers on the ground, almost all focused on organizing, the Harris operation is reaching into every county and precinct across Iowa. At county fairs, farmers markets, house parties, and more, organizers will engage Iowans in conversations about why Harris is the best person to take on Donald Trump and fight for them and their families. In addition to ensuring supporters fill out commit-to-caucus cards, the organizing team will help those interested in learning more about Harris stay in touch with the campaign.
Harris returns to Iowa on Tuesday, July 16, where she will host a roundtable about issues facing women of color with State Representative Phyllis Thede, LULAC Council 10 President Jazmin E. Newton-Butt, Davenport NAACP Vice President Vera Kelly and others, before joining AARP members and the Des Moines Register for a forum focused on older Americans and her solutions to problems that uniquely impact their lives.
