    Quinnipiac University published a new poll this morning that serves as a stark reminder for Republicans who want to win the White House that Governor Kasich is far and away the best candidate to carry Ohio in November.
From Quinnipiac:
"Gov. John Kasich is the strong favorite in November presidential matchups in Ohio, thumping former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 17 percentage points and burning Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont by 19 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.
Kasich tops Clinton 54 — 37 percent, including 57 — 27 percent among independent voters in Ohio, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll finds. The native son governor leads Sanders 54 — 35 percent, including 51 — 33 percent among independent voters.
Most other potential November matchups are too close to call."
