    Hillary and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the death of Representative Walter Capps. He was a rare soul, someone able to fuse intense spirituality with a devotion to his community and country. He brought constant values, a rare perspective, and a sense of moral grounding that public life too often lacks, and will sorely miss. I will always be grateful for his friendship and support. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Lois, his children Lisa, Todd, and Laura, who has worked with us at the White House, and their entire family.
