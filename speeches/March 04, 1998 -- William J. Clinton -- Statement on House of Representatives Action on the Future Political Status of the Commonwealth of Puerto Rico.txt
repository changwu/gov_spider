    I am pleased that the House of Representatives has passed a bill which establishes a process for determining the future political status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The bill does not impose onerous, unworkable, unprecedented, or unconstitutional language requirements on the citizens of Puerto Rico, unlike some proposals that were advanced in Congress.
I have always called for enabling Puerto Ricans to choose among options available for their future: continuing the Commonwealth arrangement, independence, or statehoodâ€”whatever future decided by majority choice. The House action is a victory for democracy and against exclusion. It is consistent with our country's repeated commitment to Puerto Rican selfdetermination, and consistent with the pride all Americans can take in the contributions those of Hispanic descent have made to all America.
