    I congratulate Sitiveni Rabuka on becoming the new Prime Minister of Fiji. As close partners, Fiji and the United States work together to advance an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, and secure. Together, we have also made progress on key challenges, including promoting sustainable economic recovery, tackling climate change, and curbing illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. In the years ahead, I look forward to continuing to strengthen the bonds between our people and advance our shared vision for a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
