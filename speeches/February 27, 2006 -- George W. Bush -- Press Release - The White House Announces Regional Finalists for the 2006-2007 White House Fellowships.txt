    The White House today announced that 106 outstanding men and women from across the country have been selected as Regional Finalists for the White House Fellows Program - the Nation's most prestigious program for leadership and public service. The Regional Finalists represent a broad cross-section of professions, such as business, education, health care, state government, engineering, law, non-profit, and technology. Additionally, four branches of the military are represented among the Regional Finalists. A complete list of the Regional Finalists is attached below.
During March and April 2006, Regional Finalists will participate in a rigorous interview process before citizen panels across the country. Based on the results of the interviews, approximately thirty candidates will be named National Finalists. The President's Commission on White House Fellowships will interview the National Finalists in June 2006. Based on these interviews, the Commission then will recommend between eleven and nineteen outstanding candidates to President George W. Bush for a one-year appointment as a White House Fellow.
The White House Fellows Program was founded in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This non-partisan program offers exceptional young men and women first-hand experience working at the highest levels of the Federal government. Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with renowned leaders from the private and public sectors. Following the Fellowship year, Fellows are expected to repay the privilege by contributing to the Nation as better leaders and public servants.
Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on a record of remarkable professional achievement early in one's career, evidence of leadership potential, a proven commitment to public service, and the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute successfully at the highest levels of the Federal government. In its 40 year history, the program has fostered leaders in many fields including Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, United Nations Foundation President and Former U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, and U.S. Senator Samuel Brownback.
