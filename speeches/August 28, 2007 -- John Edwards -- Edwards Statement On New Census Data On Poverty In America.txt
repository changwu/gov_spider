    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement regarding the data released today from the U.S. Census Bureau's Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division.
"The reality that we have two Americas was confirmed again today by new data from the Census Bureau. These statistics show what most Americans know: tens of millions of our fellow citizens are completely left out of the economic progress enjoyed by the individuals and corporations on the very top.
"With an increase in Americans without health insurance by two million to 47 million, nearly 37 million Americans still living in poverty and continued high levels of inequality, the need for fundamental change in our government is obvious.
"We simply cannot stand by while tens of millions of our fellow citizens go without the necessities of life. We need truly universal health care and a national effort to eliminate poverty. But neither of these basic steps to building One America is possible without bringing fundamental change to Washington."
According to Census Bureau data released today, the number of people without health insurance rose from 45 million in 2005 to 47 million to 2006. The number of Americans in poverty remained statistically unchanged at about 37 million. Median household income increased by 1.1 percent after inflation to $48,200.
