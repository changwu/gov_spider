Travel pool #3/arrival at college 
The president arrived at Germanna Community College in Culpeper, Va., at 11:57am.
Very few onlookers at a gas station outside the small Culpeper Regional Airport and along the rural US29 route.
Motorcade passed a Trump flag and sign that read "We fear God, not Covid" just after leaving the airport.
Near the college, though, a couple dozen protesters.
"Get your grubby hands off my healthcare" and "FJB" were among the signs. Also "Build Crack Better" and a long one that said "We won't forget what you stole: Jobs, Freedoms, History, Elections, Our Future," held by a bearded man whose bicep tattoo was mostly hidden by the short sleeve of his red Make America Great Again T-shirt.
At least one man was shouting "Let's Go Brandon" as we passed. That message was on several signs, too.
One man held a large "Joe Biden Sucks" flag. Poolers spotted a girl of about 7 holding a "Don't sniff me" hand drawn sign next to a woman, presumably mom, holding a "Biden Sucks" sign.
A number of red Youngkin for governor signs were planted at the protest corner.
Culpeper was the site of about a hundred Civil War battles and we passed a few signs related to historical sites en route.
Pool holding along with non-poolers awaiting the President. Stage set with signs that read "Build Back Better" and "Lowering Costs for Families."
Connectivity isn't super.

travel pool #5/Spanberger gaggle and Biden speaking
President Biden just started to speak, after Shannon Davis and her 12-year-old son, Joshua Davis, spoke about the high cost of Joshua's insulin. He's a 7th grader. "I live a very active life and don't let Type 1 slow me down." His diabetes was diagnosed when he was 11 months old.
"I am thankful that insulin was invented... Thank you so much to Congresswoman Spanberger and President Biden for all they're doing to make sure I will be able to continue to live safely and actively with affordable insulin," Joshua said.
The president marveled at the boy's poise.
"I could no more have done that when I was 12 years old than fly," Biden said, noting his childhood stutter. "I want you to know that lowering the cost of prescription drugs is one of the reasons why I'm here with your congressman."
Before the program started, pool chatted briefly with Rep. Abigail Spanberger at Germanna Community College in Culpeper. This area is in both the old and new versions of her district, VA-7.
What does it mean for Biden to come to her district:
Spanberger: "I'm just pleased to have the opportunity to have so many constituents speak with the President, take some pictures and share their stories. …It's important that they be able to tell the stories directly."
Some Dems don't want to be seen with Biden but you're here: Spanberger emphasized this isn't a campaign event.
Spanberger: "I am representing my community…. I have the opportunity to literally give my constituents the opportunity to tell their stories to the president United States. That's, for me, the height of what representation can and should be."
How concerned are you about the inflation news out today and broadly about prices weighing down on families?
Spanberger: "That's part and parcel of what we're here talking about. Right? So when you're worried about the gas pump or you're worried about the cost of chicken in the grocery store, and your child is diabetic -- all those things become impactful." Those are issues that matter ever day "to particularly the people who are here today."
Dems are in control during this stubborn inflation, does that make you more vulnerable?
Spanberger: "It's fair to say that we should be focused on addressing all the issues that matter to people and certainly, the laundry list of concerns that people bring to me as a representative includes inflation." The American Rescue Plan delivered billions to small businesses "so they wouldn't close their doors, so people could remain employed…. Virginia received more than $2.1 billion directly to school districts…. Then you look at the infrastructure bill" and provisions to help truckers and expand hours at ports of entry. "There's not one singular cause of inflation. There's not going to be one singular solution."

travel pool #6/Biden event ends 
The president's remarks in Culpeper, Va., just ended.
correcting a quote from report #5 from Rep. Abigail Spanberger: "of the" was dropped in the phrase "president of the United States."
"I am representing my community…. I have the opportunity to literally give my constituents the opportunity to tell their stories to the president of the United States. That's, for me, the height of what representation can and should be."

pool report #7/Lester Holt interview 
President Biden is currently doing an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt at Germanna Community College in Culpeper, Va.
The pool remains in the space used for the event listening to light jazz, uploading photos etc.

Per NBC: "This marks President Biden's first sit-down interview of 2022 and his first since marking one year in office."



February 10, 202214:53

pool report #8/depart Culpeper college 
The interview with NBC's Lester Holt ended--not that the pool saw any of it--and President Biden returned to the Beast.
The motorcade rolled from Germanna Community College in Culpeper, Va., at 2:52 pm en route Culpeper Regional Airport in Brandy Station, Va.



February 10, 202215:12

Travel pool #9/depart Culpeper 
Uneventful motorcade from Germanna Community College to Culpeper Regional Airport, past a sign indicating we are 65 miles from Washington. Came to a stop at 3:09p.
Spotted a sign along the highway near the airport that read Farmers for Trump, with a pasture on the far side of the fence and maybe a dozen cattle.
The anti-Biden protesters near the college were gone. No signs or venom in sight.
Two women we didn't see on the way in were stationed on a nearby corner holding handmade signs that read "We (heart) Joe" and "Culpeper (heart) Biden."
A few dozen people offered friendly waves from roadside near the airport.
Pool Osprey is some 200 yards from Marine One and we did not see POTUS board. Rotors rotating at 3:12.

You will find below the list of the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats who engaged with the press after their meeting at the White House. Senator Dianne Feinstein could not attend the meeting, and Senator Cory Booker was there, but did not come over to the stakeout location.
