    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee today announced that Senator David Vitter will serve as the Southern Regional Chair. Senator Vitter will help lead the campaign's efforts to build support in the south and in the United States Senate.
In announcing his endorsement, Senator David Vitter touted Giuliani's leadership and reputation as a proven problem-solver. "Rudy Giuliani has the strong, unwavering leadership and sound judgment we need in this time of war and terrorist threat. His performance under the extreme pressure of September 11th proves he is the determined leader our country needs to face today's challenges head-on."
"I believe the Republican Party needs to always be the party of free market economics and reform. Rudy implemented those principles as Mayor of New York by cutting taxes 23 times, making government more efficient and moving welfare recipients into jobs. It's exactly the kind of conservative reform the federal government needs," Vitter concluded.
"David Vitter is a good man â€“ a conservative reformer in the Senate who has fought for free market economic policy, ethics reform and much more," Mayor Giuliani said. "I am honored to have David join our team and lead our campaign efforts in the South and in the United States Senate," said Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
