    Barbara and I extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of the victims of Flight 232. Our hearts -- indeed, the hearts of all Americans -- go out to them in their time of sorrow.
I am sure I speak for many when I commend the extraordinary efforts of the airport personnel, rescue teams, National Guardsmen, and local citizens who rushed to the crash scene to offer aid. The compassion and generosity demonstrated by the entire Sioux City community in the wake of this catastrophe has been overwhelming.
Today we pray for the passengers killed on Flight 232. Let us also ask God to bless their loved ones and those survivors who remain hospitalized. May they find strength and comfort in their faith and in the love of family and friends.
