The Democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it....Retweets: 22852Favorites: 98873

In our Country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to Border Security and the Military the Democrats fight to the death.

Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the United States Military will build the Wall!Retweets: 23954Favorites: 98828

...sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation......Retweets: 20672Favorites: 80635

....In any event it goes on and on & the new AG who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda) does little else but rant rave & politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of 'justice.'Retweets: 17280Favorites: 72633
