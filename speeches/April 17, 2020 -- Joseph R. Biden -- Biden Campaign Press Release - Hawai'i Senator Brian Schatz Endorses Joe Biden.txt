    Today, Hawai'i Senator Brian Schatz announced his endorsement of Joe Biden. Senator Schatz joined former Governors George Ariyoshi, John Waihe'e, Ben Cayetano, and Neil Abercrombie and numerous other leaders across Hawai'i in endorsing Joe.
"We've seen how low they will go -- to take away our health care, to deny the climate crisis , to ignore experts and put us in danger," said Senator Brian Schatz. "Today I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden. Joe is the antidote our country needs. He will bring strong, steady leadership to the White House. He will unite the country. He will do the right thing. The people of Hawai'i will vote by mail on May 22. Let's go for Joe!"
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
The health and safety of our staff, supporters, and the general public is Biden for President's number one priority. During this pandemic, we are calling on all voters to follow social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19. Officials with the Hawai'i Democratic Party have issued precautions to ensure you can exercise your right to vote by holding a primary that is only vote-by-mail.
