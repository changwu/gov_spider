    IT IS with a profound sense of sorrow that the President learned today of the tragic death of John Paul Vann.
The President feels John Vann was one of America's finest citizens--and a truly extraordinary public servant. For more than a decade, he worked tirelessly in the forefront of our efforts to achieve an honorable peace in Southeast Asia and to bind up the wounds of its ravaged peoples. After his initial service as a military officer in Vietnam, he returned to that country to continue his devoted work as a civilian. There he has now given "the last full measure of devotion."
The President wants to say that, as honest and outspoken as he was committed, John Paul Vann did nothing in a half-hearted manner. For him, any work that was worth his undertaking was worth his very best--and that always meant a truly exceptional effort.
John Paul Vann will be deeply missed, by the people of Vietnam who came to know and love him, and also by his fellow Americans who have taken such pride in his contributions. His fervent dedication to peace and freedom will be a continuing inspiration to all of us.
On behalf of all Americans, the President and Mrs. Nixon extend to Mr. Vann's family and friends their deepest sympathy.
