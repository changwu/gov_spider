    I am deeply saddened by the loss of five U.S. Army personnel in southern Colombia, who perished in the crash of a U.S. military aircraft providing reconnaissance support for combined U.S.-Colombian counterdrug operations against illicit traffickers. Also lost in this tragedy were two Colombian military personnel.
Our thoughts and prayers are with our service members' families and friends as they cope with this tragic loss. These dedicated Americans and their Colombian comrades were engaged in the vital work of combating the drug trade, which threatens the welfare and security of both our nations.
We honor their commitment and remember their sacrifice as we intensify our efforts here in this country and around the world to counter the global drug problem.
