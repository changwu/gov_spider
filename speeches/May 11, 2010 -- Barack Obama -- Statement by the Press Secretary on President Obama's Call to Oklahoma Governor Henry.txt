    This afternoon, following a briefing from FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, President Obama called Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry. The President told Governor Henry that his thoughts and prayers were with the people of Oklahoma as they cope with the devastating damage caused by tornadoes and severe storms across the state, and that he wanted to make sure they were getting the support they need from the federal government. He assured the Governor that his Administration would respond swiftly to requests for federal assistance as the state works to rebuild and recover from the storms.
