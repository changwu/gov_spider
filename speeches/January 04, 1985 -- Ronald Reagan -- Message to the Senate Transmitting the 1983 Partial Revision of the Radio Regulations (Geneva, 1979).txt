    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the 1983 Partial Revision of the Radio Regulations (Geneva, 1979) and a Final Protocol, signed on behalf of the United States at Geneva on March 18, 1983.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the 1983 Partial Revision.
The 1983 Revision constitutes a partial revision of the Radio Regulations (Geneva, 1979) to which the United States is a party. The primary purpose of the present revision is to update the existing Regulations to take into account introduction of advanced techniques for maritime mobile, distress and safety communications. The Revision is consistent with the proposals of and positions taken by the United States at the 1983 World Administrative Radio Conference for the Mobile Services of the International Telecommunication Union.
At the time of signature, the United States Delegation submitted a statement countering an unfounded political allegation of Cuba. The specific statement, with reason, is given in the report of the Department of State.
The 1983 Partial Revision of the Radio Regulations will enter into force on January 15, 1985 for Governments that, by that date, have notified the Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union of their approval thereof. I believe that the United States should become a party to the 1983 Partial Revision as soon as possible, and it is my hope that the Senate will take early action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
