    On behalf of the American people, I extend warm congratulations to President Yeltsin and to all the citizens of Russia on the successful completion of this vigorously contested Presidential election. Yesterday's historic vote underscores how far Russia's democratic development has progressed in just a few years. While the official results have not yet been announced, it is clear that President Yeltsin and reform have won a decisive victory.
The credit for Russia's remarkable achievements over the last 5 years in developing the institutions of democracy and a market economy goes to the citizens of Russia and to their leaders, in particular President Yeltsin. The Russian people, through their participation in the electoral process, have pronounced themselves firmly in favor of the politics and economics of choice.
From the outset of my administration, the United States has been steadfast in its support of political and economic reform in Russia. We renew that commitment today as the Russian people move to consolidate these gains and complete Russia's integration with the global community. Few could have imagined the profound changes in Russia that we have seen since 1991. The changes are testimony not only to the progress that has been achieved, but to what the future can bring.
