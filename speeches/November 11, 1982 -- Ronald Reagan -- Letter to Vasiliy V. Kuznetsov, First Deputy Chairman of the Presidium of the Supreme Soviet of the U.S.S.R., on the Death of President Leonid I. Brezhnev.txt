    Please accept my condolences on the death of President Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev. President Brezhnev was one of the world's most important figures for nearly two decades. May 1 ask you to convey our sympathies to the President's family.
I would also like to convey through you to the Soviet Government and people the strong desire of the United States to work toward an improved relationship with the Soviet Union. I look forward to conducting relations with the new leadership in the Soviet Union with the aim of expanding the areas where our two nations can cooperate to mutual advantage.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
