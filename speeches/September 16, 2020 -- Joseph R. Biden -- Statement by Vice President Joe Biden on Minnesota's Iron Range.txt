    Minnesota's Iron Range has played a vital role in helping build America. U.S. manufacturing and mining was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II. It must be part of the Arsenal of American Prosperity today, helping power an economic recovery for working families. We must recognize the contribution of union members who helped build decades of growth in our country. That's why I'm proud to be endorsed by Iron Range unions across the labor movement — from the United Steelworkers to the AFL-CIO — and to stand with organized labor.
Despite the economic recovery set in motion by the Obama-Biden Administration across the Iron Range, under President Trump, demand for Iron Range products has suffered. Steel shipments are down more than 25% nationwide from last year, mining operations have idled, and thousands of Rangers have lost their jobs, all while China produced the largest monthly volume of steel on record. My Build Back Better plan creates millions of high-paying union jobs manufacturing and building new autos, bridges, water systems, transportation options, and more. My plan will make a historic procurement effort and reshore critical supply chains. Iron Rangers and other American workers will mine and manufacture the materials — including steel — to power that effort. Together, with real authentic leadership, we will put the U.S. on a path to lead the world's economy, and we will build back better.
