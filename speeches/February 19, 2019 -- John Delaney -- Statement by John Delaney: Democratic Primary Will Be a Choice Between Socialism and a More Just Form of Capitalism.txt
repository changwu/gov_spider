    DES MOINES, IA â€“ Campaigning today in central Iowa, John Delaney releases the following statement:
"By any measure, we are going to have a very strong field of candidates running and that's good for the country and good for the Democratic Party. Democrats are actually pretty united on our policy goals: we want everyone to have health care, we want everyone of every background to have a chance to live the American Dream, and we know that we have to act on climate change. The debate before us is how we get there.
"This primary is going to be a choice between socialism and a more just form of capitalism.
"I believe in capitalism, the free markets, and the private economy. I don't believe socialism is the answer and I don't believe it's what the American people want. I don't believe top-down, government-only approaches are the right answer. But I do believe in a clear role for government in creating institutions and policies that ensure equality of opportunity and basic human dignity.
"What the American people do want is a capitalism that is more just and more inclusive. They want to see entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth in their hometowns, not just in a few cities. They want to see more people have a chance to succeed and they want to see more fairness in the system. That's what my campaign is about - fixing our broken tax, health care, fiscal, and educational policies to ensure equality of opportunity and dignity for every American."
