    Mitt Romney today announced the support of the Chairman of the American Conservative Union Al Cardenas.
"I'm extraordinarily honored to earn Al's support," said Mitt Romney. "Al has been a force in the conservative movement for many years. There are few people I know that share a deeper belief in the principles of smaller government and American exceptionalism than him. I look forward to his counsel in the months to come as we look to restore America's promise."
Announcing his support, ACU Chairman Al Cardenas said, "Throughout this campaign I have heard from many candidates on how they are uniquely qualified to get our country back on track. While I am proud of all of them, I know that one man stands head and shoulders above the rest. That man is Mitt Romney. I have seen him up close for many years and I know he is the conservative we need to lead our country. Throughout his life, he has shown proven experience in job creation, balancing budgets, and turning around troubled enterprises. I'm also quite proud of his vision for the future that he has outlined, including his plan for more jobs, lower taxes, and less government. America needs Mitt Romney and I am pleased to stand with him."
