    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit for your consideration and enactment the "Comprehensive Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1989." This legislative proposal would implement the reforms I announced earlier this summer. It represents comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation designed to reduce substantially the power of special economic interests while enhancing the role of individuals and political parties. The proposal also restores competition to congressional elections by reducing the advantages of incumbency.
I look forward to working with the Congress on those critical issues.
George Bush
The White House,
September 26, 1989.
