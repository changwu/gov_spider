    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement recognizing National HIV Testing Day:
"AIDS is a national and international tragedy. An important step is to improve the awareness of people of their HIV status. Yet, right now, as many as 250,000 people in the United States may have HIV and not know it. National HIV Testing Day is an important reminder of how precious life is, the need to know your HIV status, and the opportunity to build a healthier and more productive future."
