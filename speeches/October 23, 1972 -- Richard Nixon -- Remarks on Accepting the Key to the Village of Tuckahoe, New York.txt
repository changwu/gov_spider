    Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mayor:
I wish to express my very grateful appreciation to you for presenting this key to me. In the many years that I have traveled to 80 countries abroad and every one of the 50 States and literally thousands of towns and cities, I must say that I have perhaps over a thousand keys to cities in America and around the world.
But I want you to know this: Because of the warmth of the welcome we had today, from young and old, from people all over this village, this key from the village of Tuckshoe will mean more than, I think, almost any of them.
I just want to say that several people have said "Good luck in the election," and in return, I want to say good luck to the Tuckshoe Tigers in their next game.
MAYOR ROBERT D'AGOSTINO. Mr. President, one more thing before you go. In this corner is Tuckahoe's urban renewal project. With your help these last 5 years, we are rebuilding our small but adequate village, thanks to you.
THE PRESIDENT. With revenue sharing, you can do even more. Thank you.
