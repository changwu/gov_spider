    Today, as Vice President Mike Pence travels to Tucson and Mesa, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Arizonans aren't better off or safer today than they were four years ago. President Trump and Vice President Pence ignored experts and failed to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control. More than 187,000 Arizonans have been infected, and more than three hundred thousand Arizonans are out of work as a result. Now, as our kids and educators head back to school, President Trump and Vice President Pence have again failed by not offering a concrete plan for a safe reopening, risking the safety of Arizona families. Trump and Pence failed Arizonans when they needed Presidential leadership the most. Joe Biden has led our country during a crisis before and has a clear road map on how we can get the coronavirus under control."
