    ARLINGTON, VA-- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Attorney General Bob McDonnell, Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling and two dozen Richmond-area small business owners endorsed John McCain's economic plan, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's "Jobs for America" plan to grow the economy as president.
"I strongly support Senator McCain's Jobs for America plan," said Virginia Lieutenant Governor and businessman Bill Bolling. "This plan will bring a much-needed shot in the arm to the national economy and help small businesses in Virginia, which are an economic engine for the Commonwealth."
More than two dozen small business leaders gathered at the Capital Interior Contractors, Inc. in Richmond today at a press conference to announce their support for Senator McCain's jobs-first economic plan, which the Senator unveiled today in Colorado.
Small business owner, and Democrat, Christy Swanson, said, "I am a Democrat, and I believe that with his Jobs for America economic plan, John McCain has once again shown that he is the strongest ally to America's small business owners. He understands the difficulties we face and the important role we play in the Virginia's economy. While I am a Democrat, I am proud to support John McCain for president and look forward to helping him to victory in November."
John McCain will continue to highlight his Jobs for America economic plan throughout the week, with stops in Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
