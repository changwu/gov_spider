    The President. You know, when you come, it reminds us of the responsibilities that we have in life. And Vivienne is lucky to have a mother and dad who will love her all the time. And she doesn't know it, yet, but she's learning pretty quickly. She's less than 24 hours old.
We also have a responsibility to make sure our education systems provide excellence for every child.
We have a responsibility—and Congress needs to bring me a bill that will help the patients who come to these hospitals maintain reasonable insurance, and a bill that doesn't help lawyers.
We have a responsibility to encourage love all throughout our communities. That's why the Faith-Based Initiative is so important. A lot of babies are born sometimes where the—some babies are born where people just don't love them like they should. And as a society, we've got to make up for that love. Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with service organizations all across—representing people from all across the country, committed to finding a million mentors to love children.
The good news for this little baby is, she's got a mom and dad who know their responsibilities. It's a great Fourth of July gift. Congratulations.
Okay.
