    Boston, MA – Romney Campaign Economic Adviser Glenn Hubbard made the following statement on the third quarter GDP report:
"With less than two weeks until the election, our economy is still mired in sluggish growth that's not raising family incomes or creating the jobs millions of unemployed Americans need. The President has had four years to make his policies work. By any measure, the economic record has been a disappointment. But this disappointment is not baked in the cake – we can do better. Mitt Romney has the plan and the experience to get our economy growing vigorously again and to create 12 million new jobs. That's the kind of change this country needs now."
