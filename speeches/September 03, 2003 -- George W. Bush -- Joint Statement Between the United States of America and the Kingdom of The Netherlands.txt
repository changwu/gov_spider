    President Bush and Prime Minister Balkenende today agreed that progress in fighting the global tragedy of HIV/AIDS requires more and better coordination among donor and recipient governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector.
The United States and the Netherlands therefore agree to cooperate on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in countries in which both the United States and the Netherlands have significant activities, including countries that will receive special focus in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The plan will start in Rwanda and Ghana and may expand to Zambia, Ethiopia, and possibly Sudan once a peace agreement is signed.
The cooperation agreement will highlight political leadership and public-private partnerships, which are a focus of both the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Netherlands 2003 AIDS Action Plan.
This cooperation agreement is the first step of a joint initiative in which the United States and the Netherlands will seek to coordinate HIV/AIDS activities, strategies, and programs in African countries.
