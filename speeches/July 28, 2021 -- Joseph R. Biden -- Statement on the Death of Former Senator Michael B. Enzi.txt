    For twelve years, I had the privilege of serving with Mike Enzi in the United States Senate. While we sat on different sides of the aisle, I always saw him first as a public servant who conducted himself with decency, honor, and integrity.
The Eagle Scout and National Guardsman, the small-business owner and small-town mayor, the State legislator who became a U.S. Senator, Mike never forgot where he came from and never forgot the people of his beloved Wyoming who placed their trust in him election after election.
Jill and I are saddened to learn of his passing, and our prayers are with his wife Diana, their children and grandchildren, and his countless friends, colleagues, and staff.
