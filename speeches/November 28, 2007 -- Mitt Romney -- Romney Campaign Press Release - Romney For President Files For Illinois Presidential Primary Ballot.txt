Boston, MA –Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced his intent to participate in the Illinois Presidential Primary on February 5, 2008. Illinois Romney for President Chair, State Senator Dan Rutherford, delivered the petitions and forms necessary for Governor Romney to appear on the Illinois Presidential Primary Ballot at the Illinois State Board of Elections in Springfield.
In addition to filing nearly double the number of needed petition signatures for Governor Romney to appear on the ballot, Senator Rutherford filed petitions for the Illinois Romney for President Delegates and Alternates to appear in each of the state's 19 congressional districts. The full slate is listed below. Upon filing the documents, State Senator Rutherford released the following statement
"Governor Romney has built an impressive organization of support in Illinois because voters recognize he is the candidate with the experience, vision and values to lead our nation at this crucial point in our nation's history. Illinois Republicans agree that we must keep taxes low, cut government spending, reform healthcare, and strengthen families across the country. I am proud to Chair Governor Romney's Illinois campaign and I look forward to our continued work to build on the strong grassroots support for his campaign in the state."
