    Secretary Carlos Gutierrez today made the following statement on how President Obama's policies have been hostile to job creators:
"From day one of his presidency, Barack Obama's policies have been hostile to job creators and small businesses. Last month's jobs report confirms the punishing effects of those policies, particularly on Hispanic communities. In the last month alone, unemployment among Hispanics has skyrocketed from 10.3 percent to 11 percent. President Obama promised hope and change â€“ now he's just hoping to change the subject from his failed economic record. Mitt Romney will help unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of America's small businesses and job creators, and he will get our economy moving again."
