KELLY RIPA: "How do you go about creating jobs? I mean there is such a need; there is so much unemployment in this country. And you are a successful businessman, so how does that play into your plan to create jobs here in America?"
MITT ROMNEY: "Well first of all, you recognize that it's not government that makes the jobs, it's free people, starting enterprises, growing them, and hiring people. So you don't try and make government take over the job of creating jobs. But government can be a partner to create the conditions where the private sector grows and thrives. And there are really five things, I won't go through them in great detail, but there are five things that will ignite our economy. One is taking advantage of our energy resources. We've got a lot of it. Becoming energy independent for North America is going to create a lot of jobs. Two, trade. Opening up trade that works for us will put a lot of people to work. Three, we got to fix our schools. You can't have schools performing in the bottom third of the world and expect to be able to have the kind of jobs our kids need. Four, you've got to get America on track to having a balanced budget. If entrepreneurs and businesses of all kinds think we're headed towards Greece, they're not going to invest in America and create jobs. And number five, you've got to recognize that jobs come from small business. We have to champion small business—help them grow and thrive."
