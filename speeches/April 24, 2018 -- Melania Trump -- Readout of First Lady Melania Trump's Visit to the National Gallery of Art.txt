    In tradition with State Visits, First Lady Melania Trump hosted Mrs. Macron for a spousal event, choosing to visit the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. this morning. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Macron were met by Frank Kelly, Deputy Director of the museum. The tour of the National Gallery of Art was crafted to particularly note the incredible work of French artists to complement the long-standing friendship between the United States and France.
"Everyone understands the language of art," said Mrs. Trump. "The historically famous and beautiful works that currently live in the National Gallery of Art are breathtaking."
Upon arrival, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. walked through the East Garden Court, admiring the sculptures originally created for a grove on the grounds of Versailles called the Théâtre d'Eau.
Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Macron first visited the traveling exhibit of the Cézanne Portraits in honor of Mrs. Trump's guest, Mrs. Macron.
"Paul Cézanne's work is a celebration," said Mrs. Trump. "It was perfect timing to have these exquisite paintings in Washington while Mrs. Macron was in town."
The tour also included a stop in the impressionist galleries where Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Macron stopped to admire the work of female American artist, Mary Cassatt, who worked among French impressionists in Paris during the 19th century. The pair made a final stop to Leonardo da Vinci's "Ginevra de' Benci"—the only painting by him in the Americas.
