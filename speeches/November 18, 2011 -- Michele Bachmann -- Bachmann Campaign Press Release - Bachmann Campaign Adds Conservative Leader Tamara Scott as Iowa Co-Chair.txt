    Urbandale, Iowa — Bachmann for President Iowa Campaign Manager Eric Woolson proudly announces the addition of conservative leader Tamara Scott as Iowa Co-Chair. Scott joins Chairman Kent Sorenson and Co-Chairman Brad Zaun in leading the growing team working to spread the message of Bachmann's constitutional conservative values.
"This is the most crucial election we face as a nation and I wanted to support a leader who most closely resembled the values of our founding fathers," Scott said. "Even in the face of adversity, Michele has proven she has the strength and tenacity to do what's necessary to lead this nation."
Scott serves as the Iowa Director for Concerned Women for America, a national grassroots public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. She previously served as the CWA Legislative Liaison, lobbying at the Iowa Statehouse. Ms. Scott serves on the Warren County Economic Development Corporation Education Foundation and the US Commission on Civil Rights — Iowa State Advisory Committee. In 2007, Ms. Scott was listed as one of the Top Ten influential King Makers by Religion News Service.
"We are proud to have the support of an honorable conservative leader like Tamara," Woolson said. "Tamara understands the critical time we are in and the importance of getting behind a candidate like Michele Bachmann, who is the only candidate who has been consistent on key conservative issues."
