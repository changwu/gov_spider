For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country but can't because Dems are blocking them some for two years-historic record. Passed committees but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!Retweets: 32078Favorites: 127500

Here we go with Mitt Romney but so fast! Question will be is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!Retweets: 36818Favorites: 175756

Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!Retweets: 28559Favorites: 128491
