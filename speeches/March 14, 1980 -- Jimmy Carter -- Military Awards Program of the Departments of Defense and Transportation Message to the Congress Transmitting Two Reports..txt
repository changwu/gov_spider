Of the 82,813 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel (including Coast Guard military personnel) during Fiscal Year 1979, 13,001 were adopted. Cash awards totalling $962,305 were paid for adopted suggestions during Fiscal Year 1979. These awards were based not only on tangible first-year benefits of $55,683,093 during Fiscal Year 1979 realized from adopted suggestions, but also on many additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature.
Enlisted personnel received $776,780 in awards during Fiscal Year 1979 representing 81% of the total cash awards paid during these periods.
