    I WOULD like to express my satisfaction with the outcome of the international energy conference which has just been meeting in Washington. The United States has approached the energy problem in a spirit of cooperativeness--among consumers and between consumers and producers--and I am pleased that this attitude struck a responsive chord with the participants of the Washington Conference. I believe that we are now well launched on an international effort to deal with all aspects of the problem. At the same time, this is only a beginning, and all the nations concerned must now pool their efforts and their ingenuity in the following up of the work of the conference. The United States is ready to do so and looks forward to working with all the other countries involved.
