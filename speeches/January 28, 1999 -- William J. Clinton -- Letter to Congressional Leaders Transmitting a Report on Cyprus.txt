    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period October 1 to November 30, 1998. The previous submission covered events during August and September 1998.
Following United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's September 30 announcement of an initiative to reduce tensions and promote progress towards a just and lasting settlement, the United Nations launched shuttle talks between both communities in October. During the reporting period, U.S. officials urged the leaders of both Cypriot communities to support fully the U.N. initiative. They also underscored my Administration's commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the Cyprus dispute based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
