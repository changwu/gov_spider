    In response to President Trump's meandering and erratic statement on the grounds of the White House today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Today's statement that was ostensibly supposed to be about China, but there was one topic that President Trump couldn't seem to get off his mind: Joe Biden, whose name the President invoked nearly 30 times. The whole sad affair says more about Donald Trump than he said about any particular topic.
"What we heard in the Rose Garden today wasn't a president at all. It was a politician who sees his re-election slipping away from him and who is furious that his own botched response to the coronavirus pandemic has denied him the campaign events he so craves. The American taxpayer should be reimbursed for the abuse of funds this spectacle represented.
"This shouldn't distract from the fact that the American people did hear from a real leader today. He spoke a few hours earlier in Wilmington about how we can build this country back better than we were before this crisis. He offered the American people a positive, inspiring vision for our future where we don't have to choose between confronting our existential climate crisis and creating millions of good paying, union jobs at the same time.
"Donald Trump made clear over the course of 63 minutes this afternoon just how badly that leadership is lacking and needed."
