    23 Iowa Activists and Elected Officials Add to One of the Largest Coalitions of Support for Any 2020 Presidential Campaign
Des Moines, IA - After a highly successful four-day swing through the state of Iowa on his "Lead with Love" tour, Cory Booker has locked in 23 new key endorsements that will help propel his campaign to victory on caucus night, including Johnson County Supervisor Royceann Porter, mental health activists Leslie and Scott Carpenter, Polk County Soil and Water Commissioner Lou McDonald, and Dubuque elected official Danny Sprank.
"We are so excited to have these incredible leaders and community activists in our corner on caucus night," said Cory 2020 Iowa State Director Mike Frosolone. "We've seen on the ground and in polls throughout this process that the more people get to know Cory Booker, the more they like him and sign up to caucus for him - and it's happening now more than ever in the final stretch of this campaign. We are going to keep building towards caucus night brick by brick, and this group of new endorsements represents a lot of bricks."
Johnson County Supervisory Royceann Porter, who made history as the first black woman to hold county-wide office in Johnson County,was so moved by Cory's latest stop in Iowa City that she endorsed him right there on the spot, saying:

Leslie and Scott Carpenter, the founders of Iowa Mental Health Advocacy, soon followed suit at the same event. Scott later penned an article for Bleeding Heartland, saying:
"If you go to a campaign event for Senator Booker, you'll see that he's a man of deep moral purpose. Not only does he have a passion for helping others, he has made it his life's mission."
These 23 Iowans join 84 Iowa elected officials and activists in supporting Cory Booker, adding to one of the largest coalitions of support for any 2020 presidential campaign.
