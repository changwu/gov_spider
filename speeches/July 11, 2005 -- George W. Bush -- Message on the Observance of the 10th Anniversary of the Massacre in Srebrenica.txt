    On July 11, we remember the tragic loss of lives in Srebrenica ten years ago. The mass murder of nearly eight thousand men and boys was Europe's worst massacre of civilians since World War II and a grim reminder that there are evil people who will kill the innocent without conscience or mercy. This horrific event remains a source of pain for people in the Balkan region and for all those who believe in freedom and the dignity of human life. I join all Americans in sending our deepest condolences and expressions of sympathy on this solemn occasion.
The United States supports the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the families of those who suffered as they commemorate this terrible chapter in history. We grieve for their loss and applaud the strength and courage of those who have returned to Srebrenica to rebuild their lives. We also remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for these crimes face justice, most notably Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
I appreciate all the individuals who are advancing reconciliation and a strong European future for Bosnia and Herzegovina. A modern and democratic Balkan region is an essential element in a Europe that is unified, free, and at peace. As we work to make the world more peaceful, we share a common faith in the value of freedom, the sanctity of life, and the triumph of good over evil.
May God bless the people of the Balkan region and the souls of the departed.
