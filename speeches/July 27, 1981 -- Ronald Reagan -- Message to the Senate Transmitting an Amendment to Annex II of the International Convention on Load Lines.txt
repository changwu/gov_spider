    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to acceptance, an amendment to regulation 49(4)(b) of Annex II of the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966. The report of the Department of State is also transmitted for the information of the Senate in connection with its consideration of this amendment.
The International Convention on Load Lines established uniform principles governing the safe loading of ships on international voyages. The annexes, which form an integral part of the Convention, embody the regulations for determining the location of ships' load lines and divide the world's oceans into regions in which particular load lines must be observed depending upon the season of the year in which they operate. The amendment to regulation 49(4)(b) of the Convention, which was proposed by the Government of Australia, would redefine the seasonal tropical area in the South Indian Ocean to include waters in the new offshore oil development area off the northwest coast of Australia.
I believe that the proposed amendment will not be detrimental to American shipping and should be accepted. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this amendment.
