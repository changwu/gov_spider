    To the Congress of the United States:
Natural gas has become the Nation's scarcest and most desired fuel. It is in our interest to bring the reserves in Alaska to market at the lowest possible price. Consequently, I am today sending the Congress my decision and report on an Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System.
The selection of the Alcan project was made after an exhaustive review required by the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 determined that the Alcan Pipeline System will deliver more natural gas at less cost to a greater number of Americans than any other proposed transportation system.
The Alcan proposal, taken together with the recently signed Agreement on Principles with Canada, demonstrates that our two countries working together can transport more energy more efficiently than either of us could transport alone.
Unnecessary delay would greatly increase the total cost of the pipeline system. I urge the Congress to act expeditiously to approve this important project.
