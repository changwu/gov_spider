    The President. Welcome. Thank you for coming. Laura and I are thrilled you're here. Vice President and Lynne Cheney are happy you're here as well. This is a chance for us to thank the Members of Congress and their families for serving the United States of America. I hope you have found it as great a joy serving our country as we have. The South Lawn is full of anticipation and excitement. There's square dancing and trains and obviously balloon hats. [Laughter]
Audience member. It's a cowgirl hat.
The President. Cowgirl hat. Madam Speaker, thank you for coming. I'm—appreciate you bringing your family. Leaders of the House and the Senate, thanks for serving. I'm really thrilled to be able to introduce a friend of my family's—friends of my family for a long period of time. We're really lucky to have with us today the Oak Ridge Boys. I'm honored they are here.
Thank you all for coming. Please enjoy yourselves. May God bless you and your families. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you for coming.
