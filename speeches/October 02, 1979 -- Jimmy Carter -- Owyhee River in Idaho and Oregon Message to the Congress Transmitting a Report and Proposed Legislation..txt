    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith draft legislation to add two segments of the Owyhee River in Idaho and Oregon totalling 178 miles to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system. These segments would be administered by the Secretary of the Interior as units of the national system.
I also recommend that an additional 14-mile segment of the river be administered by the State of Oregon under its Scenic Waterways program.
These recommendations are based on the accompanying report prepared by the Secretary of the Interior under section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
