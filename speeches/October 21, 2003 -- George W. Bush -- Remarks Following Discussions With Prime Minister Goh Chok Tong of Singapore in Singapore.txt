    Mr. Prime Minister, thanks. It's so gracious of you to host us, and it's a chance for me to say to the Singapore people how much we appreciate our friendship. And I appreciate our personal relationship, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister is a wise man. He understands Southeast Asia very well. And a lot of our discussion was about how we continue to foster our agenda, which is one of peace and freedom as well as prosperity through trade.
I appreciate your good advice, and I want to thank you for your warm hospitality. It's a magnificent country you have here. We're honored to be here. Thank you again.
