    I could have shut up about life and marriage. Big money donors wanted me to shut up but I didn't. I lost their support but I didn't lose my soul.
I don't wake up each morning and wonder which Mike Huckabee I am going to be. I don't have two sets of views depending on who I am speaking to.
I am staunchly pro-life and pro-marriage. As President, I am not going to leave these issues up to the states. I am going to fight for federal laws to end abortion and protect traditional marriage. I will end Planned Parenthood's federal funding as fast as I am going to tear down the IRS with the FairTax.
If that's the kind of President you want in office then I urge you to get involved in my campaign today.
Knowing I have your support as we head into the final weeks before the Iowa caucus will make all of the difference in the world.
