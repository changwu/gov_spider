    Today, Kasich for America announced that Kerry Knott, former chief of staff to U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) and former senior director of government affairs at Microsoft, has joined the campaign team as Senior Policy Advisor, focusing on domestic policy development and policy communications.
As chief of staff to former Majority Leader Armey (R-TX) for 14 years, Knott led the development of the "Contract with America," the comprehensive conservative reform agenda which helped Republicans take back the U.S. House in 1994. During that time, he worked closely with then-Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich as Kasich led the effort to balance the federal budget for the first time in a generation.
Knott later led the congressional affairs teams at Microsoft as well as Comcast. More recently, Knott served as President of the C.S. Lewis Institute, which helps churches and pastors more effectively share their faith. Kerry is a graduate of Auburn University and lives in Arlington, Virginia with his wife and three children.
"From day one, Governor Kasich's mission and focus has been to develop pro-growth solutions that help every American rise and succeed. Kerry's extensive background as a leading policy advisor for lawmakers and in the private sector, as well as his background and good working relationship with the team, make him an incredible asset to the governor's team," said Beth Hansen, campaign manager for Ohio Governor John Kasich.
"Having worked closely with Gov. Kasich when he was leading the Budget Committee, I know his character, his commitment to conservative principles, and his willingness to push and enact big ideas. I'm grateful for the chance to be part of what he's doing and help him develop and communicate the ideas America needs to be strong and successful," Kerry said.
