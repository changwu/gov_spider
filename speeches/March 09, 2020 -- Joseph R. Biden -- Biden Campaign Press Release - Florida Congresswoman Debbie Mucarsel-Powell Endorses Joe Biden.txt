    Today, Florida Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell announced on CNN her endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Joe Biden will deliver on the priorities that South Florida cares deeply about," said Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. "My father was killed by a criminal with a gun, and like so many others in my community who have experienced gun violence, this is deeply personal to me. Joe took on the NRA - twice - and won, leading the fight to pass the Brady background check bill. I know Joe Biden will deliver the results we need, not only on gun violence, but on health care, the environment and foreign policy, because that's what he's been doing his whole life."
Murcasel-Powell joins more than 50 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, and current Members of Congress Kathy Castor, Charlie Crist, Val Demmings, Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Al Lawson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Darren Soto, and Frederica Wilson. Biden also has the most support from more Members of Congress of any candidate in the race, with more than 80 members backing him. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
Biden's endorsements showcase the diversity of support for Vice President Biden in Florida and across the country, as well as the trust that these leaders have in his ability to beat Donald Trump, restore the soul of this nation, rebuild the middle class, and bring the country together.
