    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Honorable Bob Bergland, Secretary of Agriculture, has agreed to serve again this year as Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area. Secretary Bergland did an outstanding job as campaign chairman last year and I am pleased that he is willing to serve again.
Citizens working together through voluntary agencies can become partners in the effort to build better communities, a healthier nation, and a more peaceful world. This year, our help is needed more than ever. Voluntary organizations need the support of all Federal personnel in the National Capital Area to accomplish their important objectives.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the combined campaign in your organization and that you appoint a top assistant as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Secretary Bergland of the person you designate as your Vice Chairman.
JIMMY CARTER
