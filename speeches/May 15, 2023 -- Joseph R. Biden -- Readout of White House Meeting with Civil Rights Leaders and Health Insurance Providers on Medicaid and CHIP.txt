    Last week, White House Director of the Office of Public Engagement and Senior Advisor to the President Steve Benjamin, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, and Deputy Assistant to the President for Health and Veterans Affairs Christen Linke Young convened a meeting with civil rights leaders and health insurance providers to discuss the Biden-Harris administration's ongoing efforts to lower health care costs and protect access to affordable health care for all Americans.
During the meeting, Biden-Harris administration officials and key stakeholders discussed how CMS, states, insurers, and community stakeholders are working together to ensure people remain connected to coverage as Medicaid redeterminations resume. They also discussed the catastrophic impact to Medicaid of adding additional bureaucratic red tape by imposing work reporting requirements, noting that states that have tried similar policies have seen nearly 1 in 4 people lose coverage.
Biden-Harris Administration officials concluded the meeting by with a commitment to continue working with civil rights leaders and key stakeholders to protect comprehensive health care coverage for all Americans.
