    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today regarding Peter King's amendment to the Homeland Security bill that is currently being debated in Congress:
"Last night, the leading Democratic candidates once again failed to even utter the words ‘Islamic terrorism' at their fourth debate.
"This morning, congressional Democrats are once again showing they just don't get the Terrorists' War on Us by attempting to strip important protections for those who report suspected terrorists on airlines.
"Peter King is doing the right thing by putting our national security first and political correctness run amok second.
"The terrorists are at war with us – whether or not Democrats in Washington and on the campaign trail choose to acknowledge it — and we must stay on offense to prevail."
