    Today I signed the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act into law. This legislation protects a stunning, 35-mile stretch of Lake Michigan's coastline as a wilderness area and guarantees public access for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor pursuits. It also marks the first time Congress has passed a public lands designation in 5 years, ending the longest period of congressional inaction on wilderness protection in nearly 50 years. And it passed with bipartisan support, proving that protecting America's natural beauty is something leaders from both parties can get behind.
Now it's up to Congress to do even more. There are currently dozens of conservation proposals before Congress, many supported by Democrats and Republicans, that would protect important lands across the country and help grow our economy. Congress should act on these proposals, and in the meantime, I will continue to do my part to protect our Federal lands for future generations to enjoy.
