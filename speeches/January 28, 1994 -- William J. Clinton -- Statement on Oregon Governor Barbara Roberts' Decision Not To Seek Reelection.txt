    It was with regret that I learned of Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts' decision not to seek reelection.
I have been very fortunate to work with the Governor on issues affecting the people of the Northwest and the Nation: health care, economic opportunity, and the protection of our natural resources. Her leadership on these and other issues will be missed.
I commend Governor Roberts for her dedication to the people of Oregon throughout her 20 years of public service. My best wishes go out to the Governor and her family.
