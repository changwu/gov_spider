This is a President that's now saying he should have 'told a better story' in his first two years as President....It's the worst thing I've ever observed and the American people obviously deserved a lot better than what we got today." — Sen.

SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "This is a President that said: if he couldn't get it done in four years—i.e., restore the economy—then he didn't deserve a second term. This is a President that's now saying he should have 'told a better story' in his first two years as President? What he really shouldn't have done is foist off Obamacare on the American people in the sleaziest process that I have ever seen in the United States Senate. You know the Cornhusker Kickback, the Louisiana Purchase. He said he wouldn't have any lobbyists in the White House? He didn't. He had them in the Blair House. It's the worst thing I've ever observed and the American people obviously deserved a lot better than what we got today."
