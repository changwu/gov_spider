    Q. Mr. President, now that you've seen it firsthand, what do you think?
The President. It's horrible. But I'm glad so many people lived, like these people here. They were in the—they got warning, so they went in the bathroom and lay down. They have two 8-year-old twins. They had their children with them. So they're all unhurt.
We've just got to make sure that they get— they have no livelihood here. And the important thing is that we move this assistance as quickly as we can to them.
Q. What assistance are you bringing today?
The President. We have all kinds of personal assistance, and we're also going to try to help them with the cleanup so they can get back to normal and also hire some people around here, while they're otherwise idle, to be part of the cleanup.
Q. What are you trying to say to these people? It's got to be so difficult to talk to people——
The President. I think the most important thing is that they—right now a lot of them are still almost in shock, but they're beginning to think—it's been a few days now—they're beginning to think about how they're going to live. And the important thing is that we work out all the practical problems of their lives right now—make sure everybody has got a place to live and food and income to live on—and then that we move all these claims through as quickly as possible and do everything we can to speed the process by which they can return to normal.
There is so much grief and frustration and loss. The most positive thing that can be done is just to get everybody focused on tomorrow. If they've all got something to look forward to tomorrow, some progress, no matter how halting, it's been my experience that that's the healthiest thing that can happen, that everybody—just start people focused on coming back. And so that's what we're trying to do.
