    The President. Admiral, thank you very much for your hospitality. You know, it's a great honor to come here. It's an honor to see the troops who've been wounded, and it's an honor to hug their families, and it's an honor to see the fabulous care that these folks receive. You know, our citizens wonder whether or not troops in harm's way will get superb medical care. And the answer is, absolutely, they get fantastic medical care.
Sometimes there's bureaucratic snafus that we're straightening out. But our citizens should never question whether or not the nurses and docs and caregivers are giving it their all in a professional way. They're saving lives, and they're healing hearts at the same time. And so it's a wonder what takes place here, admiral. And I want to thank you and the colonel for taking the lead. And you know, I'mâ€”I know Americans join me in praising our troops and honoring their families.
Merry Christmas to you.
Rear Adm. Richard R. Jeffries. Thank you, sir. It's an honor to serve them and you.
The President. Yes, sir. Thank you all. Thank you.
