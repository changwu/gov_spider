    The last time Democrats made this promise, millions of Americans lost their health plans anyway.
A year ago today, Joe Biden tried to defend his radical health care plan by telling voters "if you like your plan, your employer-based plan, you can keep it. In fact, if you have private insurance, you can keep it."
This was an audacious Lie of the Year when the Obama-Biden Administration used it to sell ObamaCare, and it's still a lie today. The public option championed by Joe Biden will kill the private insurance plans held by millions of Americans, a fact that President Obama himself acknowledged in 2009. Jonathan Gruber, the architect of ObamaCare who has now endorsed Joe Biden's health care plan, once authored multiple studies that confirmed government-run health insurance like the type Joe Biden is proposing drives people off of their private health plans.
It will get even worse: Bernie Sanders and the radical left successfully pushed Biden's health agenda "much further" to the left after they were done with it.
"If the Democrats are right and the public option is better, then it'll wipe out the private choice," Gruber once said. And of course, that's Democrats' real goal. "For people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it?" CNN's Jake Tapper asked Kamala Harris last year. "Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on," Harris responded.
Biden's plan also threatens to shut down many rural hospitals, which are often the largest employers for Americans who live in rural areas.
President Trump is the only candidate in the race who will actually protect the privately-held health plans of millions of Americans from the schemes of the radical left. While the Trump Administration already succeeded in enacting reforms to lower health premiums across the board, Joe Biden is campaigning on new health care taxes and a radical health care takeover that will cancel plans and cause premiums to skyrocket for middle class families.
