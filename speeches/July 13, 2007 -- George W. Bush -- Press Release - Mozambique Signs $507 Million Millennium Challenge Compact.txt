    The Republic of Mozambique signed a five-year, $507 million Compact today with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The United States congratulates the people and Government of Mozambique for reaching this important milestone and developing a comprehensive, results-oriented program focused on reducing poverty through economic growth. The compact seeks to help Mozambicans increase incomes and reduce chronic malnutrition by improving water, sanitation, roads, land tenure, and agricultural productivity. This program is expected to benefit approximately five million Mozambicans. The United States is proud to stand with the Mozambicans in their efforts to provide hope and opportunity for their citizens, and looks forward to building on our dynamic partnership as we implement this ambitious plan.
