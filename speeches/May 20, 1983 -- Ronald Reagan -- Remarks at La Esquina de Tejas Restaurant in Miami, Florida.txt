    Thank you all. Thank you all very much, and let me reassure you, I know that some of you will probably be present in a little while when I've got to make a speech, so I won't make two of them, or I won't make the one twice. [Laughter]
But I just want to say, again, this hospitality and the warmth of your greeting and all is a very heartfelt experience for me. I'm grateful to all of you. I'm also more full than I should be. [Laughter] But it was wonderful.
And I can't help but think, though, seriously, how much of the problem that's on all of our minds, how much of it is evident-there is a sermon or a speech in the menu, because is there anyplace in Cuba, outside of maybe the Presidential Palace, where that menu could still be served? [Applause]
Just before boarding the plane this morning I was handed a little report, and Cuba is not even able to meet its quota now for its customers in its principal crop, sugar. And I've been told since I've been here, they're importing that. And if ever there was an explanation of the difference between freedom and what they now have there, it's all told in what we've been eating here in the menu, because that's no longer available there.
And if I go on any longer, I will be making the speech that I'm going to make later. So, I better not do that. [Laughter] But thank you all very much. Thank you.
