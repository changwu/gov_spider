    To the Congress of the United States:
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add South Africa to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to South Africa.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
