    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Bilbray (D) Nevada)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2142, because it would designate nearly twice as much wilderness — 731,000 acres vs. 409,900 acres — as the Forest Service recommended as a result of its forest planning process. H.R. 2142 would also establish a new 29,000-acre Mount Rose National Recreation Area, compared to the administration's recommendation that 16,000 acres of this area be designated as wilderness. The excessive designations included in H.R. 2142 would reduce future timber sales receipts, opportunities for future mineral development, and associated payments to the State of Nevada. The bill would also unnecessarily restrict future land management options.
