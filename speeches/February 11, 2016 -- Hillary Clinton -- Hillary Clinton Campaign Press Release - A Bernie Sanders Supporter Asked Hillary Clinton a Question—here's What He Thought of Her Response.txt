On a cold Saturday in February, Hillary Clinton set up shop on a college campus. She invited students to ask her anything they wanted—whether they were planning to vote for her or not.
The first question came from Jack Lovell, a 17 year old wearing a Bernie Sanders campaign button. 
Jack: Now, that also surrounds you with a certain amount of distrust from the American people. What do you say to the people that hold this distrust, and how would you gain their trust?
Hillary: That's a very fair question.
Afterward, Jack described his experience coming into the event.


He came to the event because he wanted to see a different side of Hillary—and that's exactly what happened.



He summed up what he had seen, and how it changed his opinion of Hillary:
"Originally," Jack says, "I thought she was a regular politician who was going to talk about herself and defuse every question."
