    ALTHOUGH the Government has many programs that affect prices and costs including, of course, procurement--there is now no central mechanism for following their current operations to see whether they are being conducted, insofar as possible, in line with the need for reasonable stability of prices and costs. This newly established Committee will provide such a mechanism.
Each of the programs covered by this order operates under its own law and regulations, and each was set up for a specific purpose. What is needed today is a fresh look at how they are operating in the fight of modern-day economic problems. We need to make sure that we are not contributing to the Nation's inflationary problems by the way in which we run our own Government business.
