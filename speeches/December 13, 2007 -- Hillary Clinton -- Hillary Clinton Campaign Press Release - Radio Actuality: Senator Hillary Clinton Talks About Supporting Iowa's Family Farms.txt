Script:
"I understand the challenges that farmers and their families face in Iowa. But I also know that with the right policies in place, our nation's farms can thrive and can help America solve pressing problems, like providing a safe and healthy food supply, producing renewable energy, and creating vibrant rural communities and jobs. That is why I have made a strong commitment to supporting family farms. Today, I was proud to stand up for family farms by voting to limit commodity payments to $250,000 per farmer. As President, I will promote legislation that will help small farmers remain competitive in the face of a growing threat by corporate agriculture and vertical integration that dominate agricultural markets."
