    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Udall (D) Arizona)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 1549 as reported by the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. In addition, the Administration supports two provisions contained in the House Energy and Commerce Committee (HE&CC) version of H.R. 1549.
These provisions would: (1) prohibit NRC from transferring the operating license of the Long Island Lighting Company's Shoreham nuclear powerplant to a State agency for decommissioning; and (2) prevent NRC from holding more than one hearing on the combined construction permit/operating license for a nuclear powerplant.
The Administration, however, opposes a third HE&CC provision concerning the production of tritium. This provision would prohibit the production of tritium in licensed commercial nuclear powerplants for weapons purposes, except when Congress declares a state of war or national emergency. This prohibition would be an unwise limitation on. the President's flexibility to deal with any potential shortage of tritium.
