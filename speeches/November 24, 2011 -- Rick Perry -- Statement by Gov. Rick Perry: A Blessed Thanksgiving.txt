    We pause today to give thanks for the many blessings in our lives: the love of family, the sacrifices of our military, the freedoms of a great nation. We are thankful for the many people we have met as we have traveled our country this year, and the patriotism of that special breed called Americans. We will enjoy this Thanksgiving holiday as a family, enjoying time spent with loved ones. We wish you and yours a very blessed Thanksgiving.
God bless you, and God bless America.
