    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 1002 of Public Law 99 - 145 (22 U.S.C. 2592a), I am forwarding herewith the classified version of the Administration's report to the Congress on Soviet Noncompliance with Arms Control Agreements. Also enclosed is the unclassified version of the report.
This is the fifth in a series of reports on Soviet compliance with their international obligations. On the whole, our compliance policy has made progress since last year's report. The report notes certain constructive steps the Soviets have taken, such as the destruction of the radars illegally deployed at Gomel and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze's commitment to correct the Krasnoyarsk radar violation of the ABM Treaty. At the same time, the report details several issues that continue to concern the United States.
I intend to continue to press for scrupulous Soviet compliance with their arms control treaty obligations. The principle of scrupulous compliance is particularly important as we near completion of new arms control treaties.
I value the strong congressional support for our compliance policy to date, and look forward to working closely with the Congress on these issues in the future.
Sincerely,
George Bush
