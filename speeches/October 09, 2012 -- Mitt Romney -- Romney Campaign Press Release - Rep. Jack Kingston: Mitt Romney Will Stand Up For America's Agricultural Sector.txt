    Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for a vibrant rural America:
"I applaud Governor Romney's support of America's farmers and ranchers as they continue to ensure Americans have access to safe and affordable food. As someone who understands the private sector, Romney knows that family farms — like all small businesses — are struggling in the midst of the Obama economy, which has crushed them with higher taxes and job-killing regulations. We can't afford another four years like the last four years, and in a month, we will have the opportunity to take our country in a new direction. The choice is clear: Governor Romney is the candidate in this race who will stand with America's agriculture sector and get our economy back on track."
