    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after learning about the passing of Pramukh Swami Maharaj:
"Bill and I offer our sincerest condolences to the devotees of his Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj and the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha worldwide.
"Pramukh Swami didn't just teach virtues – he lived them every day. That's what made him a Guru to millions of devotees around the world. From the Akshardham Mandir in New Jersey to the countless temples that he blessed in the United States, Pramukh Swami built a global faith and community founded on Vedic values.
"Bill was fortunate enough to visit with his Holiness, both here in the United States and at the Akshardham Mandir in Gujarat. In meeting many of his followers, I've been touched by his wisdom as well.
"Pramukh Swami's deep sense of devotion led him to spend his life revitalizing communities in need. His worship of karma inspired him to promote peace and justice in India, America, and all around the world. His example helped his followers find more harmony – both with others, and within themselves. And we hope that humanity will build upon his legacy for generations to come.
"Jai Swaminarayan."
