A South Carolina voter asked Marco earlier today about growing the conservative movement and attracting African-American voters.

It's some of the most thoughtful, inspiring 10 minutes of persuasion you'll see anywhere in politics these days.
Conservatives across the country are praising Marco's answer.
This. This is how we win. I have never heard a Republican share this message so well and so sincerely. #TeamMarco https://t.co/7dYSieZonv

Marco's campaign is about a lot more than winning an election — it's about growing the conservative movement and the Republican Party. Marco will do that.
