    SALT LAKE CITY, Utah â€“ Bernie Sanders on Friday welcomed an endorsement from UNITE HERE Local 7, which represents 3,000 workers in the Baltimore, Maryland area. Local 7 is the sixth UNITE HERE local to endorse Sanders' bid for the White House.
"It is an honor to receive the endorsement of so many hospitality workers in Baltimore," Sanders said. "This campaign is building a movement of millions of Americans who are demanding that our economy works for everyone, not just the top 1 percent. The UNITE HERE Local 7 in Baltimore is an important part of this movement which is spreading to every corner of our country. I am grateful for their support."
"Bernie Sanders is talking about the things that we fight for every day," said Local 7 member Kareem Boyd who works at the Baltimore Convention Center and Camden Yards. "Good paying jobs, affordable health care, good education for all, equality and rights on the job. I think the more people know about Bernie the more they'll go his way."
Local 7's 3,000 members are food and cocktail servers, housekeepers, cooks, bartenders, bellmen, front desk agents, cashiers, dishwashers, casino and food service workers in Baltimore area hotels, universities, casinos, public venues and Thurgood Marshall BWI Airport.
"We live in a city where a young black man is more likely to end up in prison than in college," said Leila Butler, a slot attendant at Horseshoe Baltimore Casino. "I have two teenage sons and I worry all the time. There are big things that need to change. Bernie Sanders has a plan to stop investing in the mass incarceration of black men and start investing in jobs and education. I support that and I support him."
