    THE PRIME MINISTER of Australia met for an hour and a half at the White House this morning with the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. They continued the discussion of current problems at the United Nations which the President and Mr. Macmillan had started in New York on Tuesday last. They adjourned their meeting at 10:50 A.M.
All three were agreed in the hope that the General Assembly will now be able to achieve real progress on the problems confronting it, notably that of disarmament.
The United States and British Secretaries of State plan to meet again this afternoon at the British Embassy at 2:30 to carry forward the review of certain of the points under discussion this morning.
