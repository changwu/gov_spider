General Motors which was once the Giant of Detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?Retweets: 17115Favorites: 78736

The disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly I and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back?Retweets: 26349Favorites: 103591

The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky!Retweets: 15849Favorites: 68951

Bryan Dean Wright former CIA Officer(Dem): 'In 2016 we had a Coup. We have to take Comey and others to task. Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences.' @fox&FsRetweets: 18620Favorites: 60023

The Euro is dropping against the Dollar 'like crazy' giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage...and the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good doesn't it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.Retweets: 14577Favorites: 64907

....We don't have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players) we have a Fed problem. They don't have a clue!Retweets: 11776Favorites: 53818

If the Fed would cut we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time. Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!Retweets: 14180Favorites: 58890

The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One. https://t.co/z0iDj2L0Y3Retweets: 17704Favorites: 61464
