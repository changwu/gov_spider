    Longest Serving Member of Florida Congressional Delegation Backs Harris Ahead of First Debate in Miami
Senator Kamala Harris has earned her second endorsement this week from a member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Congressman Alcee Hastings, the longest serving member of Florida's congressional delegation, is backing Harris, saying she has "moral clarity" and "has delivered results for Americans at every level of government." Pointing to her efforts to help America's working families through policies like her LIFT Act and teacher pay proposal, he joins fellow CBC members Barbara Lee of California and Al Green of Texas in supporting Harris' candidacy.
"Kamala Harris is the right choice to lead our nation," said Hastings. "We live in historically troubling times and are in desperate need of leadership that exemplifies courage, conviction and moral clarity. Kamala has delivered results for the American people at every level of government and is ready to solve for the issues that especially impact communities of color including access to quality and affordable healthcare. As we look toward the future and seek a more perfect union, I feel it necessary to make my voice heard early in this process and look forward to working to elect her as the next President of the United States."
"Alcee is a career public servant and staunch voice for hardworking families and I'm proud to have his endorsement in this race," Harris said. "I'm glad that he is joining this people-powered campaign in our fight to restore truth and justice in America and to build an economy that works for everyone."
Hastings is the first elected official from the Sunshine State to endorse Harris. Harris and 19 other Democratic candidates will travel to Miami, Florida - just outside Hastings district - next week for the first Democratic debates. Florida will award more than 200 delegates in the 2020 Democratic primary.
