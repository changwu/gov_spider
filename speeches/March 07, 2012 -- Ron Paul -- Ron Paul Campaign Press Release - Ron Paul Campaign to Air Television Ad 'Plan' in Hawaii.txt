HONOLULU, Hawaii — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that it will air its 30-second television spot 'Plan' in Hawaii beginning tomorrow to solidify Dr. Paul's islands support base ahead of the Tuesday, March 13th caucus.
'Plan' will air from Thursday, March 8th through the Hawaii caucus on the 13th on cable television and select broadcast outlets.
The 30-second spot 'Plan' begins with the declaration that Ron Paul is "a visionary who predicted the financial crisis." Upbeat and hopeful in its tone, the ad centers squarely on Ron Paul's path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint for the nation that continues to earn high marks from fiscal experts, analysts, and political pundits.
"Ron Paul's ad 'Plan' is an ideal one to air in Hawaii, with its pleasant climate, because it helps separate him from the 'fair-weather conservatives' who are unwilling to make the tough decisions that will get our country back on track," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"Ron Paul is the only authentic conservative in the race and as demonstrated by his taking the long view toward the Hawaii caucus and other contests, he is the only candidate besides Mitt Romney with the resources and stamina to run an exhaustive 50-state campaign," added Mr. Benton.
