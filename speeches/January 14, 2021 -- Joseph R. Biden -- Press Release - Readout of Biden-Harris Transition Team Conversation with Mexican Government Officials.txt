    As a follow-up to the January 6, 2021 conversation between National Security Advisor-designate Jake Sullivan and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, members of the Biden-Harris transition team met today with representatives of the Mexican government to discuss migration. The transition team members expressed their desire to work with Mexico and other regional partners to address the root causes of migration, as well as the importance of fostering economic growth in Central America and a shared commitment to human rights and orderly migration. The discussion continues a long-established tradition of incoming Administrations engaging with their North American partners and focusing entirely on matters that will arise after inauguration, in preparation for cooperation between the two countries.
Note: The incoming Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations engaged their Mexican counterparts during the transition, up to and including presidential meetings before inauguration day.
