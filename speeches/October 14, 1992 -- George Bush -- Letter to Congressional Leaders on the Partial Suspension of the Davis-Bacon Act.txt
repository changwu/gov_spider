    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby report that I have exercised my statutory authority under section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a - 5, to suspend the provisions of sections 276a to 276a - 5 of the Davis-Bacon Act in the event of a national emergency. I have found that the conditions caused by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki constitute a "national emergency" within the meaning of section 6. I have, therefore, suspended the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act in designated areas in the States of Florida, Louisiana, and Hawaii.
This action is more fully set out in the enclosed proclamation that I have issued today.
Sincerely,
George Bush
