    I send greetings to the student leaders of America and wish for your meeting every success in clarifying your problems, and in deepening your determination to solve them in the spirit of devotion to that high .idealism characteristic of youth.
This Administration has been engrossed perforce in the problems of economic recovery. I am fully aware, however, that economic recovery is ultimately to be appraised in terms of the enrichment it makes possible in human lives. Human resources are above physical resources. The purposes which inspire the college youth of today will determine largely the value of the human resources of tomorrow. Your opportunity and your responsibility are alike great.
Mr. John Lang, President, National Student Federation, Boston, Massachusetts.
