  A Proclamation

The temporary services industry provides employers much needed flexibility to tailor their work forces to meet short-term needs. It also provides important job opportunities for American workers: last year, the temporary services industry provided employment for an estimated five million people.
The temporary services industry currently is the second fastest growing business sector in our economy, in terms of new jobs created. Approximately one out of every two hundred nonagricultural jobs in the United States is provided through temporary services.
It is appropriate that we recognize the many and vital contributions that the men and women of the temporary services industry provide to our economy.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 195, has designated the week of December 1 through December 7, 1985, as "National Temporary Services Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in commemoration of this observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of December 1 through December 7, 1985, as National Temporary Services Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
