Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have reviewed your report on the fine progress that has been made in implementing Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965, which created the Environmental Science Services Administration in the Department of Commerce.
In forwarding that Reorganization Plan to the Congress, I stated that the reorganization would permit us to provide better environmental information to vital segments of the nation's economy and enhance our capability to identify and solve problems associated with the physical environment. ESSA's accomplishments are bearing out these predictions.
Your report indicates that the reorganization has resulted in specific economies, improved management of programs, and better services to the public. This combination of achievements is basic to this Administration's concepts of how the public's business can and must be conducted. You stated in your letter that there is further progress to be made in the future. I am confident that this progress will be made.
I want to commend you, ESSA management, and all ESSA employees for the efficiency and sensitivity which have contributed to carrying out this reorganization. These accomplishments will benefit substantially the public and other agencies of the Government.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John T. Connor, Secretary of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230]
