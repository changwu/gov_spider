    The President announced today that he intends to nominate John F. Hicks, Jr., to be a member of the Board of Directors of the African Development Foundation. The African Development Foundation is an independent, nonprofit Government corporation which seeks to provide self-help initiatives to the poor populations of Africa. Last week, the President announced his intention to nominate Willie Grace Campbell and Marion M. Dawson to be among the Board's members.
"John Hicks has served our country well for almost 20 years and knows what the developing economies of Africa need in order to prosper," said the President. "He will be a strong addition to the African Development Foundation's Board."
