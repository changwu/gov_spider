    I have today approved H.R. 2342, the "Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1988," which in part authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989.
During congressional consideration of H.R. 2342, my Administration expressed serious concern about Section 30 of the bill, which might have been misconstrued to call for inappropriate competition by the Coast Guard Auxiliary with private sector towing operations when rendering nonemergency assistance to disabled vessels.
I have approved H.R. 2342 with the understanding, which is clearly supported by the Joint Statement of Managers to accompany the Conference Report on H.R. 2342, that this section is not intended to affect the Coast Guard's recently announced policy regarding nonemergency assistance. Accordingly, the Coast Guard will continue to implement this policy that, in the words of the conferees on H.R. 2342, represents "an attempt to strike a balance between the needs of commercial and volunteer interests, while still providing the highest level of safety services ....
