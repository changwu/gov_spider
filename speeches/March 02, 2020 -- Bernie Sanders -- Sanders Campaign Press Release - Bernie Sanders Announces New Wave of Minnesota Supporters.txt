Raymond Dehn is a Minnesota State Representative for District 59B. He is a product of public schools, a low-wealth worker, a formerly incarcerated person, an addict 40 years into recovery, and was once a small business-owner ravaged by the recession. He has served in the MN Legislature since 2013.
"In 2020, we have the opportunity to elect a leader who is building a multiracial and multi-generational movement of working people and that's why I'm excited to endorse Bernie Sanders for President. Bernie is the best candidate to move our country forward. We need leaders who understand that structural inequity was built into our nation's founding and are willing to disrupt the status quo in favor of equity. Bernie has broad solutions that will greatly improve the lives of people in communities like mine."

"Like me, Bernie has always been an advocate for the grassroots, the greatest underdogs in the community. From his college days organizing civil rights protests in solidarity with Black leaders, to his continued fight for Universal Healthcare and a Green New Deal, Bernie believes in the power of people and the true face of change. I hope you'll join me in the Minnesota primary on March 3rd to vote for Bernie Sanders."

Todd Lippert is in his first term as a State Representative. He grew up in a town of 700 people and has been a pastor for 17 years in small communities in Wisconsin and Minnesota. He ran for office because he cares about people who live in rural areas; he does not want politicians to divide us by race, religion, or geography anymore, and we need bold leadership on the climate.
"The poverty faced by so many rural communities is due to the concentration of wealth of fewer and fewer people. We will not make real progress on healthcare, climate, and racial and economic equity until we rein in the largest corporations and the billionaire class. Bernie understands this, and that's why he has the strongest campaign and the most enthusiastic supporters. I was for Bernie in 2016 and am for Bernie in 2020."

He doesn't care what your political party is, he just wants to make sure everyone can get healthcare that's actually affordable, have a good paying job and a fair economy, and be able to live in a country where going to college doesn't mean going into debt for the rest of our lives. Bernie's lifelong commitment to equity and politics led by the people is exactly the leadership our country needs."

Board Member Kara Gloe is an elected school board member in Moorhead, MN, currently serving in her second term. In addition to her service on the Moorhead School Board, she is pursuing a master's degree in social work.
"As an elected school board member, I have seen how the underfunding of education hurts school districts, families, and children. Bernie wants to pay teachers a starting wage of $60k, which would go a long way toward ending the teacher shortage we are experiencing in this country. He wants to move to a pre-K through 12 model, which would ensure that every child receives the best start possible. Additionally, he wants to raise the federal funding of special education to 50%, which would be a huge help to school districts providing these services for which they are not being fully reimbursed. Simply put, Bernie is the best choice for education, and that is one of the many reasons I endorse Bernie Sanders."

ORGANIZATIONS
Minnesota Youth Climate Strike
"MNYCS is endorsing Bernie Sanders because we need an organizer in chief. We currently have an administration that not only ignores the needs of our planet but actively works against it. But the current president isn't the only threat to our planet. If we choose a democratic candidate who thinks it's enough to simply believe climate change without taking bold action against it, it won't be enough to save us. We cannot afford to wait for climate action. We need a president that not only understands the urgency of climate change but is prepared to fight for the solutions that center those most affected by the climate crisis - people of color, people with disabilities, workers and the LGBTQI+ community."

I, too, want an economy that works for common working-class Americans, not simply the wealthy few. His bold vision and proven track record of fighting injustice is just what we need from the leadership in America today."
