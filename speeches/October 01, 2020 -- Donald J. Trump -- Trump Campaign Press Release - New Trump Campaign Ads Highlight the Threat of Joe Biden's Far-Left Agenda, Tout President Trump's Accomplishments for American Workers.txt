    President Trump's re-election campaign today released two new ads featuring testimonials from Americans whose livelihoods are being threatened by Joe Biden's radical left-wing policies but have prospered under President Trump. One ad, titled "Janelle and Kelvin," features testimonial from a couple who condemn Joe Biden's history of racist policies and mass incarceration, while commending President Trump's strong economic leadership. The other ad, titled "Jen," highlights a Pennsylvania fracking technician whose industry has thrived under the Trump Administration and would be eliminated under Joe Biden's harsh regulatory agenda.
These two ads are part of this week's eight-figure ad buy. "Janelle and Kelvin" will appear on local broadcast television in markets in Georgia and North Carolina, and "Jen" will air on local broadcast television in Western Pennsylvania.
