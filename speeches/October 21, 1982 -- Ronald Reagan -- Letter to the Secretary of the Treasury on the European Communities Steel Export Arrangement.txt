    Dear Mr. Secretary:
Pursuant to Arrangements between the United States and the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), dated October 21, 1982, the ECSC and the EEC have agreed to establish export licenses or other export measures with respect to steel mill products specified under these Arrangements, which are exported after October 31, 1982 and before January 1, 1986, and are exported to, or destined for consumption in, the United States. Accordingly, I request under section 626 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by section 153 of Public Law 97-27.6, that you monitor and enforce the measures taken within these Arrangements by requiring when necessary the presentation of valid export certificates or other documents issued by appropriate authorities within the European Communities or their member states as a condition for entry into the United States of steel mill products from the European Communities.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Donald Regan, Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220]
