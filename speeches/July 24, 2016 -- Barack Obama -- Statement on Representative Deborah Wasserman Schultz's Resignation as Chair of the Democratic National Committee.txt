    For the last 8 years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon I called her to let her know that I am grateful. Her leadership of the DNC has meant that we had someone who brought Democrats together not just for my reelection campaign, but for accomplishing the shared goals we have had for our country. Her critical role in supporting our economic recovery, our fights for social and civil justice and providing health care for all Americans will be a hallmark of her tenure as party chair. Her fundraising and organizing skills were matched only by her passion, her commitment and her warmth. And no one works harder for her constituents in Congress than Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Michelle and I are grateful for her efforts, we know she will continue to serve our country as a Member of Congress from Florida, and she will always be our dear friend.
