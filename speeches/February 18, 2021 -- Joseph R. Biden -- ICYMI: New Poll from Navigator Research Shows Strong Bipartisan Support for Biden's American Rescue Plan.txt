    Poll Shows nearly 3 in 4 Americans support plan, and 50% of Republicans support plan
A new poll from Navigator Research shows that 73% of Americans support President Biden's American Rescue Plan, including 53% of Republicans. The poll also found that more than half of Americans approve of how Biden is handling the economy, including nearly a third who strongly approve.
Navigator found that "The majority of Americans – including 50% of Republicans – cite the stimulus payments for working families as the most convincing reason to pass the stimulus package."
The Navigator poll is just the latest evidence that the American Rescue Plan has bipartisan support. Findings in a CBS poll showed 83% of Americans support for the plan, a recent Quinnipiac poll showered that 68% of Americans also approve of the plan, and new survey from CNBC showed 63% of small business owners support President Biden's American Rescue Plan. This latest poll from Navigator also follows the endorsement of more than 400 more bipartisan mayors across the nation. 
And, this Navigator poll echoes the concerns of the majority of American's and a long list of economists and economic organizations urging the benefits of immediate relief including Brookings, Moody's Analytics, and the Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund. And a Reuters survey of dozens of economists found that over 90% believed that it would "boost the economy significantly."
