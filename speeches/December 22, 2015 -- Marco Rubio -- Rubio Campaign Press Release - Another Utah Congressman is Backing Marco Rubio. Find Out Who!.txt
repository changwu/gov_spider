Bishop joins an already excellent team of supporters in Utah backing Marco.
Bishop now joins a group that includes fellow U.S. House members Chris Stewart and Mia Love, along with Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox.
"No candidate better understands the challenges facing our nation in the 21st Century than Marco Rubio and it's my honor to endorse him for president," Bishop said in a statement Tuesday.
Bishop is currently serving as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Representative Bishop, welcome to Team Marco!
