    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) TX)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5640, which would establish a uniform, nationwide system for the collection of debts owed the Federal Government. The Administration will, however, work with Congress to conform the bill to the proposal submitted by the Department of Justice to the House Judiciary Committee on August 10, 1990.
