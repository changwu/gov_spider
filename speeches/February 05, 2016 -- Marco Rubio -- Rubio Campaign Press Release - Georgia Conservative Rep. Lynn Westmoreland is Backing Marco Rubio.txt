Westmoreland cited Marco's strength on foreign policy and national security as a driving factor. Here's what he had to say:
Over the last 7 years, the Obama Administration has crippled our presence abroad. We are no longer seen as the world leader to promote democracy, peace, and freedom for all. What America needs now more than ever is leadership, and I believe Marco Rubio is the man for the job.
Marco's experience on the Senate Intelligence Committee and his strong stance on foreign policy make him the most qualified candidate to lead our nation. He understands the threats our country faces every day, and how to protect our nation, citizens, and interests abroad. I am proud to give my support to Marco Rubio, the next President of the United States.
Georgia's largest newspaper, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, notes that Westmoreland adds to a growing list of supporters in the state, where Marco's building momentum — and a growing slate of conservative leaders for Marco nationally.Rep. Westmoreland, welcome to Team Marco!
