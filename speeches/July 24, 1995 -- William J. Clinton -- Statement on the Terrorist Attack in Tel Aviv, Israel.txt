    On behalf of all Americans, I offer my deepest condolences to the Government and people of Israel at this tragic moment. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this terrorist atrocity and their loved ones.
We join with all those working for peace in expressing our outrage and condemning in the strongest possible manner this brutal act. Those responsible are seeking to deny to Israelis and Palestinians alike the realization of a new and better life of peace and hope. But they shall not be allowed to succeed. Their vision is of the past, not of the future, of hatred, not the reconciliation which Israeli and Palestinian peacemakers are striving to achieve.
Peace requires courage. The people of Israel have demonstrated enormous resolve and determination in pursuing the path of peace. Through times of suffering as well as rejoicing, the Government and people of the United States stand with them.
