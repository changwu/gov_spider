    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ailes, and Mr. Cherne :
I thank you, first of all, for taking on this responsibility which, I think, is extremely significant in the reorganization of the intelligence community. As all three of you know, we told the intelligence community what they have to do on the one hand and what they can't do on the other hand.
We have sought to achieve accountability so that individuals in the various intelligence agencies will know precisely what their responsibilities are and to whom they are accountable. But the main new addition, which, I think, is fundamentally necessary, is the Oversight Board.
And you, Mr. Chairman and Steve and Leo, are to act as an independent auditor on what takes place within the intelligence community. You are not to be influenced by the White House on the one hand, and you are not to be influenced by the intelligence community on the other. And your responsibility is an independent area of responsibility.
I just want to thank the three of you. I know you bring together a good many years of Government service, but also of dedication to what is in the best interest of the country. So I am delighted that you have accepted, and I am confident that the role played by this board will be reassuring to the American people.
