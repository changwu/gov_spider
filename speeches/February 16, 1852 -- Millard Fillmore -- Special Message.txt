    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to Congress a letter addressed to the Secretary of State by the commissioner of the United States under the convention with Brazil, setting forth the obstacles which have impeded the conclusion of the business of that commission.
MILLARD FILLMORE,
