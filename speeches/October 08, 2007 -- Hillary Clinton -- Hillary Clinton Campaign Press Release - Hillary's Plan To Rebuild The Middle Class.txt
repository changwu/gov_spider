    America is only as strong as our middle class. And Hillary will judge the health of our economy by asking whether our middle class is expanding and getting ahead.
We have to change our economic course, just as we have to change course in Iraq, and change course in providing health care to all Americans. When it comes to the economy, Hillary has the strength and experience to make that change happen -- and make our economy work again for our middle class and for all our people.
Hillary's plan is an economic blueprint for the 21st Century to rebuild our middle class and deliver the change America needs.
It is a plan that will create the new, good jobs essential to broad-based prosperity; restore fairness to our economy; renew the basic bargain that if you work hard, you can get ahead; and put our fiscal house in order again.
Under the Bush Administration, income inequality has widened and the middle class has fallen further behind. Many families have been squeezed by exploding health care premiums, rising college tuitions and a weakening housing market.
Hillary understands that a vibrant middle class is vital to America's prosperity. Her broad-based plan would provide families with access to quality, affordable health care and education, and help them save for retirement. To spur economic growth, Hillary would invest in innovation and alternative energy to create the high-paying jobs of the 21st Century.
Hillary's plan would also confront the impact of globalization by strengthening unions and workers' rights, while ensuring that our trade laws are properly enforced.
The middle class is the backbone of our economy and the key to America's economic prosperity. Hillary's plan expands opportunity and once again ensures that the road to the middle class—and the American Dream—is within reach for all Americans.
