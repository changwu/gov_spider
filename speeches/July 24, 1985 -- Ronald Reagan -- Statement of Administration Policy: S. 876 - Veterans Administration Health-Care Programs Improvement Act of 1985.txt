    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Murkowski (R) Alaska)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 876.
The bill (1) places unwarranted restrictions on the VA Administrator s ability to make decisions and set priorities affecting the construction and other needs of the agency, (2) diminishes the Administrator's authority to manage VA personnel, and (3) duplicates numerous programs already being carried by the VA.
