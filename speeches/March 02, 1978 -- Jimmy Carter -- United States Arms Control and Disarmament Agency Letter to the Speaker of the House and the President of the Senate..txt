    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I transmit herewith for consideration of the Congress proposed legislation to extend the appropriation authorization for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, together with a letter from the Acting Director of the Agency in support of this legislation.
Stopping the arms race, both the nuclear arms race and the spread of increasingly more advanced technology in non-nuclear arms, may well be the single most important task we must accomplish to ensure national security and the survival of mankind. The U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency plays a very important part in accomplishing this goal.
Through the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, in which it has the leading role, the Agency is engaged in preventing a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. And at the Comprehensive Test Ban Talks, the Agency is working to control the spread of nuclear weapons through measures that will inhibit their further development. The Agency is also involved in researching techniques for preventing the unintended spread of nuclear weapon materials through the nuclear fuel cycle and in controlling the transfer of conventional weapons and advanced technology.
Additionally, the Agency engages in research which supports on-going arms control negotiations and explores possibilities for further progress and new initiatives in arms control.
Current authorization and appropriations for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency expire September 30, 1978. I am transmitting the attached draft bill in order that the Congress may begin its consideration of future authorizing legislation for the Agency. I urge the early enactment of this legislation.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
