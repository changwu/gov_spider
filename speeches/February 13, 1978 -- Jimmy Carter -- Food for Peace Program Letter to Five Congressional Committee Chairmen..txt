    In accordance with the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1977, I herewith forward a comprehensive study of the payment of ocean freight differentials between United States-flag rates and foreign-flag rates when United States-flag vessels are required to be used for the shipment of agricultural commodities under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (PL-480).
I endorse the recommendation of the study that the responsibility for funding PL-480 ocean freight differentials be retained in the Department of Agriculture, but that the presentation of the Department of Agriculture's budget to the Congress be improved by clearly identifying these costs as support of the U.S. merchant marine. I believe that the recommended change in budget presentation will avoid the concealment of a subsidy in the budget without imposing an undue administrative burden on the departments and agencies.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
