(House Rules)
(Rep. Welch, D-Vermont, and 44 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5019, the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act of 2010. The Administration shares the sponsors' commitment to establishing a program of incentives to encourage homeowners to make their homes more energy-efficient. H.R. 5019 will provide consumers up-front rebates for many home energy-saving investments such as improved insulation; upgraded heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; and energy-efficient windows. The bill will create green jobs in construction and manufacturing, help consumers lower their energy bills, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration applauds the bipartisan efforts that have brought H.R. 5019 to the House floor and looks forward to the passage of this legislation.
