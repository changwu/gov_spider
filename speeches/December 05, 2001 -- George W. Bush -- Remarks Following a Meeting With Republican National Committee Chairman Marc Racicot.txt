    The President. I had the honor of, first, thanking Jim Gilmore for his service to the Republican Party. I asked Jim to take on an assignment. He did it, and he did it well. And for that, I'm grateful. We talked about a week ago, and he said he wanted to spend more time with his family, and he wanted to prepare for his transition out of public service as Governor of Virginia. The people of the Commonwealth of Virginia know what I know, that he's an honorable public servant who served our State and our party well.
And to take Jim's place, I've asked my friend Marc Racicot, the former Governor of Montana, to become the chairman of the RNC. He's agreed, for which I'm grateful. Marc has got a history of success. He knows how to build grassroots organizations. He's going to reach out to members of the labor unions and the minorities, just like Jim Gilmore did, to continue to take our positive, optimistic message to people thatâ€”in all kinds of neighborhoods around the country. He has got a fine history of winning races, and he'll translate that into practice come next fall, in the 2002 races. And I'm really, really pleased Marc has agreed to take on this assignment.
I also want to welcome Ann Wagner here, the vice chairman of the party, to the Oval Office.
I wish you all the best, Marc. Thanks for taking on the job, and I look forward to working with you.
Q. You haven't changed your mind?
The President. I'll talk to you later.
