    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the leadership team for Florida Business Leaders for Rudy. These businessmen and businesswomen will help promote Rudy's commitment to cutting wasteful government spending, restoring fiscal discipline and cutting taxes.
"Business leaders across Florida are supporting Rudy Giuliani because they know he is the strongest fiscal conservative running for President," said Debbie Jallad, Co-Chair of Florida Business Leaders for Rudy and President and Owner of Accredited Bond Agencies of Winter Park. "Rudy's commitment to easing the burden on businesses and American taxpayers, as with all of his commitments, is backed up by his fiscal record as Mayor of New York City."
On Saturday, Mayor Rudy Giuliani discussed his commitment to cut taxes and reform the tax code with taxpayers and small business owners in Manchester, New Hampshire at his "Your Money. Your Choice." forum.
During his eight years as the Mayor of New York City, Giuliani helped stimulate the local economy by cutting taxes 23 times and turning a $2.3 billion deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus. As part of Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People, Mayor Giuliani pledges to restore fiscal discipline to Washington, while cutting both wasteful spending and taxes.
