    Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Kurdistan Regional President Masoud Barzani today. The Vice President and President Barzani discussed ongoing military efforts against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They agreed on the importance of continuing the historic cooperation underway between the Kurdish Peshmerga and the Iraqi security forces, which—with support from the United States and other partners—helped retake the strategic Mosul Dam. President Barzani reaffirmed his commitment to supporting Prime Minister-Designate Haider Al-Abadi and other Iraqi leaders in their efforts to form a new Iraqi government as rapidly as possible.
