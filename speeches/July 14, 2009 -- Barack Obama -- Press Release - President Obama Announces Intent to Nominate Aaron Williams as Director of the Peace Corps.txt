    WASHINGTON, DC â€“ President Obama today announced his intent to nominate Aaron Williams to be Director of the Peace Corps.
President Obama said, "America was built on a belief that the best progress comes from ordinary citizens working to bring about the change they believe in. Through a lifetime of service, Aaron Williams has embodied the very best of that American ideal. I am grateful for his service and honored to nominate him to direct the critical work of the Peace Corps."
The announcement comes as the President prepares to throw out the first pitch at tonight's Major League Baseball All-Star Game and appear in a video with all five living presidents to spotlight the stories of five of Major League Baseball's "All-Stars Among Us," Americans who have undertaken extraordinary service in their communities. Answering the President's call to service through United We Serve, Major League Baseball has dedicated this year's All-Star Game and the events surrounding it to highlighting the critical importance of community service. United We Serve is the President's initiative encouraging all Americans to engage in sustained and meaningful service in their communities.
