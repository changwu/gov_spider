    Joe Biden and his media allies are lying.
President Trump has repeatedly made it clear that he will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. Democrats, Joe Biden, and the media keep lying about this, but the fact is that President Trump made "cover all pre-existing conditions" a key point in his second term agenda.
In stark contrast to President Trump's health care agenda, Joe Biden wants to implement a dangerous health care plan that will decrease Americans' quality of care, ultimately eliminate all private health insurance, bankrupt rural hospitals, and give taxpayer-funded health care benefits to illegal aliens.
President Trump is the only candidate in the race who will actually fight for American patients. He will keep his promise to always fight for Americans with pre-existing conditions! Watch:
