    Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Stacey Grigsby, Deputy White House Counsel, met with Attorneys General Dana Nessel of Michigan and Keith Ellison of Minnesota to discuss efforts underway in key states to protect reproductive rights. Vice President Harris later joined the meeting and reaffirmed the Administration's commitment to fighting for reproductive rights. The Vice President discussed the pivotal role that Attorneys General play in safeguarding the rights of the people of their states, and she encouraged them to continue to use their authority to defend reproductive rights and freedoms.
Both Attorneys General have taken significant action to protect access to abortion. Attorney General Nessel pledged not to deploy state resources to enforce Michigan's 1931 abortion ban, a relic of an era before Roe was decided. On June 21, Attorney General Ellison reassured Minnesotans and the people of every state that no one will be prosecuted in Minnesota for seeking, helping someone else seek, or providing an abortion that is legal in Minnesota.
Senior Administration officials thanked the Attorneys General for their efforts to protect reproductive rights, and committed to working together in the months ahead to protect a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Today's conversation followed a meeting Vice President Harris convened with seven Attorneys General last week to discuss reproductive rights.
