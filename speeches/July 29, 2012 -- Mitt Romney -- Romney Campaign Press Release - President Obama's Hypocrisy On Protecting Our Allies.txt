    "President Obama's campaign may be eager to take credit for the missile defense program protecting Israel. But that hasn't stopped the Obama White House from attempting to curb funding for Israeli missile defense in years past. Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States, and they deserve an administration that won't play politics with programs that impact their safety." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
President Obama Has Repeatedly Tried To Take Credit For Protecting Israel's Missile Defense:
Today, Obama Campaign Senior Adviser Robert Gibbs Touted President Obama's Efforts To Protect Israeli Missile Defense. GIBBS: "We went to a city in Israel, Sderot that was being bombarded by rockets from Gaza. On that trip, began the formulation of the policy that is now in place, called the Iron Dome, which protects the citizens not just of that city but throughout Israel, because this president has had the strongest commitment of any U.S. president to Israel security." (ABC's "This Week," 7/29/12)
President Obama, Last Week: "Critical In Terms Of Providing Security And Safety For The Israeli Families." OBAMA: "I'm also very pleased that this week we are going to be able to announce $70 million in additional spending -- $70 billion [million]*, excuse me, in additional spending for Iron Dome.  This is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for the Israeli families." (President Barack Obama, Remarks, Washington, DC, 7/27/12)
But President Obama's Latest Funding Is Just Another Election-Year Conversion From An Administration That Has Repeatedly Tried To Curb Spending For Israeli Missile Defense:
Since 2011, The Obama Administration Has Suggested Cuts To The Israeli Missile Defense Program And Has Suggested More Than $6 Million In Cuts In 2013. "Between 2011 and 2012, though, the Obama administration suggested more than $15 million in cuts to Israeli missile defense. In the 2013 budget, the White House suggested more than $6 million in cuts." (Melissa Quinn, "Obama Evolves On Israel Security Bill Just Before Romney Visit," The Daily Caller, 7/29/12)
"In February, Chairs Of Both The House Armed Services And Foreign Relation Committees Sent A Letter To The Obama Administration Questioning The Defunding Of The Missile Defense System..." "In February, chairs of both the House Armed Services and Foreign Relation committees sent a letter to the Obama administration questioning the defunding of the missile defense system. 'We respectfully urge, in the strongest terms, that you reconsider your budget request for this vital component of US-Israel defense cooperation,' the letter, signed by House Armed Services Chair Buck McKeon and House Foreign Relation Chair Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, told Obama." (Melissa Quinn, "Obama Evolves On Israel Security Bill Just Before Romney Visit," The Daily Caller, 7/29/12)

    President Obama To Russian President Medvedev: "After My Election I Have More Flexibility."  OBAMA: "On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved but it's important for him to give me space." PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV: "Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about space. Space for you..." OBAMA: "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." MEDVEDEV: "I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir."
