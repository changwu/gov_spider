    February is Black History Month and a time when we honor the significant contributions that African-Americans have made to the American culture and way of life. We reflect and pay special tribute to the courageous men and women who through their action and steadfastness opened doors paving the way for future generations. They were true American trailblazers and their efforts made an indelible mark on our great country.
Black history is American history and should be celebrated today and every day that we as Americans enjoy the freedoms and the liberties that make us who we are.
