    The Maryland Legislature did the right thing for its workers today by increasing the State minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Maryland's important action is a reminder that many States, cities and counties, as well as a majority of the American people, are way ahead of Washington on this crucial issue. I applaud Governor O'Malley and the State legislature for leading by example and giving more Maryland workers the raise they deserve. But there's only one group who can get the job done for the entire countryâ€”that's Congress. They should follow Maryland's lead and lift wages for 28 million Americans by passing legislation to increase the Federal minimum wage to $10.10, helping to ensure that no American who works full time has to raise a family in poverty and that every American who works hard has the opportunity to succeed.
