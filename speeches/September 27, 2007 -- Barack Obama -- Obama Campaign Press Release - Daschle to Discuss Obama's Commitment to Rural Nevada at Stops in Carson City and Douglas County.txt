    Reno, NV -- Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, national co-chairman for Barack Obama's presidential campaign, will make two stops in rural Nevada today where he will discuss Obama's commitment to rural issues. Daschle, who represented South Dakota for more than twenty-five years in the House and Senate, has a record of fighting for rural issues including access to affordable healthcare and the development of alternative energy.
"Barack Obama is the kind of leader who will stand up for the needs of families in rural communities," said Senator Tom Daschle. "We need to move beyond ideology and partisanship and meet our common challenges with common sense and Senator Obama is the right leader to bring about the change we need."
