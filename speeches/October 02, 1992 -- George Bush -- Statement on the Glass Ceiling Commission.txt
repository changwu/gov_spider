    I am pleased to recognize the inaugural meeting of the Glass Ceiling Commission, which will focus on examining and eliminating discriminatory barriers to the advancement of women and minorities to senior positions in the workplace.
The Commission's work will complement the ongoing effort that I have made a priority in my administration: to assure women and minorities an opportunity to serve in upper echelons in Government, to be measured by the same standard as men. I have made record numbers of appointments of women and minorities to senior-level positions. I am proud that I appointed a talented team of women to the most senior economic positions, and I would like to see the business world follow my lead.
I am certain that under Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin's leadership, the Commission will aggressively pursue its 4-year agenda. The work of this Commission will help equip the Nation to make the most of every member of the 21st century work force.
