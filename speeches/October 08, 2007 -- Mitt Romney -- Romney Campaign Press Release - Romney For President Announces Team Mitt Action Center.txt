Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President announced the launch of Team Mitt Action Center, an online social networking platform that shares features common to popular social networks like Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn. Team Mitt Action Center empowers Governor Romney's supporters at every level to make a direct, positive impact on his presidential campaign.
Team Mitt Action Center features include the ability to load your picture and customize your profile; to create and manage events in your neighborhood; to engage in grassroots, peer-to-peer fundraising; and to network with friends and fellow supporters across America. After the current beta phase, additional features and expanded functionality will be added to accommodate Romney supporters as the campaign progresses.
As part of the launch, Romney for President is also announcing "Ask Team Mitt Anything," a weekly series of live, online, text-based chats with prominent supporters and members of the campaign.
Campaign Manager Beth Myers will host the first chat on Tuesday, October 9 at 2pm EDT in anticipation of Governor Romney's participation in the CNBC/MSNBC/Wall Street Journal debate in Michigan. Ann Romney, Political Director Carl Forti, and Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) will host "Ask Team Mitt Anything" chats in future weeks. All chat hosts will have Team Mitt Action Center profiles to maintain an ongoing connection with campaign supporters.
Mindy Finn, Director of eStrategy, said, "Team Mitt Action Center continues our campaign's practice of providing cutting-edge, innovative, and democratizing tools for voters to get involved in the political process. And the 'Ask Team Mitt Anything' chat series will provide a great opportunity for our campaign to engage and interact with supporters across America."
