    His Majesty
Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Saud
King of Saudi Arabia
It is with a profound sense of loss that I express my deepest sympathy to the Royal Family and people of Saudi Arabia upon the death of their illustrious father and ruler, King Abdul Aziz al Saud. His Majesty's statesmanship and sagacity as a ruler endeared him to the hearts of his people and won him universal renown. The American people were proud to count him and his nation among their most trusted and valued friends.
On this solemn occasion I wish to extend to Your Majesty, as your father's worthy successor, my good wishes upon your accession to the throne. I am confident that the warm bonds of friendship and mutual interest, which have bound our two countries so closely in the past, will remain firm and enduring under your able guidance. The people of Saudi Arabia are indeed fortunate to have their destiny served by a ruler so progressive and devoted to their welfare as yourself.
