    On April 9, President Obama will host President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil for meetings at the White House as part of the Leaders' on-going dialogue regarding the growing partnership between the United States and Brazil across a wide range of issues. The Presidents will have the opportunity to follow up on progress made under the three presidential dialogues launched during President Obama's March 2011 visit to Brazil - the Strategic Energy Dialogue, the Economic and Financial Dialogue, and the Global Partnership Dialogue. These meetings will also provide the two Leaders the opportunity to again meet with the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum and continue efforts to grow commercial, economic, education, and innovation ties between our two countries.
President Obama looks forward to discussing cooperation on a host of other bilateral, regional, and multilateral issues, especially as he looks towards his participation in the Summit of the Americas in Colombia in April and the G-20 in Mexico in June.
