    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as amended (47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1997 and the Inventory of the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications Entities by Federal Departments and Agencies: Fiscal Year 1997.
Thirty years following the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Congress can take great pride in its creation. During these 30 years, the American public has been educated, inspired, and enriched by the programs and services made possible by this investment.
The need for and the accomplishments of this national network of knowledge have never been more apparent, and as the attached 1997 annual CPB report indicates, by "Going Digital," public broadcasting will have an ever greater capacity for fulfilling its mission.
