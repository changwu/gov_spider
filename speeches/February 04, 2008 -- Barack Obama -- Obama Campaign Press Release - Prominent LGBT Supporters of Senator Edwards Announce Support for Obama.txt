    Chicago, IL - Former LGBT supporters of Senator John Edwards and other candidates are publicly announcing their support of Senator Barack Obama. Almost half of Senator Edwards' original LGBT steering committee is throwing their support behind Obama. Most of the other former members remain formally uncommitted.
Eric Stern and David Mixner are two of the twenty-eight new supporters who are working to elect Senator Obama. Stern served as a political advisor to Edwards and was the head of his LGBT steering committee. Mixner was a key advisor to the Clinton campaign in 1992. Mixner also organized some of the first LGBT fund-raisers for a U.S. presidential candidate.
"Moving from one candidate to another is never an easy process," said Mixner, "But the times demand that we all participate fully and completely to bring about change. Originally, my support went to Senator Edwards because of the war in Iraq. For the very same reason, I am supporting Senator Obama. This is not even a close call for me."
"It became clear to me personally that our committee had a vision for the role of the LGBT community that was similar to the role that LGBT supporters were already playing in the Obama campaign," said Stern. "It, like the Edwards Campaign, is a pure grassroots, activist-oriented operation…and it's clear that we will play a similar role in the Obama campaign."
The new supporters will help grassroots efforts leading up to the February 5th primaries and the rest of the primary season by reaching out to voters by phone banking and canvassing.
"We believe that Obama can pick up more delegates if the 12%-15% of Edwards supporters nationwide -- and even more in some states -- will turn out for Obama," Stern said. "We believe we can make a difference."
Other key members who have put their support behind Obama are:
Arizona -- Linda Elliott, member of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors and a major fund-raiser for defeating the state's constitutional marriage amendment;
California—Jeff Anderson and Jeff Soukup, former California co-chairs of Edwards for President; Gloria Nieto, Former Vice Chair of DNC LGBT Caucus; Evan Low, out council member for the city of Campbell; Pam Cooke, National Stonewall Democrats board member; past president, Stonewall Democratic Club of Los Angeles
Colorado—Andy Szekeres, former co-chair of Colorado Stonewall Democrats;
Georgia -- Kyle Bailey, chair of the Atlanta Stonewall Democrats; LGBT Caucus vice chair of the Young Democrats of America; former board member of the National Stonewall Democrats;
Tennessee - Jim Maynard, president of the Memphis Stonewall Democrats
