BEREA, Ohio – The momentum building behind Bernie Sanders' White House campaign was on display here in Cuyahoga County on Thursday when 3,600 supporters showed up on a snowy winter morning at Baldwin Wallace University.
Two weeks before Buckeye State voters go to the polls, Sanders told the crowd that three new national polls for the first time put him ahead of Hillary Clinton, once considered by pundits to have a lock on the nomination. A recent Baldwin Wallace University poll in Ohio found Sanders leading Clinton 45 percent to 44 percent in the state.
Even more importantly for Democrats' hopes of retaining the White House, polls consistently have shown Sanders leading Republican front-runner Donald Trump by much bigger margins than Clinton. 
Now Sanders has moved ahead of Clinton by six points, 42 percent to 36 percent, in the latest Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. Also within the past week, a Fox News poll had the senator overtaking the former secretary of state 47 percent to 44 percent. A poll for McLaughlin & Associates released on Feb. 17 had Sanders edging Clinton 42.6 percent to 42.5 percent.
"With your help we can win this primary," Sanders told the cheering Cleveland-area crowd.
