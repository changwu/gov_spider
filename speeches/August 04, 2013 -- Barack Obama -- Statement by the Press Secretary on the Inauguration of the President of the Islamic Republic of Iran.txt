    On the occasion of Dr. Hojjatoleslam Hassan Rouhani's inauguration today as the Islamic Republic of Iran's seventh president, we again congratulate the Iranian people for making their voices heard during Iran's election. We note that President Rouhani recognized his election represented a call by the Iranian people for change, and we hope the new Iranian government will heed the will of the voters by making choices that will lead to a better life for the Iranian people. The inauguration of President Rouhani presents an opportunity for Iran to act quickly to resolve the international community's deep concerns over Iran's nuclear program. Should this new government choose to engage substantively and seriously to meet its international obligations and find a peaceful solution to this issue, it will find a willing partner in the United States.
