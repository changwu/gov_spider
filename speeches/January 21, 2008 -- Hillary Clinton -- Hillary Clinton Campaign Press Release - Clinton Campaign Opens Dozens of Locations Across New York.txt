    Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Binghamton, Poughkeepsie, White Plains, Garden City, Farmingville All Open Regional Offices This Week
NEW YORK â€“ The New York State headquarters of Hillary Clinton's campaign today announced that this week it is opening nine regional offices, each with fulltime staff, and twenty-five phone bank locations across the state for phone banking, volunteer recruitment and organizing. The campaign has hundreds of phone lines available for phone banking and will be opening additional locations for phone banking in the coming days.
"We are gratified by the outpouring of support for Sen Clinton throughout New York, but are taking nothing for granted and working hard for every vote," Clinton spokesman Blake Zeff said today. "These offices will ensure that we have the presence and resources to harness the grassroots enthusiasm for Hillary across the state."
Over 20,000 New Yorkers have signed up online to volunteer for Hillary through her website and the campaign boasts a grassroots network of some 2,000 "Ambassadors," who have activated their personal networks in support of Hillary. In addition, dozens of volunteers each day work phones and lick envelopes, with several supporters hosting BYOP parties (Bring Your Own Phone) where supporters phone bank for 2 hours at their homes.
The campaign has volunteer "Hill Leaders" in each of the 29 Congressional Districts to head up its Get Out the Vote (GOTV) operation, as well as a state director, political operation, and press operation in place for the February 5 primary. In addition there are over a dozen grassroots organizing meetings set up across the state to build its women's network. Over 1,000 New Yorkers headed to New Hampshire for the final five days of the primary on buses from Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Westchester, Long Island and New York City and in carpools. New Yorkers also made tens of thousands of calls to New Hampshire from phone banks.
This show of grassroots and organizational enthusiasm comes as a Siena Research Institute poll out today shows Hillary leading the New York primary by 25 points.
