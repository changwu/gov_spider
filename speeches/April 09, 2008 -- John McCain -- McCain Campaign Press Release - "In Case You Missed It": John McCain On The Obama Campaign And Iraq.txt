April 9, 2008
FOX NEWS' MEGYN KELLY: "Senator, one of the criticisms of General Petraeus yesterday and of some Republicans on the Hill is that no clear exit plan in Iraq was laid out. Indeed, earlier in the week that had at least one Democrat calling you a 'warmonger' because there is no clear, quote, exit strategy. Your reaction to that?" 
JOHN MCCAIN: "Well, I think those kinds of comments are very unfortunate, and if Senator Obama is going to wage the kind of campaign that he says he is, I hope that he will, he personally, will repudiate that kind of language. The exit strategy is success of the surge, continued Iraqi ability to take over their security, requirements to have the democratic process go forward. It's the classic counterinsurgency strategy. There has been significant improvement. But we've seen in the events in Basra in the last few days with the attacks on the Green Zone that this is still a tough fight. There's still plenty of difficulties ahead. That's why General Petraeus, I think portrayed a very balanced view yesterday of the situation on the ground. And I think most Americans trust him. I certainly do."
