    In a new ad going on the air today in Washington state, Hillary Clinton makes clear that she is the ONLY candidate for President - Democrat or Republican - with a plan to provide universal health care for every American.
The 30-second spot, entitled "Happen," comes two days before Washington voters go to caucus on February 9th.
The ad describes Hillary's efforts to pass universal health care in the 1990s and her perseverance in championing the Children's Health Insurance Program that now covers more than 6 million kids a year. It also talks about her successful efforts to push drug companies to lower the cost of vaccinations.

Following is the script for the ad.
"Happen"
TV :30
Announcer: She fought for universal health care, long before it was popular.
Championed the bill that gave six million kids health insurance
...and pushed the drug companies to lower the cost of vaccinations.
Now, she's the only candidate for President - Democrat or Republican - with a plan to provide health care for every American.
Just one reason why she's earned the support of Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.
Because health care is a moral obligation, not a privilege.
Saturday. Caucus for Hillary.
Hillary Clinton: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
