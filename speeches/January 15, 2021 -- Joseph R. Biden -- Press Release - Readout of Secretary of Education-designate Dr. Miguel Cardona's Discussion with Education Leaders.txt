    Yesterday, Secretary of Education-designate Dr. Michael Cardona met with leaders of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA) to discuss a range of issues and commit to building a culture of trust, collaboration, and partnership as the Biden-Harris Administration aims to get schools the resources they need to meet the goal of safely reopening a majority of K-8 schools within the first 100 days of the administration, and address learning loss as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, they discussed the importance of bringing the teacher voice to the table in department decision-making, particularly recognizing during the pandemic, teachers know and understand the needs of students better than anyone. They also discussed the need to address the shared trauma educators and the entire school community are facing. Dr. Cardona thanked the education leaders for their partnership and reiterated his commitment to ongoing collaboration.
