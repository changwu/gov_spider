    President Donald J. Trump's healthcare vision is putting America first by providing higher quality healthcare at a lower cost for patients. Since taking office, the President has been committed to putting healthcare back in the hands of the American peopleâ€”where it belongs. The Trump Administration has taken unprecedented actions to lower prescription drug prices, end surprise medical billing, reduce the price of insulin, protect people with pre-existing conditions, and allow the American people to keep their doctors. This bold and dynamic plan is providing the hard-working men and women of our country more choice, better care, and lower cost.
