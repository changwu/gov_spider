    Last November, I announced my intention to seek modifications to our Visa Waiver Program that would offer our closest partners in Central and Eastern Europe as well as others, such as the Republic of Korea, an accelerated process for admission to the program as we strengthen the program's security components. I am committed to continuing to work with Congress to produce legislation that would strengthen our country's security by implementing this initiative. It is in our Nation's interest to facilitate travel to the United States and, at the same time, to prevent terrorists from being able to exploit that travel.
