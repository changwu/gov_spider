    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today the Cruz for President campaign announced that Ted Cruz has received the endorsement of Gun Owners of Vermont.
"After researching all the remaining candidates, Gun Owners of Vermont is satisfied to report that Ted Cruz is the only TRUE pro-gun candidate for the office of President of the United States," said Ed Cutler, President of Gun Owners of Vermont. Cutler continued, "Ted Cruz has a long history of unwavering support for, and a no-compromise commitment to, the Second Amendment. Ted has always been the strongest Second Amendment voice in Washington."
"I'm honored to receive the endorsement of Gun Owners of Vermont," said Cruz. "I have been proud to fight to defend our individual right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed to each of us by the Second Amendment. As President, I'll continue to lead the fight in defense of the Second Amendment and our entire Bill of Rights."
The endorsement by Gun Owners of Vermont reaffirms Ted Cruz's status as the fiercest defender of the Second Amendment in the Republican field.
Cruz led the fight against Congress' 2013 legislation to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans, authored legislation to strengthen citizens' Second Amendment rights and allow interstate firearms sales, assembled a coalition of 31 states in defense of the Second Amendment in District of Columbia v. Heller where the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a ban on firearms in a 5-4 landmark decision, and argued against unreasonable and burdensome gun restrictions before the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Cruz was awarded the NRA's 2010 Carter-Knight Freedom Fund, which "rewards exemplary activities in the support and protection of the right to Keep and Bear Arms" for his work in the Heller and McDonald cases.
Cruz has also been endorsed by Gun Owners of America.
