    LAS VEGAS, NV -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its California Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition members. On Monday several California small business owners endorsed John McCain's economic plan, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's Jobs for America plan to grow the economy.
"John McCain's long standing commitment to keep government spending in check and to promote a healthy environment for small businesses is why I support Senator McCain," said Herb Morgan, of Efficient Market Advisors. "Senator Obama has put forward an economic plan that will saddle small businesses with higher taxes, expensive mandates and that's change we can't afford."
Yesterday in Denver, Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states. John McCain will continue to discuss his comprehensive blueprint that will create millions of good American jobs, ensure our nation's energy security, get the government's budget and spending practices in order, and bring relief to American consumers.
