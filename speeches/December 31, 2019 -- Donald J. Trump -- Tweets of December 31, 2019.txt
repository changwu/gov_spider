Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday's church attack. It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!Retweets: 39706Favorites: 191167
