    Memorandum for Jay Solomon, Administrator of General Services
Subject: Allegations Regarding Operations of the General Services Administration
Corruption in government is intolerable. For that reason I am deeply disturbed by the allegations of wrongdoing within the General Services Administration that have recently come to my attention.
These allegations describe a pattern of misconduct extending over many years and ranging from abuse of Federal authority to criminal practices such as fraud. If these charges are true, an extremely serious breach of the public trust has occurred.
I support and commend the steps you have taken so far to bring this matter to light and to bring those responsible to justice. I will back you fully in whatever procedural, personnel, organizational, and other actions are needed.
To these ends, by copy of this memorandum, I am asking the Attorney General to provide you with whatever assistance you and others in GSA who are responsible for conducting these investigations may require, both to complete your investigations and to take appropriate and rapid remedial measures.
JIMMY CARTER
