The cost of a border wall is nothing compared to the hundreds of billions we spend year after year providing services and benefits to illegal immigrants. A detailed plan to obtain funding from remittance payments and other proposals to make Mexico pay for the border wall can be seen here: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/pay-for-the-wall
