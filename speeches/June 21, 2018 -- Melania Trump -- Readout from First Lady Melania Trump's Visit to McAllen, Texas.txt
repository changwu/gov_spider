    First Lady Melania Trump traveled to McAllen, Texas today to visit children at Upbring New Hope Children's Center, a nonprofit social services center that is a grantee of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Reform. The First Lady had also planned to visit children and families at the customs and border patrol processing center, but was unable due to severe weather.
The First Lady was accompanied by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Upon arrival at Upbring New Hope, Mrs. Trump was met by the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Kurt Senske and Program Director Roy De La Cerda.
Mrs. Trump participated in a roundtable discussion with leaders and staff of Upbring New Hope and asked questions about the children currently at the shelter and the shelter's overall operations. Mrs. Trump also toured the facility, visiting children's bedrooms, a medical room, and three classrooms to speak with children.
"Today's visit impacted me greatly," said First Lady Melania Trump. "I was very impressed with the center and the hardworking staff and leadership there â€“ and thank them for all of their hard work. The children were eager to learn and were kind and in good spirits. Spending time with them reinforces the fact that these kids are in this situation as a direct result of adult actions. It is my hope that Members of Congress will finally reach across the aisle and work together to solve this problem with common sense immigration reform that secures our borders and keeps families together."
