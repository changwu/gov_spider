    The Clinton campaign today announced that Washington State Congressman Norm Dicks endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. The endorsement comes in the middle of Hillary's two-day swing through Washington. She held a "Solutions for America" rally last night in Seattle and today will host events in Tacoma and Spokane. Rep. Dicks joins Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray as well as Rep. Jay Inslee as members of the Washington congressional delegation endorsing Hillary.
"As the representative of the Tacoma, Bremerton and the Olympic Peninsula, I know that we need a leader who can get our economy back on track and make sure that port cities like Tacoma stay safe," said Congressman Dicks. "Hillary Clinton has the experience to solve our nation's challenges. She will take the steps needed to make homeland security a priority and fix our economy so that all families can participate in the American Dream."
Congressman Norm Dicks, a native of Bremerton, Washington, was first elected to Congress in November 1976. Rep. Dicks currently serves as the third-ranking member of that House Appropriations Committee. At the outset of the 110th Congress he was elected Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee which places him in a leadership position on federal environmental and natural resource policies as well as Indian Affairs. He also serves as a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security.
"I am honored to have the support of Congressman Dicks. His leadership on economic development and protecting the environment has benefited not only his constituents but our nation as a whole," said Clinton. "I look forward to working with him as President to fix the economy and make the change our country needs."
