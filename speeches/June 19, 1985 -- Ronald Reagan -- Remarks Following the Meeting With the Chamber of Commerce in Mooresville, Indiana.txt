    The President. I understand that you were hearing out here what was going on inside.
Audience. Yea!
The President. Well, I hope we answered all of your questions on the tax bill. And if you feel like writing letters to people in Congress to tell them how you feel about the bill, it'd sure be helpfulâ€”or a wire, mailgram.
But thank you all. We've got to go down now and speak to the convention in Indianapolis, but thank you all for being out here. It's been wonderful to be back in the heart of America.
Thank you all.
