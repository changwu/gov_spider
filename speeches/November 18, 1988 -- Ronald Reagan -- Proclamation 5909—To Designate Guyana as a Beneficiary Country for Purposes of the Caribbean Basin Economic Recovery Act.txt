  A Proclamation

1. Section 212 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2702) authorizes the President to designate the countries, territories, or successor political entities thereto that will be beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.). Such countries are entitled to duty-free entry of eligible articles imported directly therefrom into the customs territory of the United States. I am now adding Guyana to the list of beneficiary countries. I have notified the House of Representatives and the Senate of my intention to designate this country and communicated to them the considerations entering into my decision.
2. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483) confers authority upon the President to embody in the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder. Section 1204(b)(1) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-418) directs the President to proclaim such modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), as enacted by section 1204 of that Act, as are necessary or appropriate to implement the applicable provisions of Executive actions taken after January 1, 1988, and before the effective date of the HTS.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to sections 211 through 213 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, and section 1204 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, do proclaim that:
(1) General headnote 3(e)(vii)(A) to the TSUS, listing those countries designated as beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA, is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence "Guyana".
(2) General note 3(c)(v)(A) to the HTS, listing those countries designated as beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA, is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence "Guyana".
(3) (a) The amendment made by paragraph (1) of this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after November 24, 1988.
(b) The amendment made by paragraph (2) of this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 1989.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.

RONALD REAGAN
