    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Oakar (D) OH and 14 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 4825, but has reservations, believing that direct payment of nonphysician health care providers should be left to market forces and not mandated by statute as proposed by H.R. 4825.
