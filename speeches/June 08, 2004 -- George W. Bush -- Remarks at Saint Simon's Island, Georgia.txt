    Thank you all very much for working at what you're doing. It's a great example of Federal, State, and local cooperation. I appreciate many of you taking time away from your families to make sure this event goes the way we want it to go, secure and peaceful. I know that you're working long hours, and I've come to thank you very much for what you're doing. It means a lot to me, and it means a lot to the people whose lives you're protecting.
So I want to thank you very much, and I ask for God's blessings on you all and the country. Thank you very much.
