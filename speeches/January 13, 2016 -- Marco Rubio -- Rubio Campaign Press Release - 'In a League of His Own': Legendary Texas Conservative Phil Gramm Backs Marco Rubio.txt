Phil Gramm is an icon for conservatives, especially in Texas.
Gramm, an economist and former Senator, "stands in a league of his own" in Texas, Rick Perry has said.Now Gramm has made his choice for President. It's Marco:

Here's how he explained his pick:
Number one, he can win this election, and I think it is vitally important that we elect a conservative Republican to take the President's place and undo the Obama programs. Secondly, I think he has the judgment, the wisdom, the foreign policy experience. I think he's right on terrorism. His economics are good. I think he will appoint good people.
Gramm joins a growing number of Texans supporting Marco because of his solid commitment to national security and his optimistic vision.
