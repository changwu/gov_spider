As voters head to the polls across the country, "Por Trump" will remind Hispanics of the President's record of accomplishments for our communities and why they should vote to re-elect him.
"Our latest ad captures the richness and beauty of America's diverse Hispanic cultures while illustrating why President Trump's Latino support continues to grow. We love our families and the President's record of achieving the lowest poverty levels and highest salaries ever for our communities has made it possible for more Hispanics to achieve the American Dream. In a second term, President Trump will build upon his accomplishments with an agenda that includes creating 10 million jobs; protecting our neighborhoods by investing in the police and secure borders; eradicating the coronavirus; and ensuring that all parents can send their children to good schools," said Trump campaign spokesman Giancarlo Sopo.
"Por Trump" will be seen in key markets across the United States.
