    On behalf of all Americans, I want to congratulate the people of South Africa on the start of the 3-day elections now taking place in their country. Today's images of South Africans— black and white—going to the polls in the face of intimidation by vicious opponents of democracy inspire the imagination and are a stern rebuke to the cynics of the world.
South Africans are taking control of their own destinies and preparing to tackle the fundamental challenges of establishing a government of national unity, restoring stability and prosperity, and improving the lives of the South African people. I am proud of the role so many Americans have played in the struggle against apartheid. I can assure South Africans that we will be just as involved in helping to build the nonracial democracy that can come in its wake.
