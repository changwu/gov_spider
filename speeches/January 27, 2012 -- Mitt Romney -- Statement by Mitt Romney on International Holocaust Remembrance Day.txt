    Mitt Romney made the following statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day:
"On this day, we pause to remember the millions of Jews murdered in Europe.Â  But it is not enough merely to reflect on those horrors and the evil that brought it about. We must also reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that there will never be a recurrence of such terrible events. At a moment when the state of Israel is under threat from violent terrorists, from tyrants seeking nuclear weapons, and from a campaign to deny the legitimacy of a Jewish state, the United States must stand shoulder to shoulder with our ally in its quest for peace and security."
