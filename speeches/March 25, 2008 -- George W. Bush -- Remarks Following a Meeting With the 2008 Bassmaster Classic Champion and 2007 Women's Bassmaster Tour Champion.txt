    The President. I've got the fishing champs from this year. And, Judy, thanks for coming.
Judy Wong. Oh, thank you.
The President. She is from Many, Louisiana. She won the Women's Bassmaster. And Alton Jones from Waco, Texas, won the Bassmaster Classic.
And I thought it was important to welcome these champs here to the White House so that—you know, to encourage people to fish. There's nothing better than fishing. I had a fantastic experience with Alton and our friend Charlie Pack. He was a famous local fisherman, and he said, "Do you want to go fishing with a fellow named Jones?" I said: "I've never heard of him. There's a lot people named Jones." [Laughter] It turns out, the man I was fishing with is the—wins the Bassmaster Classic.
This is a good, clean sport. It's a sport that requires good conservation in order to make sure our fisheries are good. And I love welcoming the champs here. And so we're glad you're here.
Ms. Wong. Thank you.
The President. The people in Louisiana and Texas are proud of you.
Alton Jones. Well, it's an honor to be here. You know, fishing with you, I've got to say that President Bush is actually a very good fisherman and a great conservationist. And I'm really not sure who's working who here. I'm hoping to get an invite to fish on his lake in Crawford.
The President. That's right.
Mr. Jones. And he's looking for a free fishing guide. [Laughter]
Ms. Wong. I would be glad to take you any day on Toledo Bend.
The President. That's good.
Ms. Wong. Okay.
The President.Well, thank you, Judy.
Ms. Wong. And bring Laura as well.
The President. Well, yes, she's—I'm a good fisherman; sometimes I'm a good catcher-man. [Laughter]
Mr. Jones. There's a big difference.
The President. Yes, there is. Anyway, thank you all for coming.
