Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota is a rancher, farmer, and small business owner.
So she knows pretty well how Washington is getting in the way of farmers — new taxes, burdensome regulations, and more. But there's hope.

In a new op-ed she says Marco has the right ideas to make American farmers the most competitive in the world:
As President, Marco will make sure we support our farmers and ranchers. He will carry out a conservative agenda that gets the federal government off the backs of small businesses. He supports repealing the death tax that hit our family when tragedy struck and will reform our tax code to create jobs across America.
Marco has also promised to take a stand against environmental regulations perpetuated by the Obama administration that target farmers, including the controversial "Waters of the U.S." land grab.  He will stop regulators from using the Endangered Species Act to further their influence and control. He'll replace bureaucracy with a common-sense approach, making institutional changes that limit the cost of regulations and save you money.
