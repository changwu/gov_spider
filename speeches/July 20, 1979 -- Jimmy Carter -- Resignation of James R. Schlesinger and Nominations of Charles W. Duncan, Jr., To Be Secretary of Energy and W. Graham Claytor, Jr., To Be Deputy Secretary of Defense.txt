    As you know, Secretary of Energy Schlesinger has twice asked the President to accept his resignation. As you also know, Secretary Schlesinger has previously stated his intention to leave the Department of Energy by the fall of this year. The President will nominate Deputy Secretary of Defense Charles William Duncan, Jr., to succeed Secretary Schlesinger. Additionally, the President will nominate W. Graham Claytor, Jr., Secretary of the Navy, to succeed Mr. Duncan as Deputy Secretary of Defense.
The exact date of Secretary Schlesinger's departure will be determined by the President and Secretary Schlesinger, consistent with the mutual desire for a smooth transition. Until that time the Secretary will continue to have the President's full confidence and support.
Mr. Duncan, who has served as Deputy Secretary of Defense since the beginning of this administration, has proven to be a manager of exceptional skill at the Department of Defense. Prior to entering Government service, he had extensive experience in managing some of the largest public and private enterprises in the world. The President feels that Mr. Duncan will provide the sort of leadership that is needed in our continuing efforts to deal with our energy problems.
