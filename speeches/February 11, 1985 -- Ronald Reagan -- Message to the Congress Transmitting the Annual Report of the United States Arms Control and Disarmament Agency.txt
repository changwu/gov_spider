    To the Congress of the United States:
The security of our people, the primary responsibility of the Federal government, is accomplished through the complementary objectives of a strong defense capability and unambiguous and credible arms control agreements. While we have made substantial progress in rebuilding our defenses during the past four years, progress in arms control has not kept pace.
It is my intention in the next four years to do everything possible to find practical arrangements with the Soviet Union that will sharply reduce nuclear weapons. Arms control negotiations are surely the best way for pursuing such important objectives, and thus, I view with the utmost seriousness the negotiating commitments made with the Soviet Union four weeks ago in Geneva. We are now prepared to address not only nuclear offensive systems, but also strategic defenses and the essential improvements in verification.
In addition to these new bilateral arms control efforts, a number of multilateral activities play significant roles in our comprehensive arms control program. For example, discussions are being directed to banning chemical weapons and to reaching agreement on measures that will build confidence in understanding the activities and intentions of adversaries. This 24th Annual Report of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency describes these and all the many facets of the Administration's 1984 program. I am pleased to forward it to the Congress.
