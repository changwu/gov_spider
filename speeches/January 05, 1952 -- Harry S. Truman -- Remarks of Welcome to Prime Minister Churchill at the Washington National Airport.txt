    Mr. Prime Minister, I can't tell you when I have had more pleasure than I have this morning in welcoming you as a visitor to the United States of America.
I hope you will enjoy your visit. I hope that it will be a satisfactory one.
Great Britain and the Commonwealths and the United States are the closest of friends, and you and I want to keep it that way. And I am sure that we will succeed in doing that.
It is a pleasure, sir, to welcome you to Washington, D.C.
[At this point Prime Minister Churchill responded briefly. The President then resumed speaking.]
Peace on earth is what we are both striving for.
