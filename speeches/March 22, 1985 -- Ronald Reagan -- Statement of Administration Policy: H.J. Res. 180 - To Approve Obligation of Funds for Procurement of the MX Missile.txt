    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
The Administration strongly supports H.J. Res 180.
The procurement of Peacekeepers is essential to enhance deterrence and to maintain crucial options for restoring survivability of our land based ICBMS in a cost effective manner in years ahead. The President has concluded that should the House decide to terminate the Peacekeeper's production and deployment, the result would be a significant reduction in our chances to reach a meaningful arms control agreement with the Soviet Union.
