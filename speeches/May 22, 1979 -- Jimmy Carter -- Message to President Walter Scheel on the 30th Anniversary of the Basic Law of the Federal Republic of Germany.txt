    Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, adopted in Bonn on May 23, 1949, I wish to extend to you and to the people of the Federal Republic the very best wishes of the United States of America. The Basic Law has proved itself throughout a difficult and challenging generation of reconstruction and growth as the foundation of one of the most stable and flourishing democratic states in the world. The central place it provides for fundamental human rights and the democratic institutional framework it established have been translated into living practice by your government and people.
The relationship between the Federal Republic and the United States, resting in important part on the democratic vitality which your Basic Law provides, has gathered strength and dynamism over the years. Emerging from a period of turmoil and reconstruction, we entered more than 20 years ago into an alliance partnership which, though it has served its defensive purposes well, has proved to be far more than just a military pact. It has established a framework for mutual understanding and for recognition of the values we share and wish to preserve. In recent years our partnership has acquired a new dimension as a result of the impressive growth in strength and influence of the Federal Republic. My visit to Germany last year and the forthcoming visit of Chancellor Schmidt to the United States symbolize the warmth of German-American relations and the importance of our consultations on crucial international issues.
With congratulations and warm wishes,
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
