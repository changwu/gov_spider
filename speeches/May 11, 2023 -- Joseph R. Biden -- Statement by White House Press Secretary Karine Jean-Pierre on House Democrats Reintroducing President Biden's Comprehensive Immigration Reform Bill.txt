    On his first day in office President Biden sent Congress a proposal to fix our broken immigration system that this administration inherited. We applaud Congresswoman Linda SÃ¡nchez and House Democrats for reintroducing this legislation to responsibly manage and secure our border, keep families and communities safe, and better manage migration across the Western Hemisphere. Instead of coming to the table to work together, House Republicans are playing politics and engaging in stunts that would fail to solve the challenges at our border, while also pushing deep spending cuts that would fire over 2,000 border patrol agents and decrease our border security.
