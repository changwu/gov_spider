I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress an estimate of appropriation for the Department of Labor for salaries and expenses, Bureau of Immigration, for the fiscal year 1932, amounting to $500,000, which is supplemental to the estimate of $10,117,740 contained in the Budget for the fiscal year 1932 as increased by the supplemental estimate of $500,000 transmitted to Congress on January 9, 1931.
The details of this estimate, the necessity therefor, and the reason for its transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
Respectfully,
