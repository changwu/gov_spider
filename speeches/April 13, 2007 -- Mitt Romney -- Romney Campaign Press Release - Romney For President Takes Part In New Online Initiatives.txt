You Choose '08 Spotlight On YouTube:
Governor Romney is the first 2008 presidential candidate to participate in the You Choose '08 Spotlight in a completely unprecedented use of video on the web. Rarely do presidential candidates have the chance to communicate with such a large number of voters and directly solicit their ideas and input. Governor Romney is using his week in the spotlight to ask the YouTube community what they believe is the single greatest challenge facing America and what they would do about it. By the end of his spotlighted week, Governor Romney will record additional web videos with his thoughts on the numerous video responses that are already being submitted.

In anticipation of Tax Day, Governor Romney has partnered with Yahoo! to ask the Yahoo! Answers community how they would change the tax code to ease the burden on families and promote growth and innovation. Governor Romney's question, coupled with a video on his tax philosophy, has been featured on the homepage of Yahoo!, the most visited web site on the Internet, and will receive thousands - if not tens of thousands - of answers.
