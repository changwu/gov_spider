    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am herewith submitting a bimonthly report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Since my last report (August 18, 1983), the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots have responded privately to an initiative undertaken by UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar in early August to promote the resumption of the intercommunal talks which have been suspended since May of this year. At the same time, Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash proposed a meeting between himself and President Kyprianou with the Secretary General. The Secretary General is examining the responses and proposals with a view toward bringing both sides back to the conference table.
The Administration's policy throughout the period under review has been one of continued active support for the Secretary General's role, including his August initiative. We have assured the Secretary General and the two Cypriot communities that we support the early resumption of the talks to focus on the substantive issues separating the two communities.
Our activities over the period have included high-level meetings between senior State Department officials and leaders of both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community. In addition, we have reiterated to both the Government of Greece and Government of Turkey our strong desire to see substantive progress in the intercommunal negotiating process.
During the period since my last report, Secretary Shultz's Special Cyprus Coordinator, Christian A. Chapman, retired from the Foreign Service. Richard Haass was appointed by the Secretary to replace Mr. Chapman. Assistant Secretary Burt and Mr. Haass will appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee soon to outline the present situation on the island and to describe the Administration's Cyprus policy.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
