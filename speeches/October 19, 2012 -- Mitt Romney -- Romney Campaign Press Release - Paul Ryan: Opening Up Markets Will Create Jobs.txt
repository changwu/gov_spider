Florida competes internationally. We want to open up markets. We want to open up trade. We want to lower barriers." â€” Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "And we have, you know, about half of our college graduates these days are either not working in the field they study or are working at all. And so when you have chronic high unemployment, long-lasting unemployment and young people coming out of school with no opportunities, we have a serial problem that needs to be fixed. And it seems to me that entrepreneurship and small businesses is the critical component of that because that's where most of our jobs come from. So it seems to us, clear the barriers, reduce the hurdles that make it hard for small businesses to be viable and internationally competitive, especially in Florida. Florida competes internationally. We want to open up markets. We want to open up trade. We want to lower barriers. We want to make it easier for entrepreneurs to get capital and to compete by having a competitive tax system, to having an immigration system that means we can keep talent in America and open up markets to sell our products overseas."
