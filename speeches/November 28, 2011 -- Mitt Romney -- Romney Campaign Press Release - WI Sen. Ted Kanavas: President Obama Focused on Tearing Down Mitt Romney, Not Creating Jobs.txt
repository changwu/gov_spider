    Former Wisconsin State Senator and Romney for President Wisconsin State Co-Chair Ted Kanavas made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's advertisement and press conference call in Wisconsin:
"President Obama's policies have failed to create jobs in Wisconsin and have devastated the middle class. The last thing that President Obama and his campaign want to do is run against Mitt Romney and be held accountable for the economic failures of the last three years. So, instead of trying to create jobs for the middle class, President Obama and his campaign have focused on tearing down Mitt Romney."
