    The people of the United States were saddened to learn of the passing of former President Glafcos Clerides on Friday. Throughout his life, President Clerides was devoted to the highest principles of public service, human rights, international cooperation, and peace. With courage and commitment, he helped to lead his country first to its independence and later, amidst the violence of 1974, to the restoration of constitutional order. The American people will never forget the profound personal sympathy and support he offered on the day in 1974 that U.S. Ambassador Rodger Davies and his Cypriot assistant Antoinette Varnava were shot and killed in the American Embassy. We also will long remember President Clerides' tireless work to heal the division of Cyprus and to bring the island into the European Union. His vision, resolve, and dignity in these noble tasks were unexcelled. President Obama and the people of the United States extend our heartfelt condolences on his passing.
