in town WH pool report 1 - Good Morning
Good morning from the Trump White House in Washington, DC, where it is currently a mostly sunny, 42-degree morning. On Capitol Hill today, lawmakers appear on track to soon make Donald J. Trump, the former host of Celebrity Apprentice who is also the soon-to-be former president, the only POTUS in history to be impeached twice by the House. Currently, the president has no items listed on today's public schedule released by the White House press office, except for the now-boilerplate claim of: "President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."
Your pooler has taken a COVID-19 test at the White House earlier this hour. We are one week out from the end of the Trump era, with President-elect and obvious winner of the 2020 election Joe Biden's inauguration set for Jan. 20. As of 10:42 a.m. ET on Wednesday, President Trump has yet to acknowledge that he clearly got beat fair and square.

I confirmed with Chris Sheridan, AJ English White House producer who was out there at the time, that the U.S. Marine indeed came outside around 12:15 p.m. ET, to stand guard outside the West Wing entrance, typically indicating President Trump was in the Oval Office.
At around 12:25 p.m. ET today, the same Marine went back indoors.

Shortly before 1:12 p.m. ET today, the U.S. Marine, standing guard outside the West Wing entrance, was spotted again by reporters. This typically means President Trump is back in the Oval Office.

At 1:25 p.m. ET, the aforementioned U.S. Marine was back at post outside. You know the drill.
Note: If these emails aren't helpful, feel free to let me know directly. It is a quiet day thus far, and I'm trying to keep you aware of President Trump's ongoings as much as possible, even if it is as vague as Oval Office appearances.

At 4:28 p.m. ET today, your pooler once again spotted the U.S. Marine had returned to the post outside the entrance to the West Wing. This typically happens when President Trump is in the Oval Office. As that happened, the U.S. House was wrapping up its vote on impeaching Donald J. Trump for a second time in roughly a year.
Shortly after 4:35 p.m. ET, the House made Donald Trump the only president in American history to have been impeached twice.
