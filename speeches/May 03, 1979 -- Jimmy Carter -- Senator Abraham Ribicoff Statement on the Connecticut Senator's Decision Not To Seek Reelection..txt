    Over the past two generations, Senator Abraham Ribicoff has compiled a distinguished career of public service that can serve as a model of decency, compassion, and ability. As a Senator, he has had the vision to take unpopular stands that are vindicated by subsequent events. His courage, leadership, and counsel have helped to pave the way for peace between Israel and Egypt.
Senator Ribicoff and I both share a deep concern about government efficiency. As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, he has shepherded through the Senate a series of proposals to reorganize and streamline the Federal Government. On the Senate Finance Committee, he has been one of the architects of our tax laws and has fought to see that the elderly and the disadvantaged receive the benefits they need and deserve.
Rosalynn and I wish Senator Ribicoff and his wife, Casey, health and happiness in the years ahead.
