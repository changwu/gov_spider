"I am honored to have such a strong group of committed conservatives in Ohio," said Mitt Romney.Â  "As Americans make a critical decision about the future direction of this country, Ohio will be an important state. This team will help me reach out to voters and spread my pro-jobs, pro-growth message across the Buckeye State."
"Mitt Romney will provide the type of conservative leadership that we need to spur economic growth and create jobs," said Senator Rob Portman.
