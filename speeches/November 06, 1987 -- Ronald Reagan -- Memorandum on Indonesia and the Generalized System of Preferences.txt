    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to section 504(c)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(3)), I am hereby waiving the application of section 504(c) with respect to lawn tennis balls provided for in item 734.85 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States. I have received the advice of the United States International Trade Commission as to any industries in the United States that would likely be adversely affected by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Act, that such a waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
