    I WOULD like to say to the President that I wish my visit were long enough to visit all of the major States in Yugoslavia, but since I had to select two, naturally I wanted to pay my respects to the President of Serbia, the largest State, and then, of course, to Croatia, the second largest State.
I was very interested to learn that your country, this country, is somewhat like ours in that respect, that while it is one country, Yugoslavia, that the States are very competitive, what we call friendly competition, between Serbia and Croatia. for the businesses, the new businesses. I think that's good. We have a lot of that in' our country. It exists in California.
