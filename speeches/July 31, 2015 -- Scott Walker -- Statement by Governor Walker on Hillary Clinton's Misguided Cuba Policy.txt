    Shenandoah, Iowa â€“ Today, after Hillary Clinton's speech in Miami, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on her misguided Cuba policy:
"Hillary Clinton's support of this administration's misguided Cuba policy is further evidence that if she is elected, she will be nothing more than a third term of the Obama presidency.
"When President Clinton signed the embargo against Cuba into federal statute, it was in response to the Castro regime's oppressive treatment of the Cuban people, its despotic grip on power, and rampant corruption. Nothing has changed. These problems still remain. And yet, the Obama-Clinton policy is to reward the Castro brothers, provide them with a financial lifeline, and turn a blind eye to their egregious human rights violations.
"Americans deserve a leader who won't make sweetheart deals with dictators, and as president, my approach to Cuba would be the opposite of President Obama and Hillary Clinton's failed policy. That means leveraging our strength to advance U.S. interests, facilitate greater economic and democratic freedoms for the Cuban people, and secure relief for those harmed by the Castro regime's oppression."
