    Today on the heels of the Charlotte Observer's endorsement, Former North Carolina Governor Jim Martin endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President.
"Governor Kasich can win in November against Hillary Clinton," said Martin. "He has the temperament, the experience and the leadership qualities we need in the White House. He will be the president that our nation will be proud of. I am excited to stand behind him, and I call on fellow North Carolinians who are frustrated with Washington gridlock to do the same. We can expect and trust Kasich to listen and bring results."

Governor Jim Martin was elected in 1984 and served until 1993. Previously, he was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1973-1984.
Said Kasich, "As Governor, Jim Martin was a strong leader and a dedicated public servant. He is a model for leadershipâ€” not only because under his administration North Carolina saw unprecedented job growth but because of his personal drive to advance solutions that improved the lives of his constituents. It is an honor to have his endorsement."
