    We have seen the statement this afternoon declaring a freeze of the sentence issued earlier against hostage Joseph Cicippio. We regard this as an encouraging and hopeful development, but it still does not answer our continuing concern for release of all hostages. We urge that all parties in the region use whatever influence they have to end the tragedy of hostage taking and to release those remaining in captivity. And we express our appreciation to all those who have been thus far trying to help.
