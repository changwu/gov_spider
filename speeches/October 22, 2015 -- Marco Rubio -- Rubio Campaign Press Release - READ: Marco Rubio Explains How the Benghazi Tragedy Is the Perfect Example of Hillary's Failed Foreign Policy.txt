Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi about her role in the 2012 terrorist attack in Libya that resulted in the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens, the first U.S. Ambassador in 35 years to be killed in the line of duty. Three other Americans, Sean Smith, Ty Woods, and Glen Doherty, were killed as well.
Americans deserve to learn the truth about Clinton's actions as Secretary of State in the days and weeks before the death of these brave Americans.
Yet the debate about Clinton's precise role in the Benghazi disaster should not obscure a broader point that is obvious to most observers: Hillary Clinton's failed record as Secretary of State, like the Obama administration's disastrous foreign policy, has made America less safe at home and abroad.
In the case of Benghazi, despite her advocacy of the intervention that resulted in the fall of a brutal dictator, Clinton appeared to show little interest in the deteriorating situation in Libya.
