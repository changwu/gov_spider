    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit a communication + received this day from the late Postmaster-General, to which I invite your careful attention.
+Relating to fraudulent bonds accompanying certain bids and contracts for carrying United States Mail.
Though the period limited for the reception of bids under the existing advertisement expires on the 7th instant, several weeks must necessarily elapse before they can be classified and examined and the actual letting take place.
If, therefore, Congress shall be of the opinion that a change in the law is needed, it may, I presume, be made immediately applicable.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
