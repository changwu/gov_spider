    Campaign raises nearly $1.1M in just over one month, more than $630K in four days following debate
NEW YORKâ€”De Blasio 2020 announced a major staff expansion today following a successful fundraising effort in its abbreviated second quarter, growing its New York headquarters and adding staff in Iowa and South Carolina.
Mayor de Blasio raised nearly $1.1 million during the final six weeks of the second fundraising quarter following his entry into the presidential race and finished with $728,000 on hand, of which 92% of his contributions were $50 or less. His campaign's small burn rate of roughly 30% will ensure it has the necessary resources.
Thanks to its fundraising success, de Blasio 2020 added new staffers nationwide to strengthen every component of the campaign. New additions include:

Jaclyn Rothenberg, National Press Secretary
Will Baskin-Gerwitz, Communications Advisor
Jess Moore Matthews, Digital Director
Lachlan McIntosh, South Carolina Senior Advisor and former Executive Director of the South Carolina Democratic Party
Lance Jones, South Carolina State Director
Bre Spaulding, South Carolina Political Director
Cameron Macaw-Hennick, Iowa Field Director

"These hires are a direct result of the fundraising success we've had in just a few short weeks, and our growth is a sign of what's to come moving forward," said Jon Paul Lupo, Senior Advisor to the campaign. "We're grateful to every supporter who chipped in because they share Mayor de Blasio's message of putting working people first and we're going to continue spreading that message to voters across the country."
The campaign saw a major increase in momentum following Mayor de Blasio's impressive showing in the first Democratic primary debate. In just four days, de Blasio 2020 raised more than $630,000, capitalizing off a performance where Chris Matthews called Mayor de Blasio a "surprise heavyweight" and the Washington Post labeled him a "winner" of the first night of debates.
