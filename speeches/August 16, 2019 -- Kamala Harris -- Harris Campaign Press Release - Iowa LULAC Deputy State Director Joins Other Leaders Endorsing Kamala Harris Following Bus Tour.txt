    In the wake of Senator Kamala Harris' 5-day, river-to-river bus tour, Iowa LULAC Deputy State Director, Davenport area LULAC Council 10 President, and Iowa ACLU Board Member Jazmin Newton-Butt announced her endorsement of Harris for president.
Newton-Butt's announcement follows other recent prominent endorsements, including Des Moines School Board Member and teacher librarian Kyrstin Delagardelle, the Asian & Latino Coalition of Iowa, and Iowa powerhouses Sue and Bob Dvorsky.
"Kamala understands the issues that Americans face today and I strongly believe she is prepared to fight for all of us," Newton-Butt said. "She exemplifies the strong moral character and work ethic this country needs. I look forward to working with her team to get help get Sen. Harris to the White House."
Newton-Butt joined Harris on the final stop of the bus tour and took part in a roundtable on July 16 that Harris organized to focus on issues that impact women of color in the Davenport area where State Rep. Phyllis Thede also endorsed. Newton-Butt is an active member of the community, serving as a Commissioner for the City of Davenport and on the Board of Directors for the Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce.
Jazmin's support of Harris represents her personal views, and not those of the organizations she represents.
