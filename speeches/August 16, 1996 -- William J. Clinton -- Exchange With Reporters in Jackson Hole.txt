    Republican Convention
Q. Mr. President, what did you think of Dole's speech last night?
The President. I didn't watch it. I haven't watched any of it.
Q. How come?
The President. Because I've been on vacation. I want to let them have their convention. I'm looking forward to ours.
President's Vacation
Q. Are you enjoying your stay here?
The President. Oh, I'm having a wonderful time, thank you.
Chelsea Clinton's Rock Climbing
Q. I was the ranger with Chelsea yesterday.
She's a good climber.
The President. Were you there with her?
Q. Yes.
The President. She loved it. You know, she loves that so much.
Q. She looked pretty good.
The President. She loves to do it. And I think she'd really like to take some more training. She spent 30 days out here in the West last summer, and she did some climbing. She was in the mountains; she was in valleys and rivers; she did a lot of work. I think she'd like to get pretty serious about this climbing business. She's strong, and she's flexible.
Q. Her mother might not be that interested.
The President. She's strong, and she's flexible and—what?
Q. Her mother might not be that interested.
The President. Yes, but she's a pretty prudent person. She's pretty safe. But I think if you're strong and flexible and have good balance—all that ballet training prepared her.
Q. Yes.
The President. Well, thanks for saying that.
Republican Convention
Q. Mr. President, since you didn't see the speech would you like us to tell you about it? [Laughter]
The President. I have an idea that you would edit in a way designed to elicit a response. And I wouldn't want to see it in the paper the next day. [Laughter]
Q. There's a risk of that.
The President. Come on, we can afford to have 2 more days of enjoyment, then we can go back and deal with all that. [Laughter]
