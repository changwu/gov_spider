"You can only win the state of Colorado by more than 18 points if you get the support of the state's Latino community in a big way," said Arturo Carmona, Sanders' deputy political director. "Last night's victory is the result of organizers working on the ground to engage the community and deliver Sen. Sanders' message of fixing a rigged economy."
Sanders carried Colorado with sizable margins of victory in the most dense Latino regions. Adams, Weld and Denver counties are home to 43 percent of the Latino Democrats in the state. He won Adams County by 23 percent, Weld County by 22 percent and Denver County by 10 percent.
"Latinos will play a pivotal role in Sen. Sanders' path to victory in important states like Arizona, Illinois, New York, California and Florida and we're confident he can continue to win in battleground states with their help," Carmona said.
