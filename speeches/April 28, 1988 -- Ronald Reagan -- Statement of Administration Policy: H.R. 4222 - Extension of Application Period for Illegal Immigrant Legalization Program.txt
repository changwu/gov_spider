    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Rep. Mazzoli (D) Kentucky)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4222 and the Attorney General will recommend that the President veto the bill if it is presented to him.
The Administration opposes extending the period during which certain aliens illegally in the country can apply for legalization, pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, because any such extension would: (1) not increase significantly the number of applications submitted, (2) increase the cost of the legalization program, and (3) undermine the basic consensus reached in enacting the landmark immigration reform legislation and create further expectations of additional changes or extensions to the legalization program.
