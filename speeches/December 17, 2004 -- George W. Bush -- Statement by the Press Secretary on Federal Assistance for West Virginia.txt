    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of West Virginia that was impacted by severe storms, flooding and landslides September 16 - 27, 2004, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures under the Public Assistance program.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued on September 20, 2004, the Federal government was paying 75 percent of the eligible costs to State and affected local governments for debris removal and emergency protective measures. The President's order today authorizes payment of 100 percent Federal share for a period of up to 72 hours.
The cost-share adjustment applies to work performed during a continuous 72-hour period selected by each eligible applicant within the period from September 16, 2004, through October 4, 2004.
