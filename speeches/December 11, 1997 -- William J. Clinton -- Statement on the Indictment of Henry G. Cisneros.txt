    Henry Cisneros has a distinguished career of truly dedicated public service. As mayor of San Antonio, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and as a wise counselor to me, he always has the interest of ordinary people at heart. I have greatly valued his service. This is a matter before the courts, so it is not appropriate for me to comment further.
