    Q. Did you——
The President. It's been a great honor, the honor of a lifetime. The greatest people in the world. The greatest home in the world—I called it a home. We've had an amazing 4 years. We've accomplished a lot. We love the American people. And again, it has been something very special.
And I just want to say goodbye, but hopefully, it's not a long-term goodbye. We'll see each other again.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
