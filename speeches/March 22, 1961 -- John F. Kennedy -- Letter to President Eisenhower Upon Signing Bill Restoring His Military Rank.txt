    Dear Mr. President:
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to inform you that I have today approved the Act of Congress authorizing your appointment to the active list of the Regular Army as General of the Army with your former date of rank in such grade. I have directed that a commission be prepared immediately.
The legislation constitutes a reaffirmation of the affection and regard of our Nation for you.
I have arranged to have an exact copy of the Enrolled Bill made, and it is enclosed herewith.
With every good wish, I am
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
