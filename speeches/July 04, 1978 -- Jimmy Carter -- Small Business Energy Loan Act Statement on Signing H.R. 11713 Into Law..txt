    I am signing today H.R. 11713, the small business energy loan program. This act will provide Federal loans and loan guarantees to small businesses to engage in the design, manufacture, marketing, and installation of solar technologies and energy conservation practices. Senator Thomas Mcintyre and Congressmen Berkley Bedell and Alvin Baldus, the sponsors of this act, have worked hard to set up a framework for assisting small business participation in the important areas of solar energy and energy conservation.
Bringing solar and conservation technologies into wide-scale use will require a strong effort by American small businesses. I am approving this new program because I am disappointed with the past performance of the Small Business Administration in this effort. I am directing the Administrator of the SBA to marshal his authorities under this new program and under existing law to more actively involve small firms in solar energy and energy conservation.
Finally, I would ask the Congress to work with me in ensuring that this new program does not increase our overall budget for the Small Business Administration. I believe the SBA's resources are adequate and that this new program can be funded from within the moneys which I requested in my fiscal year 1979 budget request.
