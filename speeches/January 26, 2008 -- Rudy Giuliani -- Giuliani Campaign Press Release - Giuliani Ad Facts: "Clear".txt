BACKGROUND:
Giuliani "Gets It" On Need For National Catastrophe Fund. "Rudy Giuliani has decisively staked out his position. He supports a national catastrophe fund. He gets it. He understands that sometimes seemingly local issues that affect our pocketbooks are really national issues which demand national attention. He also understands that in some cases, the federal government has a legitimate role to play. In the case of insurance, he understands that states can no longer go it alone." (Peter Monroe and Lloyd Chaisson, Op-Ed, "Ignoring Need For Fund Would Be Disaster," South Florida Sun-Sentinel, 1/25/08)
Tampa Tribune: "Without Question, Giuliani Is Right To Support A National Fund …" (Editorial, "Giuliani's Property Insurance Claim," Tampa Tribune, 1/23/08)
Giuliani Fully Supports Creation Of National Catastrophic Insurance Fund. Mayor Giuliani: "Every community in America must be prepared for natural disasters and terrorist attacks, which is why I support the creation of a National Catastrophe Insurance Fund and why I have made ensuring that every community in America is prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters one of my 12 Commitments to the American People. … Right now, many people in states like Florida, California and Louisiana find it difficult to purchase insurance for catastrophic natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. It's right for the government to play a role in seeing that fair, equitable and affordable private insurance markets are open for all our citizens." (Rudy Giuliani For President, Press Release, 1/10/08)
McCain Said He Opposes National Catastrophe Fund And That FEMA Was "That Insurance Policy." "A national insurance pool has lingered on Florida's wish list due to opposition from disaster-free states. Asked about the proposal, McCain called for improving the Federal Emergency Management Agency, widely panned for its shoddy response after Hurricane Katrina. 'I do not support a national catastrophic insurance policy,' McCain said. 'That insurance policy is there and it's called FEMA and it's called national disaster preparedness. . . . I still do not have confidence that FEMA is capable of handling all of those responsibilities.' Responding to the criticism from the Giuliani camp, a McCain spokeswoman said proposed legislation failed to 'include private insurance reforms to broaden markets and protect against cherry-picking of individual states.' Romney has not endorsed an insurance pool but said he would consider it." (Beth Reinhard, "GOP Courting Florida's Cubans," The Miami Herald, 1/22/08)
Huckabee "Said He'd Have To See The Details" And Questioned Need For Fund. "Asked about a national catastrophe fund to ease the property insurance crisis in Florida and other states, [Huckabee] was receptive but said he'd have to see the details. Rebuilding people's beach homes doesn't appeal to him, but, 'I come from a state that's prone to tornadoes and floods. I understand how devastating it can be, so I'm very sympathetic.'" ("State Is Gaining Clout, GOP Told," St. Petersburg Times, 5/20/07)
Romney Will Only Promise Talk, Not Action On Fund. ROMNEY: "[W]e're going to have to work together to create a program that gets people in high-risk areas insured. Now, I'm not in favor of saying that the people in Iowa should have to subsidize the people in Massachusetts or the people in Florida. That doesn't make a lot of sense. But to have those states that are in high-risk areas come together and say, How do we organize an effort on a national basis that actuarially deals with the differences between different states and the different risks they face and make sure that we have a backstop behind the private insurance industry? That makes a lot of sense. … I do support an effort to get everybody some form of catastrophic coverage. And it may be a public-private partnership between private insurance industries and the federal government. It may be done with the states. But I'll bring together the governors of all 50 states, as well as leadership in Washington, as well as industry representatives, to say, What's the right way to fashion this that makes the most sense for the people of America?"

Government spending has been growing faster than the economy itself. The massive national debt which we accumulated is the result of the government's high spending diet. Well, it's time to change the diet, and to change it in the right way." (President Reagan, Address To Congress, Washington, D.C., 4/28/81)

Giuliani Supports Catastrophe Fund As "Federal Backstop." "Giuliani supports one of the top priorities of Crist and other Florida leaders from both parties: creation of a national fund to help cover catastrophic loses from national disasters. The idea is to spread the risk and limit the liability of insurance companies so they can provide more affordable rates. 'You should have a federal backstop for once-in-a-century catastrophes, once-in-a-decade catastrophes, these horrible things that happen,' he said. He said beneficiaries and state and local governments need to absorb some risk. Noting New York's potential vulnerability to hurricanes and the West Coast's susceptibility to earthquakes, Giuliani said such a program would be good for other parts of the country as well as Florida."

GIULIANI: "I just talked to your Governor about that. Talked to your Governor about it many times. He's explained it to me in great detail. The Attorney General, when he was a candidate, when I supported him, I think it is a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. During the time I was the mayor, my governor, Governor Pataki, had to deal with two really catastrophic ice storms in northern New York. We sent him some help, he did a great job of doing it, but we need that help. The parts of the country that think it only helps Florida, I think are missing all the other natural catastrophes and disasters and maybe they are not hurricanes, but they are all the other things I mentioned."

Mayor Giuliani Threw Yasser Arafat Out Of Concert Held For UN's 50th Anniversary. "Despite criticism from the Clinton administration, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is standing by his decision to throw PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat out of a concert held for the United Nations' 50th anniversary. 'I am comfortable with my decision and very proud of it,' Giuliani said Tuesday, blaming the PLO for the killings of U.S. citizens." (Allyn Fisher, "Mayor Defends Decision To Boot Arafat From Concert," The Associated Press, 10/25/95)
National Review Praised Giuliani's Treatment Of Castro During Dictator's NYC Visits. "Whatever you may think of New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's positions on political issues, it's clear the man has no compunctions about speaking plainly when the occasion requires. The current occasion is the visit to the U.N. by that well-known rescuer of distressed children, Fidel Castro. Said Rudy, when asked whether his city would be extending municipal hospitality to El Jefe: 'Fidel Castro is a murderer.' Earlier he had said, 'I wouldn't invite him anywhere. What Fidel Castro has done to the Cuban people … is an outrage of this century.'" ("The Week," National Review, 9/25/00)
Castro Noted That Giuliani Refused To Invite Him To Dinner While He Was In New York. "[Castro] took delight in recounting the many snubs he has received since his arrival, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's failure to include him in a Saturday night banquet. 'The Mayor said I was a demon and the demon wouldn't be invited to dinner,' Mr. Castro said. 'I'm going hungry on my first day in New York.'" (Lizette Alvarez, "Castro Back In Fatigues, And Harlem," The New York Times, 10/23/95)
Under Giuliani, 18 Members Of New York And Sicilian Mafia Were Convicted For Cocaine And Heroin Smuggling In "Pizza Connection" Case. "Eighteen men were convicted today of operating an international heroin and cocaine ring that distributed more than $1.6 billion in drugs through pizza parlors in the Northeast and Midwest. The convictions of the men, who include former leaders of the Sicilian Mafia and the New York-based Bonnano crime family, follow the convictions late last year of the members of a ruling Mafia commission. 'It is a tremendous victory in the effort to crush the Mafia,' U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said. 'Five years ago nobody would have thought it possible to convict the head of the Sicilian Mafia and the head of a major part of an American Mafia family.' He added, 'The impact on the Mafia of these cases has been devastating. If this continues, there's not going to be a Mafia.'" (Margot Hornblower, "18 Guilty In ‘Pizza Connection' Trial," The Washington Post, 3/3/87)
In 1986, Giuliani Successfully Convicted Three Mafia Godfathers. "Prosecutors and law enforcement agencies are basking in the victory of guilty verdicts for three Mafia godfathers and five associates and stiff sentences for eight other mobsters and associates in the government's steamroller assault on La Cosa Nostra. … The heads of three of New York's five Mafia families were convicted Wednesday. They are: Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno, 75, head of the Genovese clan, who authorities have called the nation's most powerful gangster. He faces 306 years in jail. Carmine 'Junior' Persico, 53, the Colombo family leader, who was sentenced Monday to 39 years in prison on racketeering, extortion and bribery charges and who now faces another 306 years in jail. Anthony 'Tony Ducks' Corallo, 73, the Lucchese family leader, who faces 326 years." (William M. Reilly, "The Mafia Convictions: 'Organized Crime Never Going To Be The Same Again'," United Press International, 11/23/86)

Mayor Giuliani: "The way you deal with terrorists, tyrants, and bullies is you to stand up them. You don't back down."

Military Expert Ralph Peters: "The Best Defense Is A Strong Offense. We Cannot Wait At Home For Terrorists To Strike. We Must Not Waver From The Current Policy Of Taking The War To Our Enemies. The Moment We Falter, Our Enemies Will Bring The War Back To Us." (Ralph Peters, Op-Ed, "Comforting The Enemy," New York Post, 3/25/04)
Terrorism Expert Steve Emerson: "The Best Defense Is A Good Offense. We Need To Basically Be Interrupting The Terrorists On Their Own Turf. That's The Best Protection We Can Do To Protect Ourselves Here." (MSNBC's "Hardball," 10/25/02)
Foundation For The Defense Of Democracies President Cliff May: "The U.S. Has Not Always Responded Seriously When People Said They Wanted To Kill Us. One Of The Simple Lessons Of Sept. 11 Is That We Don't Wait For Terrorists Who Say They Are Going To Kill Us To Do Something And Then Punish Them. We Take Them To War."

Voice Over: "In crisis, the nation looked to Rudy Giuliani for strength and hope. And in our darkest hours, we found it. Only Rudy Giuliani."
Chyron: "ONLY Rudy Giuliani"
BACKGROUND:
St. Petersburg Times: "Few New Yorkers Will Forget The Way Giuliani's Natural Leadership Made Him A Whirlwind Of Instant Decision Making And Crisis Management While So Poignantly Expressing The Collective Grief Of A City And A Nation." (Editorial, "Giuliani Won Many Hearts," St. Petersburg Times, 12/29/01)
Time's Eric Pooley: "With The President Out Of Sight For Most Of That Day, Giuliani Became The Voice Of America. Every Time He Spoke, Millions Of People Felt A Little Better. His Words Were Full Of Grief And Iron, Inspiring New York To Inspire The Nation." (Eric Pooley, "Mayor Of The World," Time, 12/31/01)
• Pooley Said Mayor Giuliani Took On "Half A Dozen Critical Roles" And Performed Each One "Masterfully." "When the day of infamy came, Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life, taking on half a dozen critical roles and performing each masterfully. Improvising on the fly, he became America's homeland-security boss, giving calm, informative briefings about the attacks and the extraordinary response." (Eric Pooley, "Mayor Of The World," Time, 12/31/01)
San Francisco Chronicle Described Giuliani In The Wake Of 9/11 As "Calm, Soothing, And Omnipresent." "Calm, soothing and omnipresent, [Giuliani] gracefully embodies his city's power to endure. Dust-covered and soft-spoken, he traversed the Manhattan dead zone, congratulating exhausted firefighters, holding hands with grieving families and tracking rescue efforts. He became a stand-in leader for every corner of America dazed by the terrorist attacks." (Editorial, "Rudy To The Rescue," San Francisco Chronicle, 9/23/01)
Chicago Tribune Called Giuliani's Leadership In The Immediate Aftermath Of The Attack "Inspiring." "Giuliani deserves all the praise and then some. His instant leadership reflex immediately after the crisis--in an age when some politicians are afraid to come out on the street or in front of a microphone without professional prepping or prompting--was inspiring. He was able to bark orders one moment, console victims the next, empathize publicly to the point of sobbing in front of the television cameras, and preach optimism, all the while reassuring New Yorkers that everything was under control. Or at least as much under control as humanly possible." (Editorial, "Rudy, New York's Rock," Chicago Tribune, 9/24/01)
Washington Times Said That Giuliani Set A "Modern Benchmark for Leadership." "If it could be said that New York got any kind of a break on September 11, it came from the fact that Rudy Giuliani was mayor. His unbowed strength, steady calm and unstinting devotion to the city during this extraordinary crisis has set a modern benchmark for leadership – besides being of immeasurable comfort and aid to the citizens of New York and, indeed, the nation." (Editorial, "The Giuliani Effect," Washington Times, 11/9/01)
Daily News Called Giuliani "Our Tower" And "The Leader We Needed In Our Terrible Hour." "If ever a man had his destiny, Sept. 11 was Giuliani's. The twin towers lay in ruins, the mayor who had returned an "ungovernable" city to its rightful place as capital of the world had nearly perished. Yet here he was, our tower – solid, steady, the leader we needed in our terrible hour. Thank you, Rudy. We will never forget." (Editorial, "The Mayor's Finest Hour," Daily News, 12/27/01)
AD FACT:
Mayor Giuliani: "This is the greatest country in the world. We have the will and the courage and the ideals to ensure the economic and physical safety of every single citizen. All we need is the leadership. And leading in crisis is what I do best."
Voice Over: "ONLY Rudy Giuliani."
Mayor Giuliani: "I'm Rudy Giuliani, I approve this message, and I'm asking for your vote."

• Giuliani Faced Fiscal Crisis When He Took Office In 1994. "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances. Under a tough law passed after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, he will be required to explain in January how he plans to close the gap in the current year's budget, estimated at about $ 400 million. Soon after, he will be required to come up with the outline of his budget for the fiscal year starting next summer, which currently contains a projected $1.5-billion deficit." (Karen Rothmyer, "Giuliani Seen As Good For Business," Newsday, 11/4/93)
• In 1997, There Was Terrorist Plot To Bomb New York Subway Station And Commuter Bus. "Two men with Jordanian passports were arrested yesterday morning in a Brooklyn apartment, where police officers found components of one or more pipe bombs — evidence of what the authorities say was a terrorist plot to detonate bombs in the busy Atlantic Avenue subway station and on a commuter bus. The two suspects were shot after a team of New York City police officers, acting on a tip from a man who lived with the two, burst into the Park Slope apartment an hour before dawn." (Dan Barry, "Bombs In Brooklyn: The Overview," The New York Times, 8/1/97)
Giuliani Served As U.S. Attorney For The Southern District Of New York From 1983-1989. "U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.

• New York City Had A Drug Crisis. Right after coming into office, Giuliani announced a Federal 'sweep' to rid Manhattan's Lower East Side streets of small-time drug dealers. Most Federal prosecutors believe their limited resources for drug enforcement should be concentrated on international cases. They leave the $40 'busts' to local authorities. Not Giuliani. He said his office could do both." (Michael Winerip, "High-Profile Prosecutor," The New York Times, 6/9/85)
• New York City Had Corrupt Politicians Undermining Public Trust. Frontline's Mark Obenhaus: "The revelation that officials as powerful as Donald Manes and Stanley Freidman were corrupt has shaken public confidence in New York City government. The scandal has spawned a wrath of other investigations. During 1986 and 1987, the Commissioners of Hospitals, Taxis, Transportation, Cultural Affairs, Business Development, two members of the City Planning Commission, a borough president and a United States Congressman all resigned or were under indictment."

• Narcotics Trafficking Was Prevalent When Giuliani Became Associate Attorney General. "At the Justice Department, Mr. Giuliani has been highly visible, particularly as one of the chief strategists of the Reagan Administration's stepped-up effort to combat narcotics trafficking. He was instrumental in devising the Reagan budget request of $130 million granted by Congress last year to finance 12 new investigative drug task forces across the nation." (Jane Perlez, "Giuliani Willing To Accept U.S. Attorney Job In State," The New York Times, 3/10/83)
• There Were Over 1.1 Million Violent Crimes Reported In The United States When Reagan Appointed Giuliani To Justice Department Position. "The federal government brings 35,000 criminal cases a year, the majority for property rather than violent crimes. In 1979, the last full year for which the FBI has figures, there were 1,178,540 violent crimes reported to police in the United States. The overwhelming majority of these violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault did not violate federal law. In addition, the federal government has reliable evidence that for each violent crime reported to the police in the United States, two others go unreported." (Michael J. Sniffen, "Top Justice Official Says Rehabilitation Key To Reducing Violent Crime," The Associated Press, 8/19/81)

Robert Blakey, who drafted the RICO statue, says that as early as 1980 he gave a lecture to the FBI suggesting a RICO case against the mob. But Blakey says, 'If Rudy wants to claim credit, I say, give it to him. Because it wouldn't have happened without him.'" (Connie Bruck, "Rudolph Giuliani," The American Lawyer, 3/89)
