    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report a new Department of Commerce deferral of $15.8 million in funds for the International Energy Exposition in Knoxville, Tennessee. In addition, I am reporting a revision to a previously transmitted deferral for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal energy impact fund increasing the amount deferred by $0.5 million.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
