    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sieberling (D) Ohio and 48 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1140 and, if it were presented to the President, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. H.R. 1140 would unnecessarily subject railroads to duplicative and potentially inconsistent regulation by the courts, at a time when the Interstate Commerce Commission is providing continuing and increasing relief for alleged anti-competitive practice.
