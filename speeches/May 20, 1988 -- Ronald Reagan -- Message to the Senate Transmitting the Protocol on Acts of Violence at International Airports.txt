    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on February 24, 1988. The report of the Department of State is also enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The Protocol will extend and supplement the legal framework of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on September 23, 1971, to which the United States is already a party. It provides for enhanced international cooperation in the fight against terrorism at airports serving international civil aviation. The Protocol was negotiated under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The United States played a leading role in the negotiation of the Protocol. Early ratification by the United States will encourage similar action by other nations.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
