    I am pleased that my administration has approved Maryland's request for welfare waivers. This will allow Maryland to put in place a new system of incentives for welfare recipients to make sure their children receive necessary health care and attend school.
Pregnant women receiving welfare would be required to obtain regular prenatal care or not receive a special additional allowance. Families with young children receiving welfare would be required to obtain preventive health care for their children. This prenatal and preventive health care is available without cost to these families through the Medicaid program.
Maryland's reforms also create incentives for parents to make sure their children attend school. Welfare parents who behave responsibly and fulfill these requirements would receive higher payments than those who fail to see to the health care and education of their children.
While some are talking about welfare reform, we are helping to make it happen. Reform is taking place from the bottom up, with the States constructively serving as laboratories of democracy. My administration will continue to work with Maryland and other States in reforming our welfare system.
