Tim Scott:We cannot let states like California, New York, and Illinois have abortions on demand up until the day of birth. That is immoral, it is unethical, it is wrong. We must have a President of the United States who will advocate and fight for at minimum the 15-week limit. I am 100% a pro-life conservative, I have a 100% pro-life record. I gotta tell you, though, we must fight for life. Our Declaration of Independence says our Creator gave us inalienable rights that include life! That is an issue we must solve. We can't leave it to Illinois, we can't leave it to Minnesota. We must solve that issue with a 15-week limit at a minimum.
