    Office of Management and Budget Director-designate Neera Tanden and United States Trade Representative (USTR)-designate Katherine Tai met with leaders of the American labor movement Thursday afternoon for a virtual roundtable focused on the impact of the COVID-19 public health and economic crises on America's labor force, and the continuing need to support American workers and businesses. The participants discussed opportunities to build good labor policy into U.S. trade policies to support the recovery and rebuild an equitable economy.
Director-designate Tanden highlighted the Office of Management and Budget's unique role in this moment, particularly OMB's responsibility to ensure a government that delivers effective, efficient results to help move the country and economy forward. She also discussed the role our nation's budgets and programs play in reflecting our shared values of hard work, fairness, and respect and reiterated her commitment to placing labor at the center of the recovery.
USTR-designate Tai reiterated her and the President-elect's commitment to changing the way we trade, and pursuing trade policies that support and benefit American workers, combat the threat of climate change, fuel American innovation and increase America's competitiveness.
USTR-designate Tai also offered her reflections on lessons learned while working hand in glove with labor as Chief Trade Counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee that will guide her approach to trade enforcement and leveling the playing field for American workers. The labor leaders thanked USTR-designate Tai for years of partnership and for her advocacy on behalf of American workers and offered their partnership and support to the incoming Biden-Harris administration.
