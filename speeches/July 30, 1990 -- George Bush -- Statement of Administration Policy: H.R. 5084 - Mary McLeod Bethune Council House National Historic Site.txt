    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Final/Sent)
(House)(Lewis (D) GA and 26 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5084 which would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire and manage the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site. The National Park Service is currently studying the National Historic Site to determine the suitability and feasibility of adding it to the National Park System. Until this study is completed and reviewed, it would be premature to enact H.R. 5084. Moreover, the National Council of Negro Women, which currently owns and operates the site, already receives technical and monetary assistance from the National Park Service.
