    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Wyoming Senator Craig Thomas. During nearly 23 years of public service as a Senator, Congressman, and State legislator, Senator Thomas was a tireless and effective advocate for the people of his beloved home State. He was a man of character and integrity, known for his devotion to the values he shared with the people of Wyoming. He leaves a lasting legacy as a guardian of Wyoming's lands and resources and our country's national parks. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Senator Thomas's wife Susan, his family, and friends.
