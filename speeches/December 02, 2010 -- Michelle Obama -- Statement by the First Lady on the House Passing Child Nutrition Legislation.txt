    I am so thrilled that the House of Representatives has passed "The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act" – a groundbreaking piece of bipartisan legislation that will significantly improve the quality of meals that children receive at school and will play an integral role in our efforts to combat childhood obesity. I particularly want to commend Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Majority Whip Clyburn, Chairman Miller, and Chairwoman DeLauro for their leadership in ensuring passage of the bill in the House, and I am grateful to all the Senators and House Members who worked so hard in recent months to make this critically important legislation a reality.
Over the past two years, I have had the privilege of speaking with parents, educators, governors and mayors, medical professionals, community and business leaders, and students all across the country – all of whom are determined to ensure that our children have access to the nutritious food they need to learn and grow and fulfill their potential. I'm proud of what we're doing to support these efforts through our Let's Move! initiative, and I am confident that, together, we can turn the tide on childhood obesity and give all our children the happy, healthy lives they deserve.
