    Former Secretary of Education Rod Paige today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks to the NAACP convention:
"Under President Obama, the unemployment rate for African Americans has increased from 12.7 percent to 14.4 percent. Economic stagnation has hurt us more than it has hurt any other group in America. Our community has been taken for granted by Democratic politicians who have not carried through on promises to accelerate our nation's economic recovery. Mitt Romney supports policies that will actually get the economy growing again. It's time to choose a better alternative to the current Administration's failed policies of the last four years."
