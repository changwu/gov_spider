    I am extremely pleased that the Senate unanimously passed legislation today providing an important new health coverage option to low-income, uninsured women with breast cancer. With passage of the "Breast and Cervical Cancer Act of 1999," the Senate has virtually assured that the Congress will present me with legislation that I was pleased to include in this year's budget and that I will be proud to sign into law. I would like to thank my wife, Hillary, for her constant advocacy on behalf of this legislation. Her longstanding advocacy for women with breast cancer is well known and has been the inspiration behind this administration's unwavering commitment to this issue. I look forward to final passage of this important bill and the new security it will provide for thousands of women with breast cancer.
