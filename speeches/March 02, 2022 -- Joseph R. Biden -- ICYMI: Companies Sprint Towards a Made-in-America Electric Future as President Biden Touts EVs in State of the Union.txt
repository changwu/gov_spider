    One day after President Biden highlighted in his State of the Union address how his interrelated economic and climate agendas are creating American manufacturing jobs to build electric vehicles (EVs), Ford announced a historic reorganization to accelerate its production of EVs and succeed in the electric future.
The Biden-Harris Administration has rallied automakers and autoworkers behind making more EVs in America. The President has stood with CEOs to announce new manufacturing facilities across the country that will create good-paying, union jobs up and down the EV supply chain—building electric vehicles, batteries, chargers, and more. Ford's announcement is the latest investment by a major company in domestic manufacturing, with more than $200 billion being invested since 2021 to make semiconductors, electric vehicles, aircrafts, and batteries right here in America. The news follows GM's plan to invest $7 billion in Michigan to expand EV manufacturing, President Biden announcing a new EV charging manufacturing facility in Tennessee, and more.
