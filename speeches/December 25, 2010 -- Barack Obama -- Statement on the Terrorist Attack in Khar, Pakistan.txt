    I strongly condemn the outrageous terrorist attack in Khar, Pakistan. Killing innocent civilians outside a World Food Programme distribution point is an affront to the people of Pakistan and to all humanity. The United States stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time and will strongly support Pakistan's efforts to ensure greater peace, security, and justice for its people.
