With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House & Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!Retweets: 15648Favorites: 67041

The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!Retweets: 19171Favorites: 74152
