 White House Pool Report #1: Kudlow gaggle 
Greetings! Larry Kudlow briefly gaggled in the WH driveway, calling the jobs numbers today "spectacular." He noted a "booming housing sector, booming auto sector.""I think the recovery probably started in late April, May. I think we're in a V-shaped recovery.""I like where we are. What I don't like is the fact that there's still too many people not working.""I think the president's payroll tax deferral will be extremely helpful."
On a COVID relief deal on the Hill, Kudlow said extending the PPP loans "would be very helpful" along with more aid to schools.

 White House pool report #2: signing ceremony change 
The pool was taken to the Roosevelt Room around 11 am where two small desks were set up for a signing ceremony that is slated to include the President of Bosnia and the PM of Kosovo. About 10 mins later we were taken back down to the briefing room without the signing having taken place. We're told the signing will now be in the Oval Office and are still waiting to be taken there.

Pence, Kushner, Sen Ron Johnson, ambassador Grenell and others were standing behind the president as they signed the agreement.
Officials said they hope the economic normalization will lead to a political normalization. "Let's give them a little taste of the Trump economy," Grenell said.
"Speaking of job growth i think it's important to say our unemployment rate dropped all the way to 8.4 percent," Trump said. "8.4 percent is an incredible number way ahead of schedule."
"It took decades because you didn't have anybody trying to get it done," Trump said of the agreement. "There was a lot of fighting and now there's a lot of love." He credited Grenell for bringing the nations together. "Economics can bring people together."
President Vucic asked to speak. He said Trump had done a "great job" and praised his commitment to the region. Invited him to visit Serbia, said he'd be the first US president since jimmy carter.
PM Hoti praised this as a huge step forward.
Pence congratulated both leaders and praised Trump's "commitment to peace."
Trump also thanked Johnson, saying there are many people from Serbia and Kosovo in Wisconsin. Johnson said people from those countries are "fantastic hosts." "This is a big day for stability in the Balkans."
"You have a very good tennis player playing right now," trump said to president Vucic.
Trump asked by reporter if rate of job growth is fast enough: "You're going to see tremendous growth in the very near future." Said he spoke to Pfizer today and has hopes for vaccines soon. "To me even better when it comes to therapeutics you'll have some incredible news very soon." Said it was a "miracle" how quickly cases went down in Arizona. "Those areas that popped up are really going down." Said convalescent plasma and remdesivir keeping mortality rate down. He said Execs have told him "If this was a more typical kind of President getting these approvals would take two or five years." "As a country we have really done a terrific job," on coronavirus.
He also talked more about the Atlantic story:
"It's a fake story and it's a disgrace that they're allowed to do it" Points out that John Bolton didn't confirm this account in his book.
"To me they're heroes." He said of those who serve, especially those who give their lives. "it's even hard to believe how they could do it"
