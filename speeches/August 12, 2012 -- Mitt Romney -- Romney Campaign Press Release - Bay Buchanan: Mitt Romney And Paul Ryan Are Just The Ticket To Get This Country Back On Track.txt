    Senior Advisor to the Romney Campaign Bay Buchanan today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Paul Ryan is a conservative hero, and I am excited about Mitt Romney's choice of Ryan as his Vice Presidential running mate. I can't imagine a better team to stop the out-of-control spending in Washington, repeal Obamacare, and get this country back on the right track. To a country languishing under four years of Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are just the ticket."
