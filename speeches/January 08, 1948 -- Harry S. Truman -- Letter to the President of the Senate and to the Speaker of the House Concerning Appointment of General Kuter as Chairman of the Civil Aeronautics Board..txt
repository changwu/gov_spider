    My dear :
I am attaching hereto a draft of bill to authorize the President to appoint Major General Laurence S. Kuter as a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board, without affecting his military status and perquisites. I contemplate designating Major General Kuter as Chairman of the Board.
The draft of bill would provide that Major General Kuter would continue, while serving as a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board, to receive his military pay and allowances, with Department of the Air Force appropriations being reimbursed therefor from appropriations of the Civil Aeronautics Board, but that, in the performance of his duties as a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board, Major General Kuter would be subject to no supervision or control by the Department of the Air Force, the National Military Establishment, or the armed services of the United States. The bill provides that in the event the civilian salary of a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board should at any time exceed Major General Kuter's military pay and allowances, the difference would be paid to him from Civil Aeronautics Board appropriations.
I would appreciate your aid in having the bill introduced in the Senate. Since it is desirable to send Major General Kuter's nomination to the Senate at an early date, I would appreciate your aid in securing the passage of the bill as soon as practicable.
Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
