    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Montgomery (D) MS and 2 others)
On October 9, 1990, the Administration transmitted to Congress a draft legislative proposal "To amend the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940." That proposal would address the concerns of Reserve Forces activated for Operation Desert Shield. It.would provide Reservists on active duty with protection in court proceedings and protection from adverse action by creditors. It would also protect their dependents from eviction. In addition, the Administration has transmitted to Congress draft legislation to provide professional liability protection for certain military personnel.
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5814. That bill has the same goals as the Administration's proposals, but differs in certain respects. The Administration will work with the Senate to conform H.R. 5814 more closely with the Administration's proposals.
