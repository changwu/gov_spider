What a Speech!...The Donald says it's time to "Make America Great Again"
His big presidential announcement was today at 11 AM ET.
"I will build a great wall. And nobody does walls better than me. Very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall."
