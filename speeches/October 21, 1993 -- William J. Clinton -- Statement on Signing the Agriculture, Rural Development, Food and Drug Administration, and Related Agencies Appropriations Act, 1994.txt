    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2493, the "Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994."
The bill makes a significant shift in priorities by funding $745 million of my investment proposals, including full funding of the investment proposals for the Food Safety and Inspection initiative and for the Food and Drug Administration.
The Congress has also adopted my goal to phase in full funding for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). This bill provides $3.2 billion for WIC, an increase of 12 percent over FY 1993.
The bill includes significant funding for my Rural Development initiative, which will provide grants, direct loans, and loan guarantees for rural residents, communities, and businesses, as well as for inducements to promote economic development.
I commend the Congress for making further progress toward reform of price-support programs for honey, wool, and mohair as recommended by the National Performance Review. The bill suspends honey subsidy payments for the 1994 crop of honey; however, payments on the 1993 honey crop will be made in FY 1994.
I am pleased that the removal of employment floors will facilitate my objective of reducing Federal employment.
