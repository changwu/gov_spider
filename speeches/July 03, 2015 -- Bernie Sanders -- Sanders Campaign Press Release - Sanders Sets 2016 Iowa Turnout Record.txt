    COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa â€” The biggest Iowa crowd so far for any presidential candidate turned out on a Friday night in Council Bluffs to hear Bernie Sanders ask them to join a new American political revolution to reclaim the government of the United States from the billionaire class.
At least 2,600 people filled the 2,300 chairs at the Mid-America Convention Center and stood at the rear of the cavernous convention hall.
It was a remarkable turnout on the eve of Saturday's Fourth of July celebration as the Bernie called on them to join a mass movement to restore the once-great American middle class.
They cheered when he called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. They applauded when he said it's time to break up the big banks on Wall Street. They shouted approval when he credited Pope Francis for his call for bold action to prevent catastrophic climate change. They rose to their feet when he said the United States should join every other major country and provide health care as a right of citizenship.
