I own one home. It's the only debt I have in the world is the mortgage on my home. And, actually, I think it would be good for this country to have a president that knows what it feels like to have your house lose its value because of irresponsible and reckless behavior by Fannie and Freddie, by the Federal Reserve. I think it would be good for this country to have a president that knows what it's like to owe money and student loans like I once did. Someone who grew up paycheck-to-paycheck. That's why I look forward to that debate with Hillary Clinton. How's she going to say that I don't understand the plight of people that are struggling in America when I myself — through my parents and our upbringing — lived it? So I am proud of where I come from. My parents weren't rich people, but I am proud of what they left us with — which is the chance of a better life and we've been able to achieve that. So I look forward to that debate, especially with the Democrats."

"I think it's good for our country to have a president that knows what it's like, for example, because of Fannie and Freddie because of the Federal Reserve and this irresponsible behavior, what it's like, despite the fact you did nothing wrong, to see your home lose its value. Millions of Americans have gone through that. The same with student loans. We have young Americans out there who owe thousands of dollars in student loans, often for degrees that don't lead to jobs. And I think that experience, having lived through that, is what makes me so passionate about fighting on behalf of Americans who today are struggling. Millions of working Americans who open up the newspaper and read how Wall Street is having record years, how these cronies that are close to the Clintons are doing so well economically, but they continue to struggle despite the fact they work harder than ever."

"We now have a choice to make about who is going to be the leader of this country in the 21st century. And I am confident that if we can continue to communicate who we are, what we'll do if given this chance, we are going to continue to improve. These polls will go up and down. And, as I said, historically we know that these polls the week before the election can change dramatically. So, we are going to continue to do what we are doing. That's all I can control is my campaign and what we talk about. We're going to continue to talk about our vision for America's future and our plan to get us there. And I have confidence the voters are going to choose us in the end."
