    Former Governor Vilsack Unveils Ad to Begin Airing Tomorrow
DES MOINES, IA- Former Governor Tom Vilsack today released the first television advertisement for Senator Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The ad, titled "Invisible," is scheduled to begin airing tomorrow in television markets across Iowa.
"Too many Americans - middle class families - families without health care and child care - returning veterans - have been invisible to this President and this government," Vilsack said as he unveiled the new Clinton ad at a news conference in Des Moines.
"That will change when Hillary Clinton becomes President," Vilsack continued. "She has a lifelong record helping Americans who have been ignored, and she has the experience and the strength to bring the change we need in Iowa and all across the nation."

"Invisible"
HRC: As I travel around America, I hear from so many people who feel like they're just invisible to their government
VO: Hillary Clinton has spent her life standing up for people others don't see
HRC: You know, if you're a family that is struggling, and you don't have health care well you are invisible to this President
HRC: If you're a single mom trying to find affordable child care so you can go to work, well you're invisible too
HRC: And I never thought I would see that our soldiers who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan would be treated as though they were invisible as well
HRC: Americans from all walks of life across our country may be invisible to this President, but they're not invisible to me and they won't be invisible to the next President of the United States
HRC: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
