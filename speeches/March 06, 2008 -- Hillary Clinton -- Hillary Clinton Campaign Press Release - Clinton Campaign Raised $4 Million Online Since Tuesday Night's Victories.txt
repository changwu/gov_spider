"The excitement from Senator Clinton's victories Tuesday night has resulted in an historic outpouring of grassroots support," said Internet Director Peter Daou. "Hillary's supporters have come through every time we've needed them, and they are setting a record pace now as we move ahead to the upcoming contests."
In addition to raising $4 million online since the polls closed on Tuesday, the campaign has received support from over 40,000 donors through noon today, of whom 30,000 are new.
