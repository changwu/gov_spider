AUDIO
RUDY GIULIANI: "There's no question. Taxes go down. Revenues go up."
VOICEOVER: "He cut taxes 23 times by 9 billion. Reduced welfare 640,000. Eliminated 20,000 bureaucrats. And cut real per capita spending. All in a place where people said it was impossible. Now, Rudy Giuliani has a new plan. He'll cut taxes. Lower income taxes. Reduce business taxes. And do away with the marriage penalty and the death tax for good."
RUDY GIULIANI: "We need accountability in the spending of our money so that people have confidence in government again."
VOICEOVER: "Rudy will also rein in runaway federal spending. Do away with earmarks. Make agency heads find 5 to 10 percent savings in every budget. And when nearly half of the federal work force retires over the next 8 years, he'll only replace half of them. Rudy Giuliani. He won't just talk about cutting taxes and reducing government. He'll deliver."
RUDY GIULIANI: "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approved this message."
VOICEOVER: "Paid for by the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee, Incorporated. JoinRudy2008.com"
