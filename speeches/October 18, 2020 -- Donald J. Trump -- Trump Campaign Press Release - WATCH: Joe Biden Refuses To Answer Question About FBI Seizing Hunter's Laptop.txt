During a campaign stop today, Joe Biden refused to answer a question about the FBI seizing his son Hunter's laptop last year. The laptop contained emails about the Biden family receiving payouts from China and other foreign sources. Emails also revealed that Hunter arranged meetings between a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and then-Vice President Biden
 
The Biden campaign has not disputed the authenticity of these emails or that Hunter dropped off his laptop at a repair shop last year and forget to retrieve it, yet Joe Biden still refuses to answer basic questions. Joe Biden has been lying to the American people. He must answer these questions:

Has your son Hunter every introduced you to one of his business partners?
Why would a grand jury subpoena Hunter's laptop?
Did you meet with Vadym Pozharskyi, the Burisma executive who thanked Hunter in an email for the opportunity to meet you?
Is Hunter holding money for you?
Did you make Hunter give you half of his income?
Can you explain the 10% stake in a Chinese energy company that was described as being held for you?
Are you compromised by the Chinese?
Your son Hunter Biden had a joint bank account with a Chinese national that financed $100,000 in credit card purchases around the world for him as well as your brother James. This happened while you were Vice President. Why would people connected to the Chinese governments want to give your son and brother so much money?
