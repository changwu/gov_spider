    Today, President Biden announced a milestone for the special enrollment period the Administration opened because of the pandemic: more than one million Americans have signed up for health insurance in less than three months.
President Biden reasserted his belief that health care is a right – not a privilege – and that ensuring every single American has access to quality, affordable care is a national imperative. He also noted that because of the American Rescue Plan, 4 out of 5 people can now buy a plan for less than $10 a month, and that the American Families Plan could make those premium reductions permanent – lowering millions of American families' monthly health care costs.
Joining President Biden, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra reminded Americans to sign up for health coverage at HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov by August 15 to find a plan that works for them.
