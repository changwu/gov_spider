    As we ring in a New Year, Brad Parscale, Campaign Manager for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., released the following statement:
"As we close out a record year of peace and prosperity and look ahead with great optimism and determination to excel in 2020, we at the Trump Campaign wish all Americans a very Happy New Year. Under President Trump's leadership, more Americans are working than ever before, unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the jobs numbers for women, blacks, Latinos, Asians, and veterans are all at historic levels. The news is good for everyone, as wages are rising across the board - and at even faster rates for those at the lower end of the spectrum. The best news is that this is just the beginning and we welcome all Americans to join us in 2020 to Keep America Great by reelecting Donald Trump. Happy New Year!"
