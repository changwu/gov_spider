    "When President Obama last took the stage at the Democratic Convention, he promised Americans a better future with more jobs, lower bills, and larger incomes. But after four years, it's clear the President just hasn't lived up to his promises. Jobs have declined, incomes have plummeted, and household costs are skyrocketing. Mitt Romney will get our country back on track by creating 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Four Years Ago, Candidate Obama Criticized An Economy "In Turmoil" With More Americans Out Of Work And Bills That Are "Beyond Reach":
Candidate Obama, At The 2008 Democratic Convention: "Our Economy Is In Turmoil ... More Americans Are Out Of Work And More Are Working Harder For Less...." OBAMA: "We meet at one of those defining moments – a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.
Candidate Obama: "More Of You Have Lost Your Homes ... Credit Card Bills You Can't Afford To Pay, Tuition That's Beyond Reach. ... We Are A Better Country Than This." OBAMA: "More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. ... America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks, Denver, CO, 8/28/08)
