Last year, Hillary Clinton met with mothers who have lost their children to gun violence, police, and racially charged incidents.

After that meeting, Maria Hamilton, mother of Dontre Hamilton; and Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner,?talked about how it felt to be in that room.
"We're hoping that we can partner with Hillary to get some true change for all people," Maria said. "It's needed."
Over the next few months, the mothers from that meeting continued to work with one another—and continued to work with Hillary.
And in February, Gwen and Maria joined with three other mothers from that meeting—Geneva Reed-Veal, mother of Sandra Bland; Lucy McBath, mother of Jordan Davis; and Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin—to tell voters why they believe Hillary will create real change.
