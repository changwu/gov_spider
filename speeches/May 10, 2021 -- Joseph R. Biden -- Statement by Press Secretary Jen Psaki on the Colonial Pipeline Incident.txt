    The President continues to be regularly briefed on the Colonial Pipeline incident.
The Administration is continually assessing the impact of this ongoing incident on fuel supply for the East Coast. We are monitoring supply shortages in parts of the Southeast and are evaluating every action the Administration can take to mitigate the impact as much as possible.
The President has directed agencies across the Federal Government to bring their resources to bear to help alleviate shortages where they may occur.
