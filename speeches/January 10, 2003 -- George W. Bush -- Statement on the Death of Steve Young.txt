    Laura and I are saddened by the news of the passing of Steve Young, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. Steve made important contributions to our country as a police officer, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, and as a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. Steve was a true hero for his dedication to ensuring the safety of our communities. He was a great friend and an honorable and loyal man.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
