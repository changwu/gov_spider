    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(McCain (R) Arizona)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 292. The bill should be amended to provide for a boundary study that would assess the existing condition, viable preservation alternatives, and estimated costs of additions to the Saguaro National Monument. Such a study is necessary to make informed recommendations on appropriate boundary adjustments.
