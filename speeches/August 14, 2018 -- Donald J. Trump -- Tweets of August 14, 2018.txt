Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State. He has my complete & total Endorsement! He brought the amazing Foxconn to Wisconsin with its 15000 Jobs-and so much more. Vote for Scott on Tuesday in the Republican Primary!Retweets: 18492Favorites: 76016

.@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa. I don't have that word in my vocabulary and never have. She made it up. Look at her MANY recent quotes saying....Retweets: 16393Favorites: 66658

....such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true Champion of Civil Rights - until she got fired. Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn't want interviews) when she worked in the White House. Now that she says bad about me they will talk to her. Fake News!Retweets: 16968Favorites: 74771

Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch: 'The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else. There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok & his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI. We know this...Retweets: 18871Favorites: 75498

....guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus. Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation. Instead Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong. He used Strzok he used the Clinton DNC Dossier...the whole thing....Retweets: 14104Favorites: 57675

....should be shut down. The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.' Thank you Judicial Watch I couldn't have said it better myself!Retweets: 15683Favorites: 66489

When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!Retweets: 21625Favorites: 92317

Bruce Ohr of the 'Justice' Department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele 'find dirt on Trump.' Ohr's wife Nelly was in on the act big time - worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier. @foxandfriendsRetweets: 17242Favorites: 66054

'They were all in on it clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn't do.' Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people.Retweets: 19742Favorites: 73779

Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC!Retweets: 24154Favorites: 97054

Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn't this so-called 'probe' ended immediately? Why aren't these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?Retweets: 22093Favorites: 91079
