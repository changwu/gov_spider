Travel pool #7 - WH Background on wild fires
The WH shares this background

The White House has been closely monitoring the fires in New Mexico and has been in regular contact with state officials throughout the past month. The President has been briefed regularly and he is committed to ensuring the people of New Mexico have the full support of the Federal Government, and that every effort is being made to provide immediate help to people in the impacted communities and to support the state throughout its recovery.


The National Interagency Fire Center continues to surge resources to the state. There are now over 4,000 wildfire personnel on the ground fighting these fires and working to protect New Mexicans and their property. The Hermits Peak fire, which is currently the largest in the state, is now 66% contained and the firefighting response continues.


Following the President’s approval of a Major Disaster Declaration on May 4, FEMA has deployed additional staff to New Mexico to coordinate federal assistance and address unmet needs.


FEMA now has almost 350 personnel on the ground providing response and recovery support in New Mexico, including helping to register survivors for FEMA and other types of Federal assistance and continuing to complete damage assessments to determine the full scope of recovery needs.


FEMA has awarded a cumulative more than $3 million to more than 900 impacted households for housing repairs and assistance with rentals, as well as funding to meet critical immediate needs.


FEMA has continues to work with the State of New Mexico to operate two Disaster Recovery Centers, which provide a wide array of recovery resources to survivors and continues to send Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams out to communities to reach people where they are.


FEMA has activated Transitional Sheltering Assistance to provide hotel stays for evacuated residents and is working closely with the state to identify long-term housing solutions for displaced residents.


The Small Business Administration has disaster recovery specialists and public information officers in the field, imbedded with FEMA at the Disaster Recovery Centers and Business Recovery Center in Lincoln County, to work with individuals, families, and businesses to apply for low-interest disaster loans that will supplement what other Federal assistance and insurance do not cover. SBA has already awarded nearly $2.6 million in disaster loans.


In addition, the Federal government is providing a variety of support to communities, Farmers, and Ranchers to recover and rehabilitate impacted areas.


USDA-Farm Service Agency (FSA) is offering several disaster assistance programs to assist farmers and ranchers, including support for livestock, restoration of pasture and grazing land lost to fire, and emergency conservation.


The Department of the Interior (DOI) and USFS interagency Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams are working with state officials in New Mexico. These teams identify and implement emergency land treatments to minimize threats to life or property or prevent further damage to natural and cultural resources on Federal land.


The USDA has an Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWPP) that helps to relieve imminent threats to life and property caused by fire that impairs a watershed, including technical and financial assistance to help communities address these threats.


The US Army Corps of Engineers and DOI are working to address the impacts from ongoing drought in New Mexico and across the region through several programs to support investment in groundwater wells, water lines, water tanks, and stormflow infrastructure, as well as flood protection and ecosystem restoration efforts to ensure access to clean drinking water for all residents.

Your pooler also saw a group of people gathered around pickup trucks with a "Fuck Biden" and a "Trump Won" flag.
Your pooler did not see the president exit his car. The pool was brought at 3:04 PM in a room where POTUS will receive a briefing and give remarks.
Officials were waiting for him around tables.
There are flags of New Mexico and of the United States in the background and maps.
POTUS entered the room at 3:12 PM.

I also add a link to my Otter.

He had warm words for firefighters: "You are all crazy. I love you"
The president said he saw the devastation from Air Force One and added that the wildfires in NM have damaged an "astounding amount of territory" .
Said it looked like a "moonscape"
"We have a responsibility as a government"
He then announced that "the federal government is covering 100% of the costs" which drew applause from the audience.

Travel Pool #9b - Governor Grisham at the briefing
Thanks copooler Nikki Schwab for sharing these quotes of Governor Grisham earlier, at the beginning of the briefing at the Emergency Operations Center
"President Biden, I want to personally thank you on behalf of the people of this great state for standing together with us here today."
"This is now the largest fire in our long history and while wildfires have occurred since time immemorial, this one was not caused naturally."
"And your administration has leaned in from the very beginning, not only identifying how the fire was caused, by actions of U.S. Forest Service, but recognizing that we need to do things differently together. We are grateful for that assistance, we are grateful for the investments that you continue to make in the state to make sure that we are as safe as possible."
"But this is why, I think we need the federal government to keep accepting responsibility and I know that you have been reviewing our requests to cover 100 percent of the costs of the fire-related recovery effort."
"We need help the debris removal, watershed protection for our workers ..."
"Mr. President I want to say a couple more things. It's really more than all of that work we need to do together. We don't want to lose sight of the fact that 1,200 homes were burned, hundreds of thousands of acres of farm and grazing land destroyed and many family businesses lost. It's about the blood and sweat of generations of New Mexicans who work the land, who fed their families and raised their children - all of that just went up in smoke."

Travel pool #10 - Visit of the Emergency Operations Center
﻿Pool was brought at 4:02 PM in a small amphitheater where approx 15 people are sitting behind computers.

The president entered at 4:37 PM.
He looked at the map while being briefed by
Mark Chappell, the Emergency Operations Director.
Carmelita Austin, agency worker, detailed the coordination of efforts against the wildfires.
Mark Chappell said that "over 1% of New Mexico is on fire"
POTUS then spoke
Please check these rough quotes against audio and transcript
"Thanks for what you do"
"We have a responsibility … at the federal level"
He said he had the "dubious distinction" of visiting many sites of natural disasters
POTUS stressed that there is also a need to deal with the "aftermath" of fires
"I have no reluctance to do everything we possibly can" to meet NM needs
"This is a federal system"
"Climate change will continue"
"And by the way … Windmills do not cause cancer"
"We have to rethink how we develop" and "how we build"
"When I think climate change… I think jobs"
He stopped talking at 4:52 and pool was then led out.
We are now holding in a hallway.
