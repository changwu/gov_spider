    DES MOINES, Iowa â€“ Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Bernie Sanders, issued the following statement on Monday regarding his Medicare for all health care proposal:
"At a time when we are the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for all and when we spend far more per person that any other country, the time is long overdue for us to pass a Medicare for all, single-payer program. Medicare for all would save the average family thousands of dollars a year in health care costs. Secretary Clinton is inaccurate in suggesting that Republican governors would be able to circumvent the law and deny implementation in their states. The bill Sen. Sanders introduced was very clear. It is national legislation for all states."
