Segment From WTPL's "The NH Wake Up Show"
Peter St. James: "We're mortgaging our future."
Mitt Romney: "Yeah, it's sad. And that's a phrase that I use and a lot of people do. 'Mortgaging our future.' In some respects, it's true. But in other respects we're mortgaging our kids' future. Because most of us like me are going to be long gone when these massive deficits and all the interest associated with them is going to be paid. The folks at USA Today did a calculation. They looked at all the promises that government has made. And the shortfall in the money the government has to meet the promises it came out to $62 trillion and that was $532,000 per household – per household. I mean, it's unthinkable that we're adding this kind of burden to the next generation and we just have to say stop to this madness which really threatens the future of America and the prosperity of our children."
