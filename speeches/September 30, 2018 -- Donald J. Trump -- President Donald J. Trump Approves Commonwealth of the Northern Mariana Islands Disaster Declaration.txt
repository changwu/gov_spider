    Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump declared that a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and ordered Federal assistance to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Typhoon Mangkhut from September 10 to September 11, 2018.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the islands of Rota, Saipan, and Tinian.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to Commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Typhoon Mangkhut in the islands of Rota, Saipan, and Tinian.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures throughout the entire commonwealth.
Brock Long, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Benigno Bern Ruiz as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA(3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.
