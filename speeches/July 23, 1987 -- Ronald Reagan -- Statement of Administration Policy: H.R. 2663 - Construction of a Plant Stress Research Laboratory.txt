    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Combest (R) Texas and 2 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2663. Construction of this laboratory, which would cost $27 million, is a low priority and cannot be justified in today's budgetary climate. Significant work on plant stress and crop production is currently being done in Lubbock, Texas, the site of the proposed new laboratory, using existing personnel and facilities.
