    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith propose, in connection with the transmittal of my 1977 budget, actions that would reduce Federal spending by more than half a billion dollars over this fiscal year and the two following. These proposals reflect the priorities in my new budget--a reduced rate of growth in Federal spending and choices that seek fairness and balance within that restrained growth.
I am proposing--in accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974-16 new recisions that total $924 million and reporting six new deferrals of $1,858 million in budget authority. I am also revising--by a net $14 million--the amounts for three rescission proposals now pending before the Congress and increasing by $19 million a deferral previously reported.
The details of the proposed rescissions and deferrals are contained in the attached reports. Further information on each of the rescissions proposed by this message and others pending before the Congress is included in Part III of the appendix to the 1977 budget.
