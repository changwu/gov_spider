    For the first time in months there is reason for some optimism for those of us who are hoping for a 1995 baseball season with real major league players.
The players have agreed to return to work if the district court judge issues an injunction.
If the judge does grant the injunction, I hope the owners decide to let the players play ball.
In October, in an attempt to assist the parties, we appointed Bill Usery as special mediator with the hope that he could bring the owners and players together at the bargaining table, where ultimately this dispute must be resolved. He has done his best to get that job done and will continue to do so.
As the owners and players meet in these last few days before the scheduled start of the season, I hope they will give it their best shot, that they will bargain in good faith and be flexible and willing to compromise so that America's baseball fans again have a sport they can be proud of.
Like millions of other fans across the country, I want to see the Ripkens, Gwynns, Bonds, Mattinglys, and Cones in uniform on the playing field. We're getting down to the wire. Let's hope the owners and players see the light for the sake of the fans and bring back Major League Baseball.
