    Q. Mr. President, the Secretary of Defense was talking about putting missiles here in Canada this morning.
The President. Well, you know, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News] that I'm not taking questions at a photo opportunity like this. But the only thing I know is the Secretary of Defense said it wasn't true. [Laughter]
Q. What wasn't true, sirâ€”that he was going to put missiles in Canada?
Q. Thank you very much.
Q. He ought to know.
Q. Well, is it true or is it not true, sir?
Q. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Principal Deputy Press Secretary Speakes. You're obviously misquoting the Secretary.
Q. Sir, I can't hear you, sir.
Mr. Speakes. You're obviously misquoting the Secretary.
Secretary Weinberger. Sadly, not for the first time.
Q. No, I'm quoting Bill, who was quoting the Secretary.
