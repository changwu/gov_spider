(House)(Young (R) AK)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2505. This bill would allow the Elim Native Corporation to select an additional 29,000 acres of land above their entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. There is no legal or historic justification to support the Corporation's claim to this land. In addition, this type of precedent could open the door for other Native corporations to make similar claims, thereby seriously undermining all of the settlements concluded under the Act.
The Administration is also concerned about the provision dealing with the Calista land exchange. This provision would require an inequitable exchange of lands between the Calista Corporation and the Federal Government.
