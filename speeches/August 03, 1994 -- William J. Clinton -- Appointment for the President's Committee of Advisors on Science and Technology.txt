    The President today announced the membership of a private-sector committee to advise him on major science and technology issues and to help guide Federal investments in science and technology toward national goals. The 18-member President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) is composed of top-level representatives from industry, education and research institutions, and nongovernmental organizations.
"I am very pleased to name these eminent scientists, engineers, business leaders, and educators as some of my key advisers," the President said. "Drawn from a cross-section of America, they will help ensure that our science and technology policies reflect our Nation's needs: health, prosperity based on long-term economic growth and technological investment, national security, environmental responsibility, and improved quality of life."
The appointment of private-sector advisers to the President highlights the administration's goal of fostering public/private partnerships to achieve national science and education goals. "To achieve our goals, we must strengthen partnerships with industry, with State and local governments, and with schools, colleges, and universities across the country," said the President.
"My goal for this committee is to help encourage those partnerships."
