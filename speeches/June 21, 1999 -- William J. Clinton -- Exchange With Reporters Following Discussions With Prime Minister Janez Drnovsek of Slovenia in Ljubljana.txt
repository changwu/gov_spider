    Q. Mr. Prime Minister, I wonder if you could tell us what President Clinton's visit means to your country, what you hope to get out of the visit?
Prime Minister Drnovsek. [Inaudible]â€”to visit, the first time we have the President of the United States in Slovenia, and I think it is confirmation of excellent relations that we established during the last year. And we cooperated in southeast situation; the Kosovo crisis was another crisis.
So I think this is a confirmation for Slovenia, for our partnership, because of our role in this part of the world.
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
Q. Mr. President, yesterday you had a chance to sit down across the table from Boris Yeltsin. We saw him get off at the airport. He looked very frail; at times his speech sounded slurred. You sat across the table, eyeball-to-eyeball. How would you assess Boris Yeltsin today?
President Clinton. Yesterday, I can say, his movements were halting, but his mind was quite clear. He was very precise, very strong, and very eager for us to resolve our past differences and go on into the future. I actually was reassured by the meeting. I thought he was quite strong and quite clear yesterday.
