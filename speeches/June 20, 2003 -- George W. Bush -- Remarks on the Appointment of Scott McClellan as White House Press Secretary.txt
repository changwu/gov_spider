    The President. I am, one, sad that Ari's leaving. He's done a fabulous job for my administration. I appreciate his friendship, his ability to handle a very tough job, and that is dealing with you.
Fortunately, I've got a good man to take his place in Scott McClellan. I've known Scott for a long time. I look forward to working closely with him to make sure that the American people and, of course, the press corps gets the information that's needed to reflect the philosophy and the decisionmaking of this administration. He's able to do the job like Ari did, with the highest amount of professionalism and class, and I've got the full confidence in my new Press Secretary.
Deputy Press Secretary McClellan. Mr. President, I'm honored. Thank you for your support and confidence.
Four-and-a-half years ago, I went to work for the President because I believed in his leadership and I believed in his agenda. I knew that the President was a results-oriented, inclusive leader who governed from clear principles and compassionate conservative philosophy. And we have made a tremendous amount of progress in the last 2 1/2 years, and I look forward to doing my small part as part of an outstanding White House team, to help him build upon that record of accomplishment.
It is also a special privilege to be following my good friend Ari Fleischer, who has served the President exceptionally well and served the American people exceptionally well. I look forward to working with the White House press corps, at least most of you, anyway, as we do our part to keep the American people informed about the decisions that are being made here in Washington, DC.
So Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to it.
The President. Thank you very much.
Ari, thank you, buddy. You've done a great job.
Thank you all. Have a great weekend. See you in Georgia.
