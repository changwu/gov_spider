The President. It's interesting. I mean, I don't know if it's interesting watching it on TV, but it's interesting being part of it.

The President. I think we're establishing that there are actually some areas of real agreement, and we're starting to focus on what the real disagreements are.

And that's a legitimate philosophical disagreement. We'll, hopefully, be able to explore it a little more in the afternoon.
