Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced today that his campaign for president has been endorsed by 15 Pennsylvania State Senators, including former Lieutenant Governor and current State Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati.

They understand that our nation is at a crossroads and that it is time for proven leadership, not showmanship in the White House. I have worked with these fine people and they know my record of consistent conservative results.
