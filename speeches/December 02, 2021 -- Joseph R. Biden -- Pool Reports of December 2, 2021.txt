POTUS Pool Report #5: remarks & Fauci 
At 1:36 PM, the president began his remarks. Just before he entered the room, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins, Jeff Zients and other officials entered the auditorium.
Fauci told pool that the briefing was "good."
Did you talk about travel restrictions? "No. We spoke more about science," Fauci replied.
Moments later, President Biden took the stage. He is speaking now.

POTUS Pool Report #6: government shutdown question
President Joe Biden concluded his remarks at 2:03 PM. As he was near the exit, he took a shouted question on the potential for a government shutdown.
First he said, "no," and called it a "silly question" then he said the following:
"I don't believe that will happen" he said. He offered that he spoke with Sens. McConnell and Schumer, and that a plan is in place, unless someone decides "to be totally erratic."
Will send full quote ASAP. As soon as the president left the room, pool was led out and into vans, where it is currently holding and struggling to get a cell signal (apologies for the delay).
Additional color: Health officials are socially distanced seats, with two to three empty seats in between each of them, and at least one empty row in most cases immediately behind them.
A note on the beginning of the president's speech: pool had no warning that Biden was about to take the stage. He began speaking several minutes ahead of schedule. The only indication that the briefing had concluded was that health officials entered the room and took their seats.

POTUS Pool Report #7: government shutdown quote
Motorcade is rolling at 2:23 PM away from NIH and back to the Walter Reed landing zone.
Pool has listened to its audio of the exchange with President Biden repeatedly and here's what what we heard:
Q: Will there be a government shutdown on Friday?
A: "No."
Q: How will you prevent it?
A: "How could you ask such a silly question?"
"Look, I don't believe that will happen We have everything in place to be able to make sure there is not a shutdown, unless some individual...I spoke with Mitch McConnell, I spoke with Schumer, there is a plan in place unless somebody decides to be totally erratic, and I don't think that will happen. So I don't think there will be a shutdown. Thank you."

POTUS Pool Report #8: departing in M1
President Biden held at NIH for several minutes before boarding Marine One at 2:29pm. He was standing behind an SUV for much of htat time, so the pool's view was mostly blocked.
Marine One lifted at 2:33 pm with the president aboard.
Pool is departing separately from NIH in vans for the White House, where a supplemental pool will capture President Biden's arrival. In-town pool next expects to see the president at the National Christmas Tree Lighting.

POTUS Pool Report #9: awaiting POTUS at tree lighting
The press pool is seated in chairs on a riser behind the VIP section at the tree lighting.
At 5:37 pm the vice president, wearing a red top and what appeared to be a black jacket, and her husband, in a black tie and black jacket, entered the event and took their seats in the front.
Kristin Chenoweth began a performance of "The Man With The Bag" moments after they arrived. While she was performing, at 5:40 pm, the president's motorcade could be seen in the distance leaving the White House.
Before her performance, pre-taped Christmas music was playing, including the Mariah Carey classic, "All I Want for Christmas Is You."
A note about this event: a park ranger informed the press pool that a mask mandate is in effect for this outdoor event.

POTUS Pool Report #10: tree lighting
At 5:44 PM the rapper and host of the event, LL Cool J, announced the arrival of the president and first lady.
Pool had a hard time seeing from a distance, but they did not immediately appear -- and the entertainer had to announce the president and first lady a second time at this made for television event that is not airing live.
Jill Biden could be seen from afar in a red coat jacket and black scarf. The president wore a suit and overcoat.
"For our safety, I am going to stand over here and social distance. I don't want to cough on you," LL Cool J told the first couple.
He stood several feet away from them on the other side of a podium that appeared to be behind bullet-proof glass.
Biden then asked attendees to count down from 5 to the lighting of the tree.
The National Christmas Tree turned on with gold and red lights and bulbs with a silver star on top at the end of the countdown.
"I like that job," POTUS said.
LL Cool J replied, "It's a great job."
As they exited the stage an instrumental version of Joy to the World played.
The first couple could be seen greeting VP Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff before taking their seats.
Billy Porter gave a performance next. Event is ongoing.
Some color: red bows and Christmas lights served as trim around the stage. Stacks of red and white boxes wrapped as gifts are also on stage. The stage is covered in red carpet. Behind and to the sides of the stage are rows of lit Christmas trees.

POTUS Pool Report #12: performances ongoing
Several musical guests have performed since the last pool report, including Chris Stapelton & H.E.R. They sang a duet rendition of "This Christmas." Patti LaBelle also performed "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"with the Howard Gospel Choir providing background vocals.
"YES! God bless you!" she said at the end. LaBelle added that the president and VP are taking us to a "great, great place."
Throughout the musical performances, the first and second families sat in the front row but pool could not see them very well from its vantage point.
It is a windy but enjoyable 62 degrees F outside on this atypically warm December evening.
Here are some photos from the tree lighting. I'll add more later when WiFi improves.

Supplemental In-Town Pool Report #4: Arrival 
M1 landed back at the WH at 2:42pm. POTUS disembarked shortly afterwards at 2:45pm, wearing a mask. Pool had been gathered over on the Oval Office side and scrambled upon realizing the President was heading into the WH residence.
Biden did not appear to acknowledge the pool at first and stopped for a few minutes to chat with two females and two young girls standing outside the building. He posed for a photograph with them and then continued chatting.
A man in a military uniform came up to the ground for a moment before backing up again (but still remaining engaged in the conversation).
POTUS then responded to one shouted question as he walked away: "how are you feeling?"
"I'm feeling great," Biden responded before entering the residence at 2:49pm.
Will inquire as to who POTUS chatted with.
