    The President strongly supports reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). His SCHIP proposal expands funding by 20 percent and maintains a focus on covering children in poor families.
Unfortunately, Congress's bill goes far beyond SCHIP's mandate by covering some higher income households and adults.
Months ago, the President made clear he would veto an SCHIP bill that: takes the program away from its original intent of covering poor children; moves millions of American children who now have private health insurance into government-run health care; and is an incremental step toward a government-run health care system. The bill also includes excessive spending funded with significant tax increases.
Once the Democrats finish their political posturing, the President looks forward to working with Congress to pass SCHIP reauthorization legislation he can sign.
The President urges Congress to quickly pass a clean, temporary extension of the current SCHIP program so the millions of families who rely on SCHIP do not suffer when this important program expires on September 30.
