    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. President:)
Supervisors and management officials in GS - 13, 14, and 15 positions throughout the Federal Government are covered by the Performance Management and Recognition System as required by chapter 54 of title 5, United States Code, unless otherwise excluded by law or under the President's authority as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5402(b)(1).
Upon proper application from the United States Department of Justice and upon the recommendation of the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management, I have excluded the United States Marshals from coverage under the Performance Management and Recognition System, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5402(b)(1).
Attached is my report describing the reasons for excluding the U.S. Marshals.
Sincerely,
George Bush
