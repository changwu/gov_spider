    The United States applauds the Czech Republic for hosting the Prague 5G Security Conference. It was an extremely productive meeting on the need for secure telecommunications networks as the game-changing next generation wireless telecommunications networks, known as 5G, become the new global system.
Government officials from more than 30 countries across the globe, alongside representatives from the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and industry, participated in discussions regarding the important national security, economic, and commercial considerations that must be part of each country's evaluation of 5G vendors. Attendees also discussed that important considerations in 5G network architecture include the security of supply chains for telecommunications networks and infrastructure and the risks associated with vendors vulnerable to third country influence.
The United States supports the resulting Prague Proposals on 5G security published by the Czech conference chairman as a set of recommendations for nations to consider as they design, construct, and administer their 5G infrastructure. The United States Government plans to use the Prague Proposals as a guide to ensure our shared prosperity and security.
