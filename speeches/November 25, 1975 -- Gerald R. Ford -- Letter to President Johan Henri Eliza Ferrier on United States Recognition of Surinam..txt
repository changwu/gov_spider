    Dear Mr. President:
I am pleased to send to the Government and people of Surinam my congratulations and the best wishes of the American people upon the attainment of your nation's independence. At the same time I extend to you the recognition of the United States Government and express my hope that, with your agreement, diplomatic relations can be established promptly between our two countries at the Ambassadorial level.
We are fortunate in having a tradition of friendly relations between our peoples upon which we can build a cooperative relationship.
The United States shares the aspirations of your Government for the progress and welfare of the people of Surinam. We look forward to engaging in close and friendly relations aimed at prosperity in the Hemisphere and peace in the world.
GERALD R. FORD
