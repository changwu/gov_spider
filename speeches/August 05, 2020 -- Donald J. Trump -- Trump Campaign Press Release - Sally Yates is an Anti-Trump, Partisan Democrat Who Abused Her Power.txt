    Now she's covering up Joe Biden's abuses. 
Former Obama-Biden Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates is testifying to the Senate about the previous administration's politically motivated targeting of the Trump campaign and transition, including that January 5, 2017, Oval Office meeting with President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Susan Rice. Biden has still not come clean about what he said in that meeting about the Logan Act, and conveniently, today Yates claimed she does not remember what Biden said.
Why is Yates covering for Biden? Because she's an anti-Trump, partisan Democrat. Yates endorsed Biden in March 2020 and participated in a fundraiser for his campaign. In November 2019, Biden said Yates could be his pick for vice president.
Yates joined the anti-Trump resistance as acting U.S. attorney general in January 2017, when she refused to defend in court a lawful policy decision by the president â€“ a decision the Supreme Court predictably ruled was wholly legitimate.
As Bill Barr wrote at the time (as a former attorney general), "While an official is always free to resign if she does not agree with, or has doubts about, the legality of a presidential order, Yates had no authority and no conceivable justification for directing the department's lawyers not to advocate the president's position in court. Her action was unprecedented and must go down as a serious abuse of office."
The fact that Biden would even consider for VP someone who abused their power, damaged our democracy, and undermined the rule of law shows just how destructive a Biden presidency would be to America's institutions.
