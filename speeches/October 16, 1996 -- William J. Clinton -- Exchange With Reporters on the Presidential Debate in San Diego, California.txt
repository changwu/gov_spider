    Q. Can you tell us what you're thinking about—[inaudible]—today?
The President. It's been a long time since I've done one of these townhalls, so I'm looking forward to that. I'm interested to see what the people have on their mind, and I'm looking forward to it. I've done my best to prepare. I've still got some reading to do. I'm going to go back and do a little work now.
Q. If Bob Dole goes real negative, how are you going to respond to that today, Mr. President?
The President. Well, we're going to respond to the people who are in the audience. That's the way this was designed, and we'll just see what happens. I'm going to do my best to respond to their questions and to talk about what I'm going to do for the next 4 years.
