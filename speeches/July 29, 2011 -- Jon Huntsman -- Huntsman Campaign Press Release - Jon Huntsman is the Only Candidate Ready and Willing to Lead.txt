    Last night the American people lost, and politics as usual won. The debt ceiling theatrics are yet another shameful example of the failure of leadership in our nation's capital, where elected leaders continue to play a game of chicken with our economy.
Yesterday Governor Huntsman appeared on Fox News with Greta Van Susteren, and showed why he is the leader America needs.

The President has not offered a plan to avoid default and move America toward solvency, and many of the candidates running to replace him appear too timid to take a stand.
A leader is not someone who sits quietly on the sidelines during a debate of monumental consequences for our future. Jon Huntsman is the only candidate ready and willing to lead. He is the only candidate offering responsible solutions to the debt, jobs, taxes and foreign entanglements.
He is the only candidate with a proven track record on job creation, as a businessman and a governor. He is the only candidate true to his convictions, who's willing to take an unpopular stand because he believes it's best for his country.
As the circus of the last few days have shown, Jon is the leader America needs.
