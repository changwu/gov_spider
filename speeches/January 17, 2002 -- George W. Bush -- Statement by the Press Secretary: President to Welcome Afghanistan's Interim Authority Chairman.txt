    President Bush will welcome Afghanistan's Interim Authority Chairman Hamid Karzai to Washington on January 28, 2002. This visit provides an opportunity to develop the U.S. partnership with Afghanistan to eliminate terrorism and build a stable Afghanistan which will not again become a base for terrorist activity. We look forward to an Afghanistan that is prosperous, accountable to its citizens, and at peace with its neighbors and the international community.
