The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their 'pockets.' The people have little food big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!Retweets: 28227Favorites: 105965

Sanctions and 'other' pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news perhaps not - we will see!Retweets: 17379Favorites: 77959

....impartial journalists of a much higher standard lose all of your phony and non-existent 'sources' and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY so that the next time I (and the people) win you won't have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!

Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics. DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems will start 'falling in love' with Republicans and their President! We are about RESULTS.Retweets: 18580Favorites: 87703

Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career. He has been a tremendous supporter and I will never forget the (beyond kind) statements he has made about me as President. He is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the U.S. Senate! https://t.co/0VjzLEeHTlRetweets: 12392Favorites: 63280

It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing but also many other countries and others. As an example we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue...Retweets: 29334Favorites: 118505

...peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem the toughest part of the negotiation off the table but Israel for that would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?Retweets: 20000Favorites: 94008
