    Hon. JOHN SPARKMAN,
Post Office Building,
Huntsville, Ala.:
Please extend my warm greetings to all those meeting with you on Saturday. Our campaign to start America moving forward again has special meaning for the people of the Huntsville area. The great Redstone Arsenal, with the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and George C. Marshall Space Flight Research Center have a vital role to play in the years ahead. They are important to the progress and prosperity of your area; they are equally important to our space program and our national security. The space program was born at Redstone Arsenal, and I know Redstone and Huntsville will make a great contribution to restoring our leadership in space. I assure you that the next Democratic administration will utilize fully the resources and talents assembled there.
For Huntsville, as for all of the Tennessee Valley, a Democratic program of progress will also mean restoration of a national leadership that truly believes in and supports TVA. TVA is a valued asset to your region and to the Nation, and it is an inspiring demonstration throughout the world of America's capacity for pioneering leadership. I am confident that the kind of Democratic leadership that created TVA will continue its progress and will supply the same bold vision in meeting the great challenges we face in the 1960's. Best personal regards.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
