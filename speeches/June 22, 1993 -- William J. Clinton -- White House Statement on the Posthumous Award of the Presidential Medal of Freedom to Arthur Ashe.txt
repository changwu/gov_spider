    The President awarded a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, to tennis great Arthur Ashe at the National Sports Awards ceremony at Constitution Hall Sunday night.
Presenting the medal to Ashe's widow, Jeanne, the President noted that Ashe "battled his way to the top rung of international tennis, and he did it with an inner strength and outward dignity that marked his game every bit as much as that dazzling crosscourt backhand."
