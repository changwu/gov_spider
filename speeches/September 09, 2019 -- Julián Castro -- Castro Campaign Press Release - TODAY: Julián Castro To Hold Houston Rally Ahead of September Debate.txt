HOUSTON, TX (September 9, 2019) – Today, Monday, September 9, ahead of the upcoming CNN Democratic debate, presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro, will hold a "Castro Country" Houston rally in his home state of Texas before the September Democratic debate with special guest, actress and comedian Cristela Alonzo.
"Secretary Castro showed Americans in the first two debates that he has the experience, agenda, and ability to take on Donald Trump," said campaign manager Maya Rupert. "We look forward to him taking that case to the American people in his home state of Texas—a state whose 38 electoral votes he will win next November."
