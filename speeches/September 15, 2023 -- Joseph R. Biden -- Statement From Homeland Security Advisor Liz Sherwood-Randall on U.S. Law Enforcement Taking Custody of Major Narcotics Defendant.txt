    Today, United States and Mexican law enforcement officials successfully transferred custody to the U.S. Department of Justice of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of "El Chapo" who has been indicted for drug trafficking, money laundering, and other violent crimes. The extradition of Lopez is testament to the significance of the ongoing cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on countering narcotics and other vital challenges, and we thank our Mexican counterparts for their partnership in working to safeguard our peoples from violent criminals. We also recognize that U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials and service members have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty ensuring that there is accountability and justice for those who break the law, and we will remain forever grateful for their the brave and tireless efforts. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to use every tool available to aggressively counter the deadly scourge of fentanyl and other narcotics that are killing so many Americans.
