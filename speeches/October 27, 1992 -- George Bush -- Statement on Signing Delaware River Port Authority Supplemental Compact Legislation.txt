    Today I am signing into law S. 2964, a bill granting the consent of the Congress to a supplemental compact or agreement between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey concerning the Delaware River Port Authority.
Although I have signed S. 2964, I will withhold my approval of H.R. 5452 because it is identical to S. 2964.
George Bush
The White House,
October 27, 1992.
