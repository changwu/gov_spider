    Vice President Biden spoke to Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades today to discuss issues of regional concern, including the situation in Ukraine. The two leaders expressed firm support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and consulted on steps to lead to a de-escalation of the situation and peaceful resolution. The Vice President welcomed the conclusions of the European Council on March 6, which sent a strong signal that Russia's military actions in Crimea are unacceptable. Finally, the Vice President also applauded the resumption of U.N.-led talks to achieve a just and lasting Cyprus settlement and re-affirmed the United States' full support for the Cypriot-led process, under the auspices of the United Nations Good Offices Mission.
