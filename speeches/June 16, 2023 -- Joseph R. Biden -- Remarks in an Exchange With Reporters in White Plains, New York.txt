    2024 Presidential Election/National Economy 
Q. Mr. President, what's your message at your rally tomorrow—your political rally?
The President. Every major union—every major labor union in the country is endorsing me tomorrow. And I'm saying that my—my philosophy about building from the middle out and the bottom up is working. The wealthy are doing well. We've created over 13 million jobs. We have over 800,000 working class folks get—manufacturing. Things are working.
Q. Is this the kickoff for your campaign tomorrow?
The President. I kicked it off a while ago.
