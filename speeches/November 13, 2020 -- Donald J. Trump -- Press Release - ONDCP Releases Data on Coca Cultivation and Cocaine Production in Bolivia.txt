"Cocaine production in Bolivia represents a serious threat to the people of the United States and Bolivia. This latest report indicating a rise in coca cultivation and production in Bolivia shows the critical need for the incoming government to take immediate and concrete steps to reverse this damaging trend," ONDCP Director Jim Carroll stated. "The Trump Administration stands ready to work with Bolivia's new leadership to address this issue for the betterment of both of our nations."
