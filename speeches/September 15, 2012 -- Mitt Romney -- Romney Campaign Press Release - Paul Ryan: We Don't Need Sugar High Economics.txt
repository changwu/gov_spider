PAUL RYAN: "Now here we are, just last month we got a really bad jobs report that came to us on Friday—a week ago Friday. For every person who found a job in America, which is great, nearly four people stopped looking for work. We had 23 million people struggling to find work today. And just yesterday, we heard that the Federal Reserve is coming with a new bailout. This matters. So the Federal Reserve is basically saying that we don't have a recovery. Obamanomics didn't work. So now, they're coming with their bailout. Here is the problem: we don't need sugar high economics. We don't need synthetic money creation. We need economic growth. We want wealth creation. We don't want to print money. We want opportunity and growth."
