    I have been briefed by the Attorney General on today's arrests in Nevada, and we will continue to monitor the situation. I cannot comment on the details of this ongoing law enforcement effort, but let me say this:
All Americans should be deeply grateful to the brave law enforcement officers, especially the agents of the FBI, for their excellent work in this case. It is important for the American people to understand that their law enforcement officials have this situation under control. All materials have been seized and are being analyzed to determine if they are in any way threatening.
