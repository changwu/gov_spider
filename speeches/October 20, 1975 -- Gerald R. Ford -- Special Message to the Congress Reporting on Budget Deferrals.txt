    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report eight new deferrals totalling $16.1 million in budget authority. In addition, I am transmitting two supplementary deferrals that increase amounts previously reported by $18.6 million.
The eight new deferrals are for programs of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. These deferrals establish, for the programs reported, funding levels that differ from the general levels allowed by the continuing resolution. The Congress is now in the process of substituting the several uniform funding levels set by the continuing resolution with funding levels for each program. The new deferrals I am reporting preserve the possibility of conducting the reported programs in 1976 at the levels I have recommended and, in one case, at the level the Senate has recommended.
The details of all ten deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
