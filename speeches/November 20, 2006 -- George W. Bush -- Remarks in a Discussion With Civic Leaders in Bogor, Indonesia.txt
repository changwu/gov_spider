    Mr. President, thank you very much. Thank you all for joining. I'm really looking forward to this discussion. I admire Indonesia's pluralism and its diversity. I admire your President's commitment to reform and strengthening democracy. It's very important for the people of America to understand that this vast country has got not only tremendous potential, but it's got a prominent role to play in the worldâ€”showing how it's possible for people of good will to live together in peace and harmony. And that's the lesson I want to hear from you all as well. I'm looking forward to our discussion.
I cannot thank you enough for taking time out of your busy day to come up here and share thoughts with us. I'm very interested in learning how our Government can continue to work with your Government, as it so chooses, to help, particularly in areas like education and health.
And so with that, Mr. President, thank you very much for setting this up. I appreciate the opportunity to meet some of your fine citizens. Thank you.
