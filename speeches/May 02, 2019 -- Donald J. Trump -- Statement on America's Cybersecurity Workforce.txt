    Today I signed an Executive order to strengthen America's cybersecurity workforce. Protecting America's national security and promoting the prosperity of the American people are top priorities for my administration. More than 300,000 cybersecurity job vacancies exist in the United States today. They must be filled to protect our critical infrastructure, national defense, and the American way of life. These jobs represent an incredible economic opportunity for America's workers, and my administration is working to ensure they have the skills they need to seize it.
This Executive order will promote both our national and economic security. It requires the Federal Government to do more to provide access to cybersecurity skills training, to identify the most skilled cybersecurity workers, and to advance career opportunities in the public and private sectors. It also requires the Federal Government to strengthen America's cybersecurity workforce by making the best use of individuals' cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and abilities and by enhancing their education and training opportunities. These actions will enable more Americans to secure well-paying jobs that grow our Nation's wealth and increase our security.
