    Five years ago, a financial catastrophe on Wall Street was rapidly fueling a punishing recession on Main Street that ultimately cost millions of jobs and hurt families across the country. So as we prepared steps to rescue our economy and put Americans back to work, we also put in place tough rules of the road to make sure a crisis like that never happened again: rules that reward sound financial practices, allow honest innovation, and strengthen the financial system's ability to support job creation and durable economic growth.
As part of this Wall Street reform, we fought to include the Volcker rule, a rule that makes sure big banks can't make risky bets with their customers' deposits. The Volcker rule will make it illegal for firms to use Government-insured money to make speculative bets that threaten the entire financial system and demand a new era of accountability from CEOs who must sign off on their firm's practices.
Our financial system will be safer and the American people are more secure because we fought to include this protection in the law. I thank Paul Volcker, a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve and adviser I trust, for helping to create this important safeguard. I also thank Secretary Lew and the regulators who worked diligently to finalize the rule by the end of this year as we called on them to do. I encourage Congress to give these regulators adequate funding to effectively and efficiently implement the rule, which will help protect hard-working families and business owners from future crisis and restore everyone's certainty and confidence in America's dynamic financial system.
