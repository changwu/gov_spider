    On behalf of the Armenian Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers, Soviet Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin presented medallions and certificates of appreciation to Jeb Bush and his son, George P. Bush, in gratitude for "the sincere sympathy you extended to the Armenian people during their recent misfortunes and the generous help you offered during the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that took thousands of human lives and ruined many cities and towns." The certificates note that the Armenian people "will never forget this demonstration of human charity." The presentation was made to the President by Ambassador Dubinin during a brief visit to the White House on May 14.
The earthquake struck Armenia on December 7, 1988. Jeb and his son were among the volunteers who accompanied the fourth airlift by Americares, the international medical relief agency based in Connecticut, to Armenia on December 24, 1988. The airlift carried approximately 100,000 pounds of medicines, clothing, and toys for the children of Armenia. The Bushes visited the devastated region around the Armenian capital of Yerevan and conveyed a message of sympathy from the American people to the Armenian people and especially to the children during that holiday season. The U.S. Government also provided disaster relief through the Agency for International Development's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance.
