    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days of the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001, as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013, relating to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is to continue in effect for 1 year beyond August 17, 2017.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
