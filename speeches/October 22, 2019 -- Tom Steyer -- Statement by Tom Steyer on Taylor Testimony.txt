    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 22, 2019) â€” Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the statement below after the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told members of Congress that President Donald Trump directed officials to tie foreign aid to Ukraine to demands that the country publicly open an investigation into the Biden family and the 2016 election.
"Mr. Taylor's testimony today provides further proof that Mr. Trump knowingly held up security aid from Ukraine to get dirt on a political opponent. This fits with his pattern of criminal behavior and is exactly why I launched Need to Impeach, a movement of over 8.3 million Americans, exactly two years ago. Americans deserve to see these crimes laid bare before their eyes, and I urge to Speaker Pelosi and House Leadership once again to make all these hearings public.
"This process started with the American people raising their voices and demanding Trump be held accountable, and it will end with the removal of the most lawless president in our nation's history if Congress makes all of the evidence publicly available to them."
