    I applaud today's vote in the Senate to allow for environmentally responsible energy exploration in a small part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. A reliable domestic supply of energy is important to America's security and prosperity. This project will keep our economy growing by creating jobs and ensuring that businesses can expand. And it will make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy, eventually by up to a million barrels of oil a day.
I also call on the Congress to pass a comprehensive national energy plan that will diversify supply, increase conservation and efficiency, and upgrade our energy infrastructure.
