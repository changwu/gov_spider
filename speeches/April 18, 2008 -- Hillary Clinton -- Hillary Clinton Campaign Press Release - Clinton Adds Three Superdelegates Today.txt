    Former NJ Governors Jim Florio & Brendan Byrne, follow US Rep Betty Sutton (D-OH) in pledging their support to Hillary
Former New Jersey Governors Jim Florio and Brendan Byrne pledged their support to Hillary Clinton today, after being chosen Thursday as add-on superdelegates. Their show of support comes the same day US Rep. Betty Sutton announced she too would support Clinton as a superdelegate.
"I am grateful for the support of both former New Jersey governors Byrne and Florio, as well as Rep. Sutton," Clinton said. "Together, with their support and millions of others, we will deliver health care to every American, jumpstart the economy, and turn our great country around. Our campaign is experiencing great momentum."
Brendan Byrne served as the 47th Governor of New Jersey from 1974 to 1982 and co-writes a weekly column with his successor Thomas Kean on state and national public affairs. James Florio was the first Italian American governor of New Jersey, serving from 1990 to 1994.
Rep. Sutton served eight years in the Ohio State House prior to being elected to represent Ohio's 13th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006. Before being elected to Congress, she worked as a labor attorney fighting for the rights of Ohio's workers.
