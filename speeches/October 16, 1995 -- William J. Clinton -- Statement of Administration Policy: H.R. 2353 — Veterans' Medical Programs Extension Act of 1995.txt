    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Hutchinson (R) AR and 11 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2353, but: will seek amendments in the Senate to delete two unnecessary provisions in the bill.
Section 2 of the bill would require a review of the scientific evidence pertaining to the health consequences of Persian Gulf service. This requirement is duplicative of current law provisions that already require such a review. Moreover, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continuously monitors the scientific literature on this subject and can report to Congress on the subject at any time a request is made.
The Administration also urges the deletion of section 4. This section would require VA to display daily the National League of Families POW/MIA flag at VA medical centers nationwide pending a full accounting of Vietnam-era prisoners of war and service-members missing-in-action. VA medical centers fly the POW/MIA flag on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, in addition to National POW/MIA Day. On all other days of the year the United States flag is flown as a symbol of our Nation and to honor all those who have served and whose service and sacrifice have kept our Nation free and strong. The Administration believes that the daily display of our National flag honors all America's veterans, including those who have not come home.
