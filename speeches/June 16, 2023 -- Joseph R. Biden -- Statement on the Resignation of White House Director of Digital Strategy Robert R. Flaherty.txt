    The way Americans get their information is changing, and since day one, Rob has helped us meet people where they are, while keeping a constant eye towards reaching new and different communities.
Under Rob's leadership, we've built the largest Office of Digital Strategy in history and, with it, a digital strategy and culture that brought people together instead of dividing them.
The integration of the digital team into senior White House leadership shows just how important Rob's team is for our daily engagement with the American people. His team has pioneered new methods of communication and operated with unparalleled creativity, innovative spirit, and a bias toward action.
I'm grateful to Rob for his service over the last 3Â½ years and look forward to our continued work together in the future.
