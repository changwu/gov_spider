    I am very pleased by today's announcement concerning Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. As I said at the beginning of this inquiry, Bruce Babbitt is a man of the highest integrity, and I was convinced that he would be vindicated. Secretary Babbitt's record of superb stewardship of our Nation's lands speaks for itself, and I look forward to his continuing service to our country, its people, and its extraordinary Godgiven resources.
