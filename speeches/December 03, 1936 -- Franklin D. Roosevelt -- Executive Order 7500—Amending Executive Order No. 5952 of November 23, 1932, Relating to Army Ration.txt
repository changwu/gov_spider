"Note 6.â€”In special cases where, due to local conditions, the unusually small size of the detachment, or the character of the work upon which the enlisted men are engaged, the allowances authorized in Note 5, above, are insufficient for the proper subsistence of the men, the Secretary of War is authorized to make such additional allowances as may be necessary, provided the total allowance thus authorized shall be less than the monetary allowance prescribed for subsistence for enlisted men when rations in kind are not furnished and Government messing facilities are provided."
This Order shall be effective immediately.
