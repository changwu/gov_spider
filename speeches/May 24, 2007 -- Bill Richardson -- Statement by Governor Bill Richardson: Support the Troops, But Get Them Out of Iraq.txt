    Governor Richardson calls today's vote on Iraq War funding a "missed opportunity"
SANTA FE, NM -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today issued the following statement regarding Congress preparing to pass proposed legislation that would provide continued funding for US military operations in Iraq without setting a timetable for withdrawing US troops.
"The best way to support our troops is to get them out of Iraq, and this bill will not move us any closer to that. The Democratic Congress is missing an opportunity. They should repeal the original resolution that gave the President the authority to take action against Iraq and replace it with one that requires the President to take all the troops out of Iraq by the end of the year. Congress has the authority to do that under Article One of the Constitution and under the War Powers Act and the President cannot veto it. Congress should not pass any appropriations beyond the date of de-authorization. By doing it that way, Congress would both fully fund our troops and get them out of Iraq as soon as possible."Â
