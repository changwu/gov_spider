    Joe Biden and the radical left have turned their back on our brave law enforcement officers, but President Donald J. Trump will always stand with our nation’s brave men and women in blue. The New York State Law Enforcement Officers Union, Council 82's endorsement of President Trump’s re-election follows the stark contrast between the Democrat Party's push to defund, dismantle, and abolish local police departments, and the Trump Administration’s strong commitment to law and order. Council 82 represents over 3,500 Police Officers, Deputy Sheriffs, County Correction Officers, State Correction Lieutenants, Emergency Dispatchers, and other Public Safety personnel across New York State.
"As law enforcement officers, we are inspired by your clear commitment to making our communities safe and secure, to cracking down on violent gangs and rioters, to restoring state and local law enforcement grant monies for additional hiring and access to surplus equipment, and enhancing safe neighborhood and public safety partnership programs," said Ronald Walsh, Council 82 President. "This election is so important for law enforcement and for our families. Council 82 proudly supports your re-election for President of the United States, and we pledge to support you every step of the way."
