    Buck O'Neil represented the best of America's national pastime. He devoted his long and full life to baseball and refused to allow injustice and discrimination to diminish his love of the game and his joyous, generous spirit. Laura and I extend our sympathies to his family and friends, and on behalf of all Americans, we give thanks for the life of one of the great ambassadors in baseball history.
