    Memorandum for the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of Energy
Subject: Presidential Determination on Proposed Agreement Between the United States of America and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
I have considered the proposed Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, along with the views, recommendations, and statements of the interested agencies.
I have determined that the performance of the agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the proposed agreement and authorize you to arrange for its execution.
