    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement effected by exchange of notes April 12, 1988, extending for the period of 2 years from July 1, 1988, until July 1, 1990, and amending to conform with current United States law the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the German Democratic Republic, signed at Washington on April 13, 1983. The exchange of notes together with the present Agreement constitute a Governing International Fishery Agreement within the requirements of Section 201(e) of the Act.
United States fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this Agreement, and, similarly, I request that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date to avoid disruption of ongoing cooperative fishing ventures.
Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, may not be available before the current Agreement is scheduled to expire, I recommend that the Congress consider passage of a joint resolution to bring into force the Agreement of April 12, 1988.
