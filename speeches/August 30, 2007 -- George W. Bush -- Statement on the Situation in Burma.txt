    I strongly condemn the ongoing actions of the Burmese regime in arresting, harassing, and assaulting prodemocracy activists for organizing or participating in peaceful demonstrations. These activists were voicing concerns about recent dramatic increases in the price of fuel, and their concerns should be listened to by the regime rather than silenced through force.
The Burmese regime should heed the international calls to release these activists immediately and stop its intimidation of those Burmese citizens who are promoting democracy and human rights. I also call on the regime to release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and to lift restrictions on humanitarian organizations that seek to help the people of Burma.
