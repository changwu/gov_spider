    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. released the following statement on the heels of the Trump campaign's lawsuit filed to ensure election integrity in Georgia:
"President Trump and his team are fighting for the good of the nation to uphold the rule of law, and Georgia's law is very clear: to legally count, mail ballots must be received by 7:00 p.m. on Election Day. That's still the law, even after Democrats sued earlier this year to extend the deadline and delay Election Dayâ€”President Trump and Republicans fought to uphold Georgia law, and we won.
"But today, a Republican poll observer in Georgia witnessed 53 late absentee ballots illegally added to a stack of on-time absentee ballots in Chatham County. We will not allow Democrat election officials to steal this election from President Trump with late, illegal ballots. President Trump and the Georgia Republican Party have filed suit to require all Georgia counties to separate any and all late-arriving ballots from all legally cast ballots to ensure a free, fair election in which only legal, valid ballots count.
"We look forward to the court swiftly resolving this issue and to President Trump's upcoming repeat win in Georgia."
- Justin Clark, Deputy Campaign Manager and Senior Counsel
