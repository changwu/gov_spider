"America is back to work," Biden declared after January jobs numbers surpassed expectations. The report showed 467,000 nonfarm jobs were added in January and more than 6.6 million since Biden took office.
The president's remarks also touched on conglomeration in the meat industry and other sectors, which he blamed for high prices. "Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It's exploitation," Biden said.
The president's speech began at roughly 11:50 am and concluded at 12:05 pm. He did not respond to shouted questions.

Walsh called the Biden administration the most pro-labor in history as he kicked off the event where Biden will sign an executive order expanding the federal government's use of project labor agreements for construction projects.
"It's always good to be in the house of labor," Harris said to cheers before transitioning to touting jobs numbers released earlier today. Harris said the nation's economic recovery continues to be "the strongest in the world."

Cranita Jordan, a fourth-year apprentice ironworker, introduced President Biden, who she called "a lifelong friend of workers like me."
Biden begins his remarks by recounting the story of the first union to endorse him and how when he went out to a job site there were workers sitting on an elevated beam like three of workers right now. "You're nuts," Biden jokes.

POTUS Pool Report 16
"You guys really are genuinely the best in the world. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact," Biden told the unionized ironworkers in the audience. He said adopting the project labor agreements for federal constructions will ensure safety, prevent problems and ultimately save U.S. taxpayers money. He said the executive order will "defuse problems before they arise."
Biden then moved onto discussing last week's Pittsburgh bridge collapse. "We can't count on miracles," he said noting that no one was killed in the collapse. "But we can count on the American worker," he added.
