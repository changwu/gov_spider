    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today the second annual report on the location of new Federal facilities in areas of low population density.
This report describes the second year efforts of all executive departments and agencies with respect to the location of new offices and other facilities in low population density areas as required by the Agricultural Act of 1970. This Administration is committed to both the revitalization of rural America and the maintenance of a sound balance between rural and urban America. This commitment is reflected by the data in this report showing that during the last year more than half of all newly located offices and other facilities have been placed in areas of lower population density.
The philosophy of this administration concerning the location of Federal facilities was expressed in Executive Order 11512 in February of 1970:
Consideration shall be given in the selection of sites for Federal facilities to the need for development and redevelopment of areas and the development of new communities, and the impact a selection will have on improving social and economic conditions in that area....
We have since moved to carry out this philosophy through a wide variety of actions. The Agricultural Act of 1970 serves as a further stimulus in the same direction. I am confident that our choice of locations for new offices and facilities is strengthening the balance between rural and urban America.
