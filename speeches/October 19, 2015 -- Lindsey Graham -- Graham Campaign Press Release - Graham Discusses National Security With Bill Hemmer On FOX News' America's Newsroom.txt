Alexandria, VA â€” This morning, Senator Lindsey Graham joined Bill Hemmer on Fox News' America's Newsroom to discuss national security and the incoherent foreign policy 'plans' of Ben Carson and Donald Trump. In case you missed it, watch the full interview here.

Graham: "If You Don't Take The Taliban Down After 9/11, Then You Don't Understand The War...Trump And Carson Both Said They Would Not Have Gone Into Afghanistan After 9/11."

"At the end of the day, I don't blame George W. Bush. But I would ask both of our front-runners to sit down with General Keane, General Petraeus and others and get a briefing about how the world actually works...
"If you don't understand we don't have enough troops to change the tide of battle in Iraq, you're not ready for this job. So at the end of the day, none of our candidates are making a whole lot of sense to me."
