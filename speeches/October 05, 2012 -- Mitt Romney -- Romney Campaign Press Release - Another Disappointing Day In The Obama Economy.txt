Business Startups Are Generating Fewer Jobs Than During The Recession. "Despite glimmers of good news for job creation, the state of America's startups presents a troubling sign: There are fewer of them, and those that exist are hiring fewer workers. ... Historically, new companies have generated 3 million net new jobs every year. That fell to 2.5 million during the recession, and recent government figures suggest it's only gotten worse. As for how many jobs they create, Tim Kane, an economist at the Hudson Institute, found a sharp decline."(Jose Pagliery, "Entrepreneurship Is 'Weaker Than Ever'," CNN Money, 10/5/12)

And This Generation Won't Be The Only Ones Paying The Price â€” The Next Generation Will Be Forced To Pay Off Yet Another Trillion-Dollar Deficit:
Today, The Congressional Budget Office Estimated That The FY2012 Deficit Totaled $1.1 Trillion. "A new estimate puts the deficit for the just-completed 2012 budget year at $1.1 trillion, the fourth straight year of trillion dollar deficits on President Barack Obama's watch. The result was a slight, $207 billion improvement from the 2011 deficit of $1.3 trillion. The bleak figures from the Congressional Budget Office, while expected, add fodder for the heated presidential campaign, in which Obama's handling of the economy and the budget is a main topic."
