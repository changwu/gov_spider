    I congratulate President Ts. Elbegdorj on his success in the election held on Wednesday in Mongolia. President Elbegdorj has been an important leader in advancing democracy and freedom in his country and a key partner for the United States in Asia and globally. I look forward to working with him to further strengthen the friendship and ties between our two countries. Through its impressive democratic achievements and its progress on economic liberalization, Mongolia serves as a significant example of positive reform and transformation for peoples around the world.
