    Today, I have signed into law S. 914, the "Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research Act of 2020" (the "Act"). Section 103(b) of the Act amends section 12304(c) of the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of 2009 to provide that the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee shall develop and transmit to the Congress along with the President's annual budget a "coordinated, comprehensive budget" addressing certain elements of the system provided for by that earlier statute. This requirement to recommend legislative measures contravenes the Recommendations Clause, United States Constitution Article II, Section 3, which gives the President the constitutional prerogative to recommend to the Congress only such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient. My Administration will implement this provision in a manner consistent with the Recommendations Clause.
