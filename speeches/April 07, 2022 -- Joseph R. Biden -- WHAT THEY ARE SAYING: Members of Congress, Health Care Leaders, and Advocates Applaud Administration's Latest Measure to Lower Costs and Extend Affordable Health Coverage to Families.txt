    On Tuesday, to continue lowering costs for American families, President Biden signed an executive order to expand quality, affordable health care and the Administration proposed a rule to remedy the "family glitch." The proposed rule would make 200,000 people newly eligible for coverage through the Affordable Care Act and lower premiums for nearly 1 million Americans.
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. Tuesday's actions build upon existing efforts the Biden-Harris Administration has taken, including through the American Rescue Plan, to reduce costs for Americans and give them greater peace of mind.
Here's what they are saying:
Members of Congress
Speaker of the House, California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi: "President Biden's Executive Order today is a powerful step forward in Democrats' relentless work to lower families' health costs. With this bold action to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, nearly a million Americans will see lower premiums for their health insurance and hundreds of thousands of uninsured Americans will gain affordable coverage. The Affordable Care Act stands as a pillar of American health and financial security, alongside Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Through this executive action to deliver affordable health coverage to those families who only have unaffordable coverage options at work, we are realizing a key priority of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act passed by the House Democratic Majority in 2020. Now, more families will have lower health costs and more money in their pockets each month. Democrats will continue building on our work to lower health costs. Our American Rescue Plan dramatically lowered the cost of care under the ACA, saving families an average of $2,400 last year while helping more families find coverage during the pandemic. And we are continuing to fight to slash prescription drug prices across the board, including with our House-passed legislation to cap families' out-of-pocket cost for insulin at $35 per month. Thanks to the relentless leadership of President Biden and the Democratic Congress, health care is more affordable and accessible than ever before. Democrats are Building a Better America For The People – and we will never relent in our fight to bring down the burdensome health costs weighing heavy on America's families." [Statement, 4/5/22]
House Majority Leader, Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer: "I commend President Biden, alongside former President Obama and Vice President Harris, for signing an executive action today addressing the 'family glitch' that has long prevented many working families from accessing affordable health care. With today's executive order, coverage will become more affordable for nearly a million more Americans, and 200,000 more will gain coverage. Additionally, many hard-working families will see lower premiums. This builds on the success we have had strengthening the Affordable Care Act through enhanced subsidies in the American Rescue Plan, which have lowered premiums for 9 million Americans by an average of $50 per month per person. Democrats will continue the fight to bring down health care costs for Americans by protecting these subsidies, continuing the fight to lower prescription drug prices through negotiation, capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month, and working to expand access to affordable coverage for all." [Statement, 4/5/22]

Health Care Organizations
Gerald Harmon, President, American Medical Association: "With the announcement today, the Biden Administration has taken a crucial step in the campaign to cover the 5 million people who fall into the family glitch. The family glitch is inconsistent with the goals of the Affordable Care Act and unfairly penalizes family members of lower-income workers.

[Statement, 4/5/22]

Advocacy Leaders and Organizations

We applaud today's action from the Biden administration and will do everything we can to get this proposed rule over the finish line as soon as possible. For more than a decade, health advocates have been calling for today's change, and we are thrilled the Biden administration is taking this step for 5 million people. Fixing the family glitch is especially important for children, who make up more than half of those impacted and are at risk of missing well visits, vaccinations and other important care as a result." [Statement, 4/5/22]
Leslie Dach, Chair, Protect Our Care: "The Affordable Care Act is the gift that keeps on giving. Despite years of attacks by Republican lawmakers, the law is stronger than ever and a record number of Americans have enrolled in affordable coverage. Democrats have proven time and again that the ACA lowers health costs and improves care. President Biden has reduced insurance premiums, expanded coverage, tackled racial equity and is now closing 'the family glitch' — all by building on the Affordable Care Act." [Statement, 4/5/22]
Brad Woodhouse, Executive Director, Protect Our Care: "There has never been a more urgent time to lower health care costs, and President Biden is delivering again. Americans are sick and tired of choosing between paying the bills and getting the health care they need. The Biden administration understands the needs of working families, and today's announcement made clear that Democrats are committed to building on the strong foundation of the ACA to lower costs and give families the health care they deserve. What have Republicans proposed to lower health care costs and fight inflation? Not a damn thing." [Statement, 4/5/22]
Emily Gee, Vice President and Coordinator for Health Policy, Center for American Progress: "The Biden administration's action to fix the ACA's family glitch will allow over a million Americans without an affordable health coverage option to access the financial help they deserve. This rule will lower health care costs for low- and middle-income families that cannot afford employer-sponsored plan premiums. It will help the families of hard-working Americans, including some of the 2.8 million children who are not eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Because of the new rule, about 200,000 people who are uninsured will finally gain access to comprehensive, affordable coverage. The new policy will also reduce premium costs for others who already have health insurance coverage." [Statement, 4/5/22]
John Arensmeyer, Founder and CEO, Small Business Majority: "We are glad that the Biden Harris administration is taking steps to fix the so-called 'family glitch' in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This issue has plagued the small business community for years and has kept more than 5 million people from qualifying for subsidized healthcare plans and accessing cost-sharing reductions for marketplace coverage. By addressing the family glitch, more small business owners, their employees, and their families will be able to access and afford coverage. Under the current rules, the ACA provides financial assistance through the individual marketplace to customers who would otherwise spend more than 9.83% of their income on their company's health plan premium for employee-only coverage. Most of the people caught in the ACA's family glitch now are insured through an employer but are paying very high premiums. In turn, hardworking low- and middle-income families have been blocked from getting affordable healthcare coverage through the marketplace because they or their spouse have been offered unaffordable employer-sponsored coverage. We know that many small businesses want to offer affordable healthcare benefits to their employees, but they can't afford to do so. Indeed, our research has found that healthcare costs are one of the biggest challenges for small businesses. More than 1 in 3 small businesses said they have struggled to obtain health insurance coverage for themselves and their employees during the pandemic. Fixing the family glitch will help many in the small business ecosystem by allowing more individuals to switch to ACA marketplace coverage with premium assistance. This is an important step to improving healthcare affordability and expanding access to critical coverage." [Statement, 4/5/22]
Alan Balch, CEO, National Patient Advocate Foundation: "Families can spend, on average, three times as much on annual insurance premiums than an individual plan. As written, the family glitch was an oversight. In practice, though, it affected millions of Americans, keeping them uninsured or their premiums too high. The new rule will make navigating the system and understanding coverage options easier and more intuitive for families." [Statement, 4/5/22]
Frederick Isasi, Executive Director, Families USA: "Thanks to President Biden's action today, five million working families are on the path to affordable health care that they were previously denied because of a technicality and in direct contradiction of what the Affordable Care Act's authors intended. I was in the room negotiating that legislation and can say in no uncertain terms: years ago the Treasury Department got it wrong when they interpreted the law. Today's announcement is a long-overdue step that will help make health care more affordable for people who are just trying to get by. Parents and their children are lucky to have champions like President Biden and his team making sure that, even when other costs are increasing, their family will be able to afford to get care when they need it. Easing this burden on families is smart policy that will pay off over the long term by making it possible for people to see a doctor without it breaking the bank and before they wind up in the emergency room." [Statement, 4/5/22]
