    DES MOINES, IA â€” Today the Klobuchar campaign announced six new endorsements from influential community and party activists. Klobuchar has visited Iowa 18 times since announcing her candidacy for president, has earned endorsements from more current and former Iowa state legislators than any other candidate, and has visited half of the state's 99 counties. These endorsements illustrate Klobuchar's growing momentum in the state following the Steak Fry where hundreds of supporters rallied around her.
"I've been impressed with Amy Klobuchar since she was first elected and I'm proud to endorse her for President. She works across the aisle and is bipartisan in her approach to getting things done for our country, which is exactly what we need at this time in history. Because she is from the Heartland she understands that we need an even hand in dealing with issues like access to health care and supporting the farming community," said Mary Anne Kuhr, former Pottawattamie County Vice Chair and rural Democratic activist.
"Amy Klobuchar is a woman of integrity and intelligence," said Matthea Little Smith, social justice community activist, NAMI mental health trainer, and NAACP member. "As President, she'll enact strategic policies that help all Iowans - from those dealing with mental health issues to reforming our criminal justice system. I trust that she's the candidate who can achieve real results and bring our country together and that's why I'm endorsing her for President."
