    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Denmark, signed at Copenhagen on June 22, 1972. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. The Treaty is one of a new series of extradition treaties being negotiated by the United States and contains provisions for offenses of aircraft hijacking, narcotics, and conspiracy to commit listed offenses. The Treaty will make a significant contribution to the international effort to control narcotics traffic. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
