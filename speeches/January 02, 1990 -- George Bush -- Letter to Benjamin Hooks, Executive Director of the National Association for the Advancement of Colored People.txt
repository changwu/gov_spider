    On this the first day of a whole new decade, Barbara and I send to you our personal best wishes for a very happy new year and to the NAACP, I send my sincere hope that 1990 will be a great year for your most prestigious organization.
The recent bombings make it clear we have not totally beaten back the evils of bigotry and racial prejudice. We cannot let up in the fight against racism. Please assure your members I will see that the Federal Government does not let up as it works to bring the perpetrators of these hideous crimes to justice.
