    ST. LOUIS â€“ Bernie Sanders on Sunday issued the following statement after Donald Trump said he would look into paying the legal expenses for a man accused of sucker punching a protester at a rally:
"Donald Trump should not be condoning violence by paying the legal fees of a supporter who viciously attacked a protester at one of his rallies. He should tone down his rhetoric and condemn the violence of some of his supporters."
