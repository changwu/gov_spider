    Weekend of Action Begins Saturday June 1
DES MOINES, IOWA — As summer begins in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke's campaign is announcing a major organizing push in the nation's first caucus state. O'Rourke, who has held the most Iowa events and visited the most counties of any candidate this cycle, now has 37 organizing staff, and 44 Iowa staff overall.
The campaign's organizers are having conversations with Iowans in big cities and small towns across the state, and this weekend they will lead the campaign's first Statewide Weekend of Action. The Statewide Weekend of Action will have canvassing in regions across the state, in keeping with O'Rourke's unique style of campaigning everywhere.
Additionally, Beto and Amy O'Rourke will open the campaign's Linn County office on Saturday, June 8 during their first joint visit to the state. They will also attend Capital City Pride Festival and the Iowa Democratic Party's 2019 Hall of Fame Celebration, and more information will be released shortly about the trip. This trip follows O'Rourke's first CNN town hall at Drake University in Des Moines.
