    Today, the Trump Campaign is pleased to announce the expansion of the communications team. These additions look to further educate voters on Hillary's liberal track record of deception, and effectively communicate the campaign's message – that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will Make America Great Again.
The campaign has enlisted the services of Bryan Lanza, who will serve as the Deputy Communications Director for Surrogates. Mr. Lanza's focus will be on organizing and mobilizing Trump supporters in an effective way that allows Mr. Trump's America First message to resonate with voters. Mr. Lanza has served as a Chief of Staff for members of the California State Assembly and Senate. Most recently, Mr. Lanza served as Communications Director of the non-profit Citizens United.
Mr. Lanza will be the campaign's point of contact for campaign surrogates, and the media should contact him directly with any requests. His email is [email protected].
The campaign has also brought aboard Steven Cheung, who will serve as the campaign's Director of Rapid Response. Mr. Cheung's focus will be on keeping the campaign up to date on breaking news and pushing back on false or unbalanced reporting. Cheung has worked in communications on several Senate and gubernatorial campaigns, as well as the 2008 McCain-Palin presidential campaign. Mr. Cheung most recently served as the Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
These additions to the campaign will be critical to spreading Mr. Trump's message and defeating Hillary Clinton in November. The Trump Campaign will continue to build out the communications team as we head toward November 8th.
