Dear Mr. Ambassador:
When Secretary Dulles spoke to me of his wish to designate you to represent the United States under the general supervision of the Secretary of State in future disarmament negotiations, I told him that the proposal had my enthusiastic endorsement. I want you to know of my appreciation of your willingness to undertake this new and additional task and of my confidence that you will meet its challenge with the same diligence and ability you always have brought to your assignments
It will not be an easy task, I know. Of all the problems confronting our country and its government today, none is more vital than that of finding a way to relieve mankind of the burden of devising, developing and maintaining arms which could lead to mankind's self-destruction. The burden is not only a danger to life itself, but, because of its evergrowing cost, an increasing threat to the economic well-being and security of everyone.
The United States, together with like-minded nations, is determined to exert every effort to assure that obstacles, procedural or substantive, not continue to interrupt our genuine striving to remove these threats from the daily lives of all the peoples of the world.
I personally follow this matter with the keenest interest and shall follow closely the progress of your task, in which you carry with you my cordial best wishes.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
The Honorable James J. WadsworthDeputy United States Representative to the United Nations
