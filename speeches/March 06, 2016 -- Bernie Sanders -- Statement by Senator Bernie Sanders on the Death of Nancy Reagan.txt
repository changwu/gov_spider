    DETROIT â€” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Sunday on the passing of former first lady Nancy Reagan:
"No matter your party or political ideology, this is a sad day for America. Nancy Reagan was an exemplary first lady. A devoted partner, she was her husband's most trusted advisor and, as such, served our country well. Even after her time in the White House, she was an outspoken advocate for stem-cell research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. Nancy Reagan had a good heart, and she will be dearly missed."
