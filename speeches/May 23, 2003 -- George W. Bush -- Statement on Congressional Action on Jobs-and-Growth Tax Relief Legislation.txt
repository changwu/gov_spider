    I commend the House and Senate for acting in a bipartisan fashion to bring tax relief to American families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. In passing this jobs-and-growth plan, Congress has taken a major step forward in the effort to boost economic growth and create jobs. One hundred thirty-six million taxpayers, including 12 million seniors and 23 million small-business owners, will directly benefit from this plan. A married couple with two children and household income of $40,000 will see their taxes cut by 96 percent this year. A growing economy is an urgent priority for all Americans, and I look forward to signing this bill and to seeing that tax relief is felt in paychecks quickly.
