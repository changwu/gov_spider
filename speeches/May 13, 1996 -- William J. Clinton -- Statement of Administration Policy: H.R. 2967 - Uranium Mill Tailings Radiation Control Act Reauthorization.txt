(House)(Schaefer (R) CO)
The Administration supports H.R. 2967, with the exception of section 3, which would increase reimbursements to licensees of active uranium and thorium processing sites for site remediation. Such reimbursements are funded by the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund which is capitalized by the Federal Government and the nuclear utilities industry. The Fund also finances the remediation of Federal uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Increasing reimbursements to site licensees, as provided for under section 3, would severely jeopardize the Government's ability to adequately fund Federal facility remediation. The Administration will work in the Senate to delete section 3 from H.R. 2967.
