So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST!Retweets: 36136Favorites: 142978

Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery. If D's oppose this deal they aren't serious about DACA-they just want open borders. https://t.co/XDMcDOr9vMRetweets: 23645Favorites: 89740

We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system. Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. https://t.co/rP9Gtr2E5NRetweets: 25680Favorites: 92746
