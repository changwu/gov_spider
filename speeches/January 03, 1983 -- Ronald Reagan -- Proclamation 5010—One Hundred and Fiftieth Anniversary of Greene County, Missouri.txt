  A Proclamation

The year 1983 marks the sesquicentennial anniversary of the founding of Greene County, Missouri.
Greene County, named for the Revolutionary War hero General Nathanael Greene, has enjoyed a long and distinguished history. Many of its sons and daughters have held high public office and otherwise served the State of Missouri and our nation.
In 1833, Greene County included all of southwest Missouri and remains today an important cultural and economic center. As the third most populous county in the State of Missouri, it continues to grow and prosper.
The Congress of the United States, by House Joint Resolution 630, has requested and authorized the President of the United States to proclaim January 3, 1983, as the One Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary of Greene County, Missouri.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim January 3, 1983, as the "One Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary of Greene County, Missouri."
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this third day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
