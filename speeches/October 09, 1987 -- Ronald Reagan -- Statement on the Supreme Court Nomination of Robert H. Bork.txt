    I am pleased by Judge Bork's decision to go forward with his nomination for the Supreme Court. Over the last few weeks, there has been considerable discussion about Judge Bork. His opponents mounted an attack based on innuendos, mistruths, and distortions to shield Bob Bork's real record of integrity, decency, fairness, and, above all, judicial restraint.
Our efforts will be focused on setting the record straight with the American people. It is time to remove the special interests from the judicial selection process. It is time to stop those who are determined to politicize the judiciary and try to accomplish through the courts what they cannot accomplish through the legislature.
The American people want a Supreme Court Justice who interprets the law, not makes it, who is concerned about victim's rights, not just the rights of criminals. The time is now to set the record straight and to be accountable to the people, not the special interests.
