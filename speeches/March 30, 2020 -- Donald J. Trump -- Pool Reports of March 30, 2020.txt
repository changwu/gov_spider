In-town pool report #3: briefing still skedded for 5 pm
Just a reminder that briefing is still scheduled to begin at 5:00 pm. I will provide color, not quotes. Live TV and livestream from WH and major papers are available. We are gathering in Rose Garden.
Temps are being taken on our way in. Pink stickers for all who pass (which is everybody so far, as best I can tell). White House sound man has mic on a long boom so he is the only one handling it and he promises to keep it a safe distance from our mouths.--
