    To the Newspapers of the Nation:
The nation joins the editors, publishers and reporters of this country in observance of National Newspaper Week. No institution is more necessary to our way of life than a free press.
A sign of free government, a free press is a primary source of that government's strength. It informs the people so that they may well discharge their responsibilities as citizens. It provides them and their elected representatives with a wide range of fact and opinion which must be weighed by all who are concerned with the well-being of our country.
Those who struggle to keep America informed can enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that their contribution to the cause of freedom is mighty. They well deserve the respect and gratitude and support of all our people.
