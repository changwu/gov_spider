    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
As required by section 7 of the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act (Public Law 105-174) (the Levin Amendment), and section 1203 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I transmit herewith a report on progress made toward achieving benchmarks for a sustainable peace process.
In July 1999, I sent the second semiannual report to the Congress under Public Law 105- 174, detailing progress towards achieving the 10 benchmarks adopted by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) and the North Atlantic Council (NAC) for evaluating implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords. This report provides an updated assessment of progress on the benchmarks covering the period from July 1 through December 31, 1999.
In addition to the semiannual reporting requirement of Public Law 105-174, this report fulfills the requirements of section 1203 in connection with my Administration's request for funds for FY 2001.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
