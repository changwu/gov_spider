    There can be no greater tribute for a patriot than to say he spent his life serving his nation. General Matthew Ridgway was such a patriot. He fought for our liberty and in opposition to tyranny through two great conflicts, World War II and the Korean conflict. Through his efforts, General Ridgway became one of our most venerated military leaders. His greatest legacy is the freedom his tireless work helped preserve and promote.
Hillary and I wish to extend our condolences to Mrs. Ridgway and the rest of his family. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Matthew Ridgway, soldier and patriot.
