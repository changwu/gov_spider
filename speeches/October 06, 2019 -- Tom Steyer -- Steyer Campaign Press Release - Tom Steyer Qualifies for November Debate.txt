    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 6, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer officially qualified for the Democratic National Committee debate in November. A Fox News poll released this morning shows Steyer at 4% in South Carolina, making it his 4th qualifying poll. Steyer is one of only 7 candidates to qualify thus far for the November debate.
"Tom's support is accelerating faster than any other candidate in the field in the early states where voters have had a chance to hear his message, Tom is surging because he's not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating," Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves said. "Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November."
Steyer announced his campaign on July 9, and had already surpassed the necessary 165,000 donor threshold by the time the DNC had announced the minimum number needed. The Morning Consult poll has consistently shown Tom at 6% among early state voters.
