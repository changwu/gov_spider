    BATON ROUGE – As candidates call for new debate criteria, Governor Jindal has a new suggestion – make intelligence part of the criteria for the next Republican presidential debate.
Governor Jindal said, "Amidst all this chatter about criteria to participate in debates – I've got a suggestion.
"How about this – if you want to participate in the next Republican debate, you should be required to be smart enough to have a plan to replace Obamacare and restore freedom and sanity to America's health care system.
"I introduced a detailed plan to replace Obamacare over a year ago, and only one other candidate has even attempted to write a plan.
"Ted Cruz likes to try to shut down the government over Obamacare, but he's never even bothered to come up with a replacement plan.
"All the candidates complain about Obamacare and campaign against it, but they don't apparently have the smarts or the courage to produce their own plan.
"Most of these candidates simply have stale talking points on Obamacare and health care reform.
"The Democrats' government takeover of American health care is the most significant domestic policy event of the past decade, and is the tip of the spear in the drive toward transforming the American economy into a socialist economy.
"And yet, most of our candidates can't even figure out or think through how they would replace it.
"If you want to lead the free world, you should be required to tell the voters how you will do it."
