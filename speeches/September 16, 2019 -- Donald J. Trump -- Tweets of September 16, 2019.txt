'We cannot have what happened to this President happen again.' Joe DiGenova. 'It is time for Justice to come barreling in.' @LouDobbs Can you imagine that with everything going on in this World the Witch Hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along.

House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say OK lets look at everything else and all of the deals that 'Trump' has done over his lifetime. But it doesn't....Retweets: 16997Favorites: 72188

....work that way. I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress the 'Congressional Slush Fund' and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!Retweets: 17407Favorites: 67941

Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you Mr. President!) we are a net Energy Exporter & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don't need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas & in fact have very few tankers there but will help our Allies!Retweets: 16481Favorites: 71610

Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to China's big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER! Really bad for exports. No Inflation...Highest Interest Rates...Retweets: 10142Favorites: 43346

...The United States because of the Federal Reserve is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They can't believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed don't have a clue. And now on top of it all the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop Stimulus!Retweets: 8776Favorites: 36733

Remember when Iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their 'airspace' when in fact it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We'll see?Retweets: 19494Favorites: 80472

'Democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.' Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are will they 'move the goalposts' and is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts but I'll be able to figure it out!Retweets: 10879Favorites: 43806

They failed on the Mueller Report they failed on Robert Mueller's testimony they failed on everything else so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President. Good idea except I will and have always expected to lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS..Retweets: 20632Favorites: 87083

....for the privilege of being your President - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades.
