    Today's anemic job growth figure and 0.3 % jump in the unemployment rate are not just more stale economic statistics: they impact the aspirations, hopes and economic securities of scores of hard-working American families. It is long past time to change the Bush-Cheney's economic strategy of "too little too late" for all but the most privileged. We need a new beginning on the economy, and a President that never stops fighting to lift the jobs, wages, health care and aspirations of America's hard working families. This Administration continues to exalt its economy despite the fact that under its watch, poverty has risen, 7 million more Americans have lost health care, family incomes are down, and more than 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. That is because the wages and jobs and health care of America's middle class are invisible to them as long as the most privileged have gained.
As President, I will refocus our economic strategy around whether the middle class is benefiting from our economy. And I will work every day to ensure that hardworking families once again can get ahead.
