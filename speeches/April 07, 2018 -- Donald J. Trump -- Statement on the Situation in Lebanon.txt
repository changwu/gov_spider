    I send my greetings to those who participated in the April 3 "CEDRE" Investment Conference on Lebanon and the Lebanese people. Lebanon is a country facing countless challenges, including an unprecedented influx of refugees and the corrosive influence of Iran and Hizballah. But as we can see from the success of this conference, Lebanon is also a country with many friends and enormous potential.
I commend the Government of Lebanon's progress, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sa'ad Hariri, to address these pressing challenges. Lebanon has now passed a budget in two consecutive years, increased Lebanese Armed Forces deployments in the south, and defeated ISIS in Lebanon. And it will soon hold historic parliamentary elections. These are all steps toward improved governance and a more secure Lebanon.
I also welcome and support Lebanon's plans to strengthen its economy through its capital investment plan and its commitment to implement necessary reforms, including combatting corruption, increasing transparency, and improving accountability and fiscal management. Undoubtedly, Lebanon's ambitious set of infrastructure projects presents great opportunities to strengthen Lebanon's economy and enhance economic prospects for the whole country. American companies will look forward to the new opportunities that the capital investment plan will offer in Lebanon.
The United States is proud of our close ties with the Lebanese people and stands in support of Lebanon's efforts to strengthen its legitimate state institutions and develop an open, free economy that serves all Lebanese.
