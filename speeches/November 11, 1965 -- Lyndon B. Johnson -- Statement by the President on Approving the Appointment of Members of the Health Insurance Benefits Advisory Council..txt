    THE SUCCESS of this program which means so much to our older people will depend in considerable part on the help provided by the many professional groups and organizations who will contribute to its administration.
I am grateful to all those who have agreed to serve on this Council. Their contributions and the continued assistance of physicians and other members of the health professions will assure that the new health insurance program will operate for the greatest benefit of our 19 million older citizens.
