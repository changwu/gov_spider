    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124, I am forwarding reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on awards made during Fiscal Year 1978 to members of the Armed Forces for suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.
The participation of military personnel in the cash awards program was authorized by the Congress in 1965. More than two million submissions since that time attest to the program's success in motivating military personnel to find ways of reducing costs and improving efficiency. Of the suggestions submitted, more than 325,000 have been adopted, with tangible first-year benefits of more than a billion dollars.
Of the 98,011 suggestions submitted by military (including Coast Guard) personnel during Fiscal Year 1978, 14,830 were adopted. Cash awards totalling $1,001,257 were paid for adopted suggestions during Fiscal Year 1978. These awards were based not only on the tangible first-year benefits of $37,263,734 realized from adopted suggestions during Fiscal Year 1978, but also on many additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature.
Enlisted people received $820,006 in awards during Fiscal Year 1978, representing 81 percent of the total cash awards paid during the periods. Officers received $181,251 during Fiscal Year 1978.
The attached reports of the Secretaries of Defense and Transportation contain statistical information on the military awards program and brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions of military personnel during Fiscal Year 1978.
