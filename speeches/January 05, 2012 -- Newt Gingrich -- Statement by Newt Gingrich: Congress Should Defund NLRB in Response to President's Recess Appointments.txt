    Plymouth, NH – Speaking at the Plymouth Senior Center, Newt Gingrich denounced President Obama's recess appointments of three members of the National Labor Relations Board and a director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:
"The answer to an imperial president is a Congress which stands on its own rights.  And the correct response to what the president just did would be for the Congress to zero out and refuse to fund the National Labor Relations Board.
"The National Labor Relations Board now has a majority of members who were never confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  This is a clear violation of the spirit of the law, and Congress has an obligation to defend our rights, and the correct way is the power of the purse."
