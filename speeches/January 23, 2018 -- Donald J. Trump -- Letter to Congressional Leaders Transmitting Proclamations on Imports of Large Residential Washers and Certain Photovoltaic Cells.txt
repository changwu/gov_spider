In accordance with section 203(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act"), I hereby transmit documents to the Congress that describe the safeguard actions that I have proclaimed on imports of large residential washers and certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells (whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products), pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 203(a)(1) of the Act, and the reasons for taking these actions.
