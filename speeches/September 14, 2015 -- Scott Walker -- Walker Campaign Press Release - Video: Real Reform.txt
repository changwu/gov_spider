    Ahead of his town hall in Nevada where he will reveal his plans to address labor issues nationally, as he successfully did in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker released a new video today, "Real Reform." Building on his "Recall the Recall" message, this video highlights Walker's real, conservative reforms of limiting state unions, smaller class sizes, school district surpluses, implementing performance pay for state workers, reducing overtime costs, balancing the state budget, and achieving $3 billion in taxpayer savings.
