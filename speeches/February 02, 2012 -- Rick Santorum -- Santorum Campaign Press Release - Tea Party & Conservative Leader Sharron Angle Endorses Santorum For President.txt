    Las Vegas, NV - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce that it has received the endorsement of former U.S. Senate candidate and Nevada Tea Party leader Sharron Angle.
Sharron Angle said: "Rick Santorum and I have known each other for years. He is a strong fiscal and social conservative who stands on principles above politics. He has never wavered in his support for family values understanding the impact that strong families have on a prosperous economy. His continuous opposition to Amnesty, Obamacare, the bail-outs, and cap and trade are a perfect fit with our main street Tea Party movement."
Rick Santorum said: "Sharron Angle is a fighter, and proved how important it is to take the fight to liberals like Harry Reid. Despite tens of millions of dollars thrown against her, Sharron did not back down and stood tall for repealing Obamacare and for the traditional values that make America great. I am thrilled to receive her endorsement and I am confident it will be a terrific boon to our campaign as the Nevada Caucus approaches."
Sharron Angle has earned a national reputation as a strong fighter for conservatism and the Tea Party movement. Angle was first elected to office in 1992 to the Nye County School Board of Trustees and was then elected to the Nevada State Assembly in 1998, rising to the level of Majority Whip in the State Assembly. Angle was the 2010 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, coming within 5 points of defeating Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
