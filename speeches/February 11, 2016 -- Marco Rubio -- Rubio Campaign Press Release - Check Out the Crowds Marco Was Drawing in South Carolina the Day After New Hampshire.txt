His first stop: Spartanburg, SC, where he followed up the Congressman Trey Gowdy and Senator Tim Scott comedy routine with some jokes of his own, for a crowd of more than 600:

Here's some local TV coverage of the event:

Then it was off to the state capital, Columbia, where Marco supporters Scott and Gowdy got it started off again, for a crowd of more than 500:

Then, Marco had to head back to Washington for some important national security business — voting for sanctions on North Korea.
But State Senator Larry Grooms and Congressman Gowdy hosted one last Marco event.
Gowdy opens by apologizing that "Timmy & Marco" went back "to punish NK, and in the process you're being punished cause you're stuck w/me."

Gowdy emphasized how strongly he feels about his support for Marco, who he says is the best in the field on border security and national security:

Gowdy says no candidate is better than Rubio on national security.

Plus, he emphasized: Marco's the candidate we know will win.

By the way, Marco's not wasting a moment: On the flight down, he took some time to chat with some reporters:
