    New York, New York – In a speech today at Cooper Union, Senator John Edwards will unveil his plan to reduce the rising debt which is threatening our working and middle class families. Edwards will speak about the Two Americas that have grown further apart since the 2004 campaign—one America struggling to get by and build a better future and another that has everything it needs—and discuss how we can build One America that works for all Americans.
Edwards' plan will put our government and our economy back in line with our values and ensure economic security for families by taking on abusive lenders, creating a new Family Savings and Credit Commission on the side of families who are investing and borrowing, and giving families alternatives to high-cost debt.



    Edwards' remarks as prepared for delivery are available here.
