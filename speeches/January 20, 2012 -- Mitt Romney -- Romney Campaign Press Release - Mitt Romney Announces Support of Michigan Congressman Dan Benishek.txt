    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Congressman Dan Benishek.
 
"I'm proud to have Dan's support," said Mitt Romney. "Though he has not been in Congress very long, Dan has made his mark by being a staunch advocate for the same conservative policies that I look to implement as president. I look forward to working with him in the months to come as I spread my message of a simpler, smaller, and smarter federal government throughout my native state of Michigan and across the country."
"For my fellow Michiganders, this upcoming election is the most critical in generations. Our country simply cannot take four more years of President Obama's broken promises and failed policies. Mitt Romney shares the values that made me run for office in the first place: a willingness to take on Washington, a commitment to repeal Obamacare and a promise to end Washington's runaway spending. I urge all my fellow conservatives to reject four more years of a failed presidency and join me in supporting Mitt Romney."
