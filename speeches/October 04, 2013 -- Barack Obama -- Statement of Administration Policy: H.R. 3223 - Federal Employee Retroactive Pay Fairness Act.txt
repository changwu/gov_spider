(House)
(Rep. Moran, D-VA, Rep. Wolf, R-VA, and 151 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3223, the Federal Employee Retroactive Pay Fairness Act. Once the Government is funded, the bill would retroactively compensate Federal employees furloughed as a result of any lapse in appropriations beginning on October 1, 2013, for the period of the lapse. Federal workers keep the Nation safe and secure and provide vital services that support the economic security of American families. The Administration appreciates that the Congress is acting promptly to move this bipartisan legislation and looks forward to the bill's swift passage.
This bill alone, however, will not address the serious consequences of the funding lapse, nor will a piecemeal approach to appropriations bills. The House of Representatives should allow a straight up or down vote on Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59, to fund the Government and bring the Nation's dedicated civil servants back to work.
