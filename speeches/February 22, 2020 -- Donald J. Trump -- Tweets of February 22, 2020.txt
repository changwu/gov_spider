....The reason for this is that the Do Nothing Democrats, using disinformation Hoax number 7, don't want Bernie Sanders to get the Democrat Nomination, and they figure this would be very bad for his chances. It's all rigged, again, against Crazy Bernie Sanders!Retweets: 11160Favorites: 44973

MSDNC (Comcast Slime), @CNN and others of the Fake Media, have now added Crazy Bernie to the list of Russian Sympathizers, along with @TulsiGabbard & Jill Stein (of the Green Party), both agents of Russia, they say. But now they report President Putin wants Bernie (or me) to win.Retweets: 15911Favorites: 61372

Democrats in the Great State of Nevada (Which, because of the Economy, Jobs, the Military & Vets, I will win in November), be careful of Russia, Russia, Russia. According to Corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff, they are pushing for Crazy Bernie Sanders to win. Vote!Retweets: 22037Favorites: 96184

Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden & the rest look weak, & no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie, & don't let them take it away from you!Retweets: 25476Favorites: 128824
