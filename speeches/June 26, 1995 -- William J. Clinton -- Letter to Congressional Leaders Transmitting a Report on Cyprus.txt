    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through March 31, 1995. The current report covers April 1, 1995 through May 31, 1995.
The central event of this period was the May 21-23 exploratory talks between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. These talks were held in London and facilitated by Presidential Emissary Beattie and Special Cyprus Coordinator Williams. The talks laid the groundwork for a second visit to the island by Mr. Beattie to explore possible areas of agreement between Greek-Cypriot leader Clerides and Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
