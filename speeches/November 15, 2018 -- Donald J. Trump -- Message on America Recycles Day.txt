    On America Recycles Day, our Nation renews its commitment to reducing, reusing, and recycling waste in ways that contribute to the continued growth of our economy and the responsible stewardship of our environment.
The United States recycling rate has made tremendous progress over the last 50 years, growing considerably and marking a change in the disposal habits of many Americans. In addition to changes in consumer behavior, American industry is doing its part by reusing supplies and equipment and recycling waste to help produce energy or new materials. These advancements in efficiency, coupled with the visionary ideas of entrepreneurs and the unmatched ingenuity of American workers, prove why American businesses continue to create the world's greatest products while also lessening their environmental impact.
Today, recycling efforts continue to instill the great principles of conservation and accountability in our Nation. We can continue this progress by redoubling our efforts to ensure resilient local recycling systems that support our economy and our environment. Together, we can reduce waste and ensure our Nation more efficiently utilizes our resources as we build a stronger America for future generations.
