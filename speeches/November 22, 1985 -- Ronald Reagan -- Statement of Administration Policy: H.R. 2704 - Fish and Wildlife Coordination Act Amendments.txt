    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Breaux (D) Louisiana and three others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2704, because:
— the requirement for Federal project agencies to pay for all mitigation studies performed by the Departments of Commerce and the Interior could restrict the Government's ability to obtain basic environmental information in the most timely and cost-effective manner;
— the reporting requirements are excessively burdensome and insufficiently focused to provide good information; and
— the authorization for long-term mitigation planning agreements with State, local, and private organizations is unnecessary and unduly restrictive.
Accordingly, the Administration recommends that H.R. 2704 be removed from the suspense calendar, so that these objections may be taken into account during House floor consideration of the bill.
