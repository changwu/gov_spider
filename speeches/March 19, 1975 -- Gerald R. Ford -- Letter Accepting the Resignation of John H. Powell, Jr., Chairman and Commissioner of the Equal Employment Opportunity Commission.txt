    Dear John:
I have your letter dated March 18, and as you request, I accept your resignation as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, effective today, and your resignation as a Commissioner, effective April 30, 1975. I appreciate your willingness to stay on as a member of the Commission during the next month to assist in the orderly transfer of authority to the Acting Chairman and to provide a period of time in which a well-qualified nominee to replace you can be selected.
I want to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation for your dedicated service to our Nation. Under your Chairmanship, the Commission has broken new ground, expanding the economic and social horizons of all our citizens. I know that this has been a particularly challenging time for the Commission, but your devotion to the goals of the Commission and to the present and future well-being of every American has not faltered. You have earned their thanks as well as my own.
As you depart the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, I want you to know that you take with you my very best wishes for every future happiness and success.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[The Honorable John H. Powell, Jr., Chairman, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1800 G Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20506]
