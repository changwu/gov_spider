    Normally I don't have much to say at these meetings with the press. We do that in the press room. But I do want to thank you all for coming. I'm anxious to hear what you've discussed with Governor Sununu.
But I want to take this opportunity to tell you something that bothers me because I've heard from some and then I've read accounts that suggest Arab-Americans in this country, because of the conflict abroad, are being discriminated against, and it's causing pain in families in this country. And there is no room for discrimination against anybody in the United States of America. And I want you to suggest to me if there are things that I can do as President to get that message out loud and clear to every Arab-American; whether he agrees with me on this war or not is unimportant.
The message is: There is no place for discrimination in the United States of America. And if there's anybody in the communities around this country that are being hurt by it, we have got to come together and do everything we can to see that it doesn't go on.
And secondly, on the war, I know there may be some divisions of one kind or another; that's fine. But it is going well, and I am more determined than ever to bring this to a successful conclusion. And the coalition is working very well, holding together with great strength and great conviction. And I want to tell you a little more about that now when we get into the substance of our meeting here.
But, again, thank you all for coming. Many thanks for coming back. I'm glad to have you here always.
