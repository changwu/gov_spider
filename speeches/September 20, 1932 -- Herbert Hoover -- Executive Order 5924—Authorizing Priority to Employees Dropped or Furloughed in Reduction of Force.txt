    The Civil Service Commission may set up procedure and promulgate regulations under which employees with appropriate status who have been recently or who are about to be furloughed or dropped for reduction of force without delinquency or misconduct may be afforded priority in the filling of vacancies when in the opinion of the commission the conditions of good administration warrant such priority.
This order supersedes the Executive orders of November 29, 1918; April 30, 1919; January 28, 1927, and February 18, 1927, referring to reemployment; and the Executive instruction of October 12, 1931, relating to transfers.
