    Barbara and I are deeply saddened by the news of the plane crash today in Pennsylvania in which U.S. Senator John Heinz and others have been killed. While all of the facts about this tragic accident are still unclear, our condolences go out to the families of all those killed or injured.
The people of Pennsylvania have lost a great leader, and the Nation has lost a great Senator. In particular, his steadfast efforts to protect Social Security and health care benefits for the elderly, his work to ensure both free and fair trade with our trading partners, and his commitment to protecting the environment have touched the lives of all Americans. His leadership and commitment will be greatly missed.
Adding to this tragedy is the apparent loss of life of at least two schoolchildren killed when the wreckage hit the ground and those piloting the aircrafts involved in the accident.
John Heinz was a close friend of our family. Barbara and I join the citizens of Pennsylvania and all Americans in extending sympathy and prayers to his wife, Teresa, and his sons, John, Andre, and Chris. Our hearts go out to the families in Merion, PA, who have suffered loss as a result of the accident.
