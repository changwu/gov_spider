    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu's call to the international community to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
"Today, the government of Israel reiterated the reality that the Golan Heights are part of Israel's sovereign territory. Given the presence of hostile terrorist organizations ranging from ISIS to Hezbollah on Israel's northern border, it is foolhardy and dangerous for elements in the international community to try to pressure Israel to abandon the Golan to the chaos engulfing Syria. The path to peace cannot involve Israel's abdication of its own security.
"I applaud Prime Minister Netanyahu's courage in standing up for the safety of his people. America stands with you."
