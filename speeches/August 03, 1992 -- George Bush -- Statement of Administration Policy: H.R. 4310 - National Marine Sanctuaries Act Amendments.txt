    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Hertel (D) Michigan and 9 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 4310, which would strengthen the marine sanctuaries program, but will work in the Senate for amendments to:

— Delete provisions designating individual sanctuaries or regulating activities in individual marine sanctuaries. Those provisions would bypass congressionally established administrative procedures concerning designation and management of sanctuaries.
— Delete the earmarking of funds. Earmarking would severely restrict other important activities, including designation of new sanctuaries and central management responsibilities.
— List the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States (generally the area 200 miles from the shore) as an area in which the marine sanctuaries program applies, and is enforceable in accordance with international law. This will clarify that marine sanctuaries located in whole or in part in the EEZ are covered.
— Delete provisions requiring grants for the acquisition of space in Hatteras Village, North Carolina. Funding specific activities or sanctuary operations does not recognize competing priorities within the national marine sanctuaries program. 
The Administration also questions the advisability of naming a sanctuary for an individual, which would set a precedent.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4310 would increase receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 4310 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
