    Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: FY 2001 Refugee Admissions Consultations
In accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), you are authorized to consult with the appropriate committees of the Congress concerning refugee admissions as follows:
1. The authorization of 80,000 refugee admissions, 76,000 of which are funded, during FY 2001, which would be allocated by specific region as follows: 20,000 for Africa; 6,000 for East Asia (including Amerasians); 3,000 for Latin America and the Caribbean; 10,000 for the Near East and South Asia; 37,000 for Europe (including 20,000 for the former Yugoslavia and 17,000 for the former Soviet Union); and 4,000 for the unallocated reserve. The recommended level of funded admissions is equal to the level assumed in the FY 2001 budget request (76,000).
2. The authorization of an additional 10,000 refugee admission numbers to be made available for the adjustment to permanent resident status of persons who have been granted asylum in the United States.
3. The designation, pursuant to section 101(a)(42)(B) of the INA, of persons in Cuba, Vietnam, and the former Soviet Union, who, if they otherwise qualify for admission as refugees, may be considered refugees under the INA even though they are still within their country of nationality or habitual residence.
