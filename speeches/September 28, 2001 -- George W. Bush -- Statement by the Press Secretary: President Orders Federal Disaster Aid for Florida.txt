    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Florida and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes and flooding associated with Tropical Storm Gabrielle on September 13-21, 2001.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected local governments in a seven county area. The counties include Charlotte, DeSoto, Hardee, Manatee, St. Johns, Sarasota and Flagler.
Federal funding is available to eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes and flooding associated with Tropical Storm Gabrielle. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Charles M. Butler as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
