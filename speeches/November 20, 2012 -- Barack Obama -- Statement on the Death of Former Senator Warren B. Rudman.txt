    With the passing of Warren Rudman, the United States has lost a decorated war veteran and one of our country's great public servants. Over almost 20 years representing the people of New Hampshire, first as attorney general and then in the Senate, Warren was the embodiment of Yankee sensibility and New England independence. As an early advocate for fiscal responsibility, he worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to call attention to our Nation's growing deficit. And as we work together to address the fiscal challenges of our time, leaders on both sides of the aisle would be well served to follow Warren's example of commonsense bipartisanship. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Rudman family.
