    Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the Supreme Court's decision to rule on United States v. Texas, which will determine whether millions of individuals can obtain deferred action through President Obama's executive actions.
"President Obama's executive actions on immigration are an exercise of long-standing executive authority, and the Supreme Court should uphold them. The stakes for families couldn't be higher. As President, I will implement DAPA and DACA, expand on these efforts to provide relief to more families, and continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform."
