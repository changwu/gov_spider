    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee today announced the support of nearly one hundred firefighters from across South Carolina. South Carolina Firefighters for Rudy represents first responders from across the state who will help build the coalition and communicate Mayor Giuliani's proven record and optimistic vision. The coalition will be chaired by Lewis Hayes, Chief of the Croft Fire Department.
Chief Hayes said, "Rudy Giuliani is the decisive and experienced leader we need to achieve solutions to the challenges our country currently faces. It takes a determined leader to make the kind of transformation he achieved as Mayor of New York â€” and his record speaks for itself. This is the leadership that makes me proud to be part of the Mayor's campaign.
"Mayor Giuliani's unwavering support for New York's firefighters, police officers and emergency workers demonstrated his deep respect for our efforts. We're proud to support Mayor Giuliani for President and look forward to helping his efforts in South Carolina," Hayes concluded.
Today's announcement comes after a recent town hall meeting Giuliani hosted at the firehouse in North Spartanburg organized by the South Carolina State Firefighters Association and attended by nearly 300 first responders.
"Every day men and women are working in difficult circumstances to keep us safe and I'm honored to have the support of this brave group from across South Carolina," Giuliani said.
