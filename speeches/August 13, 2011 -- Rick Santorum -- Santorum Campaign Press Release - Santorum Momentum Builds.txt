Ames, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) far exceeded expectations in Ames and finished 4th in the Ames Straw Poll.
Today's results were simply vindication for Senator Santorum's belief that a clear, consistent and proven conservative record resonates with Americans. Outspent in Iowa by more than six to one in comparison to his nearest competitors, Senator Santorum showed that leadership trumps showmanship and that the American people deserve more than just television commercials, news conferences and empty promises.
Voters expect to meet the candidates, kick the tires, and then determine who is best suited to take on President Obama. Rick Santorum visited 68 of Iowa's 99 counties, holding 111 town hall meetings and rallies in libraries, coffee shops, and even living rooms. Unlike President Obama who wants the American people to believe in government, Rick Santorum believes in the American people, which is exactly why he took his message straight to the people and they overwhelmingly responded.
"I am incredibly grateful for the overwhelming support our campaign received today," said SenatorSantorum. "The press and pundits had written us off and chose to ignore our message. But voters rallied around our message, that America will be great again if we elect a President who has the record of results through proven leadership. Today, the people of Iowa sent shock waves through the political establishment and our success though does not end here in Ames today, but moves forward to the Caucuses and beyond.
