    This week, the White House released the first-ever comprehensive National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. The National Action Plan (NAP) represents the broad-based, multi-disciplinary, whole-of-government strategy of the United States to eradicate human trafficking. This plan is built around the three pillars laid out in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000: Prevention, Protection, and Prosecution. The NAP's fourth pillar recognizes the invaluable benefit of implementing collaborative and cooperative efforts that crosscut all three pillars and involve a multitude of stakeholders and professionals from various disciplines and sectors. Under the heading of each pillar, the NAP identifies foundational principles and associated priority action items.
Human trafficking is an intolerable blight on any society that values freedom, individual rights, human dignity, and the rule of law. The Trump Administration is committed to leveraging every resource we have to confront this threat, support victims, and hold traffickers accountable.
