    New York, NY – After the end of the Democratic debates in Miami, Governor Bullock released the following statement:
"Over the last two nights, it was clear that these debates were missing an important voice. As the only candidate who's won and governed a Trump state — and the only one who's passed progressive policies through a majority-Republican legislature even in these divided times — I can tell you that we can't discount these perspectives if we're ever going to beat Trump and get America back on track. I look forward to joining my colleagues in Detroit next month to discuss our plans to bring all Americans together to ensure a fair shot for everyone."
Governor Bullock spent the last two days taking his case directly to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. He participated in televised town halls broadcast by WHO-TV in Des Moines and WMUR in Manchester.
