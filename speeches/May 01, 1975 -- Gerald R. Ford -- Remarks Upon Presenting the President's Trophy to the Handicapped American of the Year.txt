    Thank you very much, Harold, for greeting me and giving me an opportunity to say a word or two to our distinguished guest, Elton Ringsak, the Handicapped American of the Year.
I am very delighted to meet with you and to meet Elton. All of the people in this room, of course, are very familiar with the great problems that face the handicapped. And one of those problems you recognize, as well if not better than I, is the lack of understanding on the part of many Americans of the problems that handicapped people face in this country.
I think there is also a problem that the American people don't understand, and that is the great courage and the strength that handicapped people have. They may be handicapped physically, but their spirit and their determination make up, in most cases, for the problems that they have physically.
I know that our honored guest today has done a superb job in his State in attaining the enactment of legislation, in convincing people in his State that there can be real progress in making job opportunities a better life for those who are handicapped physically.
So, I commend you, Elton, for this great award, and I thank you for what you have done over the years. This recognition is a proper tribute to you, but all of us should be extremely thankful for what you have done and I am sure will continue to do.
And so, on behalf of the American people, I thank you for this service and commend you for this award.
