    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of St. Louis Mayor Francis G. Slay.
"From her days in Arkansas to her current tenure in the United States Senate, Hillary Clinton has demonstrated that she understands why cities matter and has shown a strong grasp of the challenges and opportunities before us," Slay said. "She values what I value: safer, stronger neighborhoods; a better future for all of our children; and good jobs. If Senator Clinton becomes President Clinton, I know St. Louis will have a strong advocate in the White House."
Under Slay's leadership, St. Louis has added $4 billion in new investment and seen property values rise 70% since he was elected Mayor in 2001. St. Louis' population is growing for the first time in five decades, and Slay has implemented new initiatives to revitalize neighborhoods, reduce homelessness and improve the city's school system.
Prior to being elected Mayor, Slay served as a St. Louis Alderman for 10 years, then as President of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen from 1995 to 2001.
"Francis Slay is one of a new breed of mayors who are revitalizing their cities and setting an example for the rest of the country," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support."
