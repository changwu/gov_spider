    The President on Friday afternoon convened a call with Texas Governor Rick Perry, Texas Health Commissioner Dr. David Lakey, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, and Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to mark the end of the 21-day monitoring period for all of those in Dallas potentially exposed to Ebola. The President, who earlier in the day received an Ebola update from his team, noted that, with this milestone, those in Dallas who came into contact with Thomas Duncan, the since-deceased Ebola patient, or nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, among the healthcare professionals who so heroically tended to him, are no longer at risk of developing the disease. The President offered his gratitude to all four for the leadership they consistently displayed throughout this challenging and uncharted experience. He underscored that they were true and indispensable partners, and that the federal, state, and local cooperation that emerged now serves as a national model. The President also extended his appreciation to local public health officials as well as to the people of Dallas whose strength and resilience helped reassure the nation.
