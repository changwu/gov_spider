    American soldiers have been captured or have become missing in action during each of our country's wars.
The agony of their families has been incalculable. The prisoners themselves have suffered deprivation, starvation, abuse, torture, and sometimes death at the hands of their captors.
Their heroism in the face of these afflictions has often been greater than the heroism of men in battle; the prisoner's battle to preserve life, dignity, and honor can go on day after painful day, sometimes for years.
And the anguish suffered by the families of Americans missing in action is prolonged by lack of certainty over the fate of a husband or son or grandson or brother.
I am proud to sign a bill honoring these Americans who have given so much and endured so much. Many of them have won through to become some of America's finest citizensâ€”like the former prisoner of war who is one of the sponsors of this bill, Senator Hathaway. I join all Americans in gratefully recognizing their sacrifices.
