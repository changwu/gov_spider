    Q. Mr. President, there is a new poll showing you up on Ronald Reagan by a point or two.
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, really? I haven't paid much attention to polls when I was behind. I don't think I'll start now.
Q. What do you think put you up?
THE PRESIDENT. It's hard to say whether we're up or down. But I think the American people, here a few days before the election, are beginning to pay much more attention to the issues between me and Governor Reagan and not so much to the debate format or whether there are two or three on the stage together or what the poll results say or what who said about whom. But the seriousness of this campaign and the effect on the future, I believe, is going to have a
beneficial effect in the coming days for me.
Q. Any fear you'll peak too soon?
THE PRESIDENT. No, not with just a one point difference. That's not much.
Q. Do you think you have the momentum now?
THE PRESIDENT. I hope so.
Q. You come back.
THE PRESIDENT. I'll be back.
