Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997 or 21 years. The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S. 'you would need a magic wand.' I guess I found the MAGIC WAND - and it is only getting better!Retweets: 26899Favorites: 113479

If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are 'immoral' why isn't she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging.
