    American manufacturers and industry groups are calling for swift passage of legislation like USICA and the America COMPETES Act to strengthen our supply chains, bring more manufacturing back to the United States, and allow us to out-compete China and the rest of the world in the 21st century.
The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) announced today their support for quick House passage of additional support for semiconductor manufacturing included in the COMPETES Act, with MEMA President Bill Long stating that passing that legislation will "help level the semiconductor playing field for the U.S. with competitors around the globe."
Competitiveness legislation has been endorsed by labor and business alike, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, Intel, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and the National Association of Manufacturers all calling on Congress to act. This broad coalition reflects the crucial importance of these measures for making the future right here in America, investing in our sources of innovation and bringing them to factory floors, and addressing the sort of supply chain bottlenecks like semiconductors that have led to rising prices for working families.
