Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today on International Holocaust Remembrance Day:
"Today, we remember all those who perished in the evil done during one of the darkest chapters in our history. On this day 62 years ago, the largest and most infamous of the concentration camps at Auschwitz was liberated by Allied Forces.
"We remember the millions who died and honor the work of Holocaust survivors, their descendants and all who ensure that the world never forgets this great tragedy and prevents similar acts from taking place again.
"However, in some dark corners of our world, we are seeing the calculated manipulation of history. This must be met with our collective voice and vigilance to ensure that we never again witness the horrors of the Holocaust."
