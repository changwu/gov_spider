    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) MT)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the ACTION agency's programs and has transmitted legislation to accomplish that objective. The Administration, however, opposes H.R. 4116 unless it is amended to:
— reduce the bill's excessive authorization levels, which exceed the Administration's budget request by about $29 million for fiscal year 1987, and by about $104 million over the three years 1987-1989;
— remove the proposed establishment of a VISTA Literacy Corps which is an unnecessary, duplicative new program;
— delete the statutory requirement for a specified minimum number of VISTA volunteers each year; and
— incorporate amendments proposed by the Administration.
