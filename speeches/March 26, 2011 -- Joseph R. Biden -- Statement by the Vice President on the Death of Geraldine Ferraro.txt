    It's with deep sadness that Jill and I reflect today on the passing of a truly tremendous figure in our nation's history. It was Gerry's pioneering spirit that inspired a new generation of women leaders -- both at home and around the world. I had the pleasure to serve with her in Congress, where I quickly learned her clear-eyed passion for justice and equality would be her enduring trademark. From the classroom to the national campaign trail, and everything in between, she never once abandoned the ideals that brought her to Washington. On behalf of Jill and me, our thoughts and prayers go out to John and her entire family.
