    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2008 Budget amendments for the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and Transportation, as well as the Legal Services Corporation. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2008 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
This transmittal also contains FY 2007 proposals and FY 2008 Budget amendments for the Legislative Branch. As a matter of comity between branches, appropriations requests of the Legislative Branch are transmitted without change.
The details of these amended requests and proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
