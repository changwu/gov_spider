    LET ME first congratulate Alma and Lindy, and let me welcome all of you nationalists and federalists here in Washington, D.C.
Let me congratulate the 100 of you from the 49 States and the District of Columbia. I think it is a wonderful experience for all of you, and I know that the opportunities you have had to come to the White House, to go to the courts, and to go to the Congress have given you a better appreciation of how our Government does work.
I couldn't help but notice that in the 6 hours that you had a congressional session, that you passed 20 bills on the environment and energy and the economy. I hope in your visit up to Capitol Hill you told the Congress how things can get done. [Laughter] I hope it's catching.
I have been a member of the American Legion for a good many years, and my wife, Betty, has been a member of the American Legion Auxiliary for a good many years.
We are both proud of the Legion and the Auxiliary, and what they have done for 29 years in having a Girls State, I think, is a tribute to the patriotic efforts that both of those organizations make.
Now, when you are back home, I hope you can convince your fellow citizens in the 49 States as well as the District of Columbia, that the Government needs your help and their help.
We have a lot of problems, but you can, in my judgment, help us solve some of those problems now and obviously in the future. In a few years, all of you will be down here running the place, so help us get it straightened out now so that it will be a better place for you to get things done in the future.
We are proud of you, we welcome you, and we wish you God's blessing.
