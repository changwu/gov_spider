    Mel Martinez is a good friend and an exceptional public servant. As a refugee from Cuba, Mel came to America in search of freedom and opportunity as one of the many young children sent by their parents as part of a Catholic relief program known as Pedro Pan. As Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, he has worked tirelessly to help every American realize the promise of our country for themselves and their families. I appreciate the energy, optimism, and compassion he brought to my administration. I thank him for serving our Nation so selflessly, and Laura and I wish Mel, his wife, Kitty, and their family well.
