    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior
Subject: Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from Leasing Disposition
Under the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition by leasing through June 30, 2017, the Bristol Bay area of the North Aleutian Basin in Alaska. This withdrawal prevents consideration of Bristol Bay for leasing for any oil or gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf, whether for exploratory or production purposes.
Nothing in this withdrawal affects the rights under existing leases in this area.
