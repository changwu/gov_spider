    The President submitted to the Congress his recommendation to extend the waiver authority granted under the Jackson-Vanik amendment (Section 402) to the 1974 Trade Act. In doing so, the President has determined that extension of the authority and of the waiver for the Soviet Union granted in December 1990 will promote the objectives of the agreement, free emigration.
The President made this decision in view of the fact that the Soviet Government has substantially reduced barriers to emigration for Soviet citizens. Numbers of Soviets emigrating rose from 2,000 in 1986 to over 370,000 in 1990. The administration believes that this positive trend will continue.
The President's action will permit the Soviet Union to remain eligible for export credit guarantee programs of the Commodity Credit Corporation of the Department of Agriculture and of the Export-Import Bank. The waiver is for 1 year.
