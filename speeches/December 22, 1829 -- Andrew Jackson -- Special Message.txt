    To the Senate of the United States:
I herewith transmit two treaties--one concluded with the Winnebago tribe of Indians at Prairie du Chien on the 1st of August, 1829, and the other with the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pottawattamie tribes at the same place on the 29th of July, 1829--which, with the documents explanatory thereof, are submitted to the Senate for consideration whether they will advise and consent to their ratification.
