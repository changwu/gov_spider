    The President has made it clear that he is not interested in another band-aid approach to Social Security and that Social Security must be fixed permanently. Today, by a vote of 100 to 0, the United States Senate agreed with the President and voted in favor of a resolution stating that a permanent solution is needed. The President welcomes this strong commitment from every United States Senator, and hopes that all members will now work together in a constructive and bipartisan way to make it happen this year.
