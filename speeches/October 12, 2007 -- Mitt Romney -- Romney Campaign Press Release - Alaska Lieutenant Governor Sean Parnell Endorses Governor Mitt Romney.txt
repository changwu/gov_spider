Boston, MA â€“ Today, Alaska Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell announced his endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney for President.
"I am supporting Governor Romney because his record shows that he can improve America. He earned trust by taking the helm of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee at a time when it was rocked by scandal, holding everyone involved to a higher standard. Additionally, he earned respect by keeping government spending under control as Governor of Massachusetts. After speaking with Governor Romney, I know he will advocate for allowing the private sector to bring cheaper, cleaner energy to America in the form of natural gas from Alaska. He will create a stronger economy, without losing focus on America's safety in the fight against terrorism," said Lt. Governor Parnell.
Governor Romney added, "I welcome Lieutenant Governor Parnell's support. He understands the importance of a strong economy and the need for fiscal responsibility in Washington. He recognizes that we must restore the highest ethical standards to government. In addition, his dedication to both the community and strong families is admirable and I look forward to working with him."
