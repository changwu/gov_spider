    Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, friends:
In the short span of its independence the Republic of Korea has provided inspiration to those engaged in the common struggle against Communist aggression.
This inspiration springs from the courageous and selfless attitude which the Korean people have displayed both in times of conflict and in times of uneasy peace. They have proved their readiness to die for those principles under which they desire to live. May their example give heart to those of every land who dedicate their lives to the defense and independence of country, and to the strengthening of representative government.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join with me in a toast to His Excellency, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea.
