    Madison, Wis. - Governor Scott Walker today made the following comment on Hillary Clinton's latest attack on him:
"While Hillary Clinton was driving college costs up by charging schools exorbitant speaking fees, I was busy freezing tuition for students. In fact, I froze tuition for four years in a row across the University of Wisconsin system. Instead of delivering hypocritical lectures on college affordability, perhaps Hillary Clinton should look to Wisconsin as an example of how to combat skyrocketing college tuition and student debt."
