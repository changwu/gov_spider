    I have today approved H.R. 3395, an Act making technical corrections to the Federal Employees' Retirement System. The Act contains a number of significant technical and clarifying changes and improvements in the Federal Employees' Retirement System, as well as in the Civil Service Retirement and Foreign Service Retirement systems. While not perfect, these changes will improve the operation of the Government's retirement system for its employees.
Although I have signed H.R. 3395, I want to note my serious objection to a non-germane provision that was added in the Senate immediately before final congressional passage without hearings or the opportunity for the Executive branch or other concerned parties to evaluate and comment on it.
This provision will effectively erect barriers to air carriers that want to provide mail transportation service to rural areas in Alaska, and, in some cases, may well discriminate against existing air carriers. Such restrictions on transporting mail are costly and inefficient and could cause service delays. These restrictions, which undermine market forces and economic efficiency, are contrary to long-standing Federal aviation policy.
Had this provision been presented to me in separate legislation, I would have disapproved it. I therefore strongly urge the Congress to reconsider and repeal this amendment at the earliest opportunity.
