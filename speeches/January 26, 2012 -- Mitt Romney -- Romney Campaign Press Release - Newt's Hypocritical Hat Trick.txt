    GINGRICH ATTACKS FREE ENTERPRISE, HIS OWN INVESTMENTS, AND LOGIC
"Speaker Gingrich has become so unhinged that he is now attacking Governor Romney for investments that he himself has made — the same kind of investments that millions of Americans have in their retirement plans. This is part of the free enterprise system he now attacks. Speaker Gingrich will apparently say anything to change the subject from his million-dollar contract with Freddie Mac's lobbying shop, no matter how ridiculous it sounds." —Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
