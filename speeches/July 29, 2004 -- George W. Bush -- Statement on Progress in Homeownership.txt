    My administration has put forward an aggressive agenda to help all Americans—especially first-time homeowners, low-income families, and minorities—achieve the dream of owning their own home. Today's home-ownership statistics show that we are making significant progress in building an ownership society in America. We have set a new record for homeownership, and today, more Americans, including minorities, own their own home than ever before. We will continue to usher in a new era of ownership by providing additional opportunities for all Americans to realize the American Dream.
