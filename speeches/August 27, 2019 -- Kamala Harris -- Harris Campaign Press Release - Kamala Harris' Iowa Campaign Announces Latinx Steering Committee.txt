    Today, Kamala Harris' campaign in Iowa announced its Latinx Steering Committee. The Committee is made up of Latinx leaders across the state who believe that Kamala Harris is the best person to take on Donald Trump and fight for Latinx Iowans and their families. They will work together with Kamala Harris' organizing team to amplify the campaign's efforts to engage the growing Latinx population in Iowa. The committee will be chaired by Jazmin Newton-Butt who serves as the Iowa LULAC Deputy State Director, Davenport area LULAC Council 10 President, and Iowa ACLU Board Member.
The Committee will use their own networks and organizing power to help the campaign engage in innovative ways with the community. They will also help the campaign lead caucus education efforts for members of the Latinx community who may be first-time caucusgoers.
Members of the Latinx Steering Committee include:

Jazmin Newton-Butt, Iowa LULAC Deputy State Director, Davenport area LULAC Council 10 President, and Iowa ACLU Board Member
Brena Corona, Former Latina Leadership Initiative Board Member from West Des Moines
Kyrstin Delagardelle, Vice Chair, Des Moines School Board
Rosa Garduno, Vice Chair, Asian & Latino Coalition
Mitch Henry, Communications Director, Asian & Latino Coalition from Des Moines
Luis Navar, Latinx Business Owner from Denison
Diana Olivas, Community Activist from Des Moines
Mark Rocha, Board Member, Asian & Latino Coalition from Des Moines

Harris has made engaging communities of color a key priority for her campaign. In Iowa, she participated in a roundtable discussion with women of color in Davenport, has launched the first-of-its-kind Spanish language "Camp Kamala" organizing program, and received the endorsement of the Asian and Latino Coalition. Earlier this month, Harris traveled to Storm Lake, IA and discussed the impact President Trump's offensive rhetoric, ICE raids, and deportations have had on immigrant communities across the state.
