    In the Republican camp, we see Ohio Gov. John Kasich as the most qualified candidate. He is experienced, capable and has shown, especially in the last few weeks, that campaigns are made in town halls, not on debate stages.
Kasich is a seasoned politician and has steered clear of the Trump machinations that have caused other candidates to lose their cool. He knows that's not how he's going to win voters, especially not the ones in New Hampshire.
When every other candidate was in Iowa, he was here. He has visited the state more than any other Republican candidate. He packs up his running debt clock and his blue fleece jacket and goes from town hall to town hall, talking to people. He doesn't bloviate or orchestrate; he talks, and he listens. And his throwback style certainly plays well here â€” seven out of the state's eight biggest newspapers have endorsed him.

The Ledger-Transcript's endorsement is Kasich's eighth New Hampshire newspaper endorsement, including the Keene Sentinel, Concord Monitor, NashuaTelegraph, Valley News, Portsmouth Herald, Foster's Daily Democrat and Bow Times.
