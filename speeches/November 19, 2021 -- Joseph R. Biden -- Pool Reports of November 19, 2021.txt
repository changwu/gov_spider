At least one of the turkeys gobbled with gratitude.

POTUS arrived back at the White House at 2:21, with the M1 landing blowing all of the fallen leaves into the direction of the press. He stepped off M1 at 2:23pm.

"I will sign it. Period."
On whether he will be pardoning people as well as turkeys:
"You need a pardon?" *laughs, something inaudible about turkeys*
That's all from me, thanks all.
