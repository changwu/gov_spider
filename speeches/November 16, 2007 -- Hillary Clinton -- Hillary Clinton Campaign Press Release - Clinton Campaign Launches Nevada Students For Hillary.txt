    More Than 90 College and High School Students
The Clinton campaign today announced that more than 90 college and high school students throughout the Silver State have launched Nevada Students for Hillary. Members of Nevada Students for Hillary are speaking to friends, classmates and neighbors, knocking on doors and volunteering at campaign offices across Nevada in an effort to mobilize caucus goers for Hillary.
"Hillary's campaign in Nevada has been energized by the support of young people excited to be a part of history," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "Both younger students helping out on the ground and those getting ready to cast their first votes know how important this election will be to their future. We're proud to have such a strong and growing network of Nevada students at work for Hillary."
Hillary Clinton is committed to helping young Americans realize their full potential through college affordability programs, improving access to higher education and creating new jobs.
