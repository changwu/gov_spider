    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement today regarding the U.S. Senate's rejection of the amendment put forth by Senator Vitter to the immigration legislation currently before Congress:
"I commend Senator Vitter for his proposed amendment which echoed my call at the debate for making it mandatory that we identify every non-citizen who enters and exits this country.
"There is no guarantee in the current legislation that this will happen which is a fatal flaw. We need to be able to determine who is in this country which is why it is so important to have a uniform, tamper-proof, biometric identification card, a national database, and the US-VISIT system fully functional so we can track who is coming in and out of the country.
"It is unfortunate the Senate defeated the amendment by one vote last night. I encourage the Senate to reconsider their action."
