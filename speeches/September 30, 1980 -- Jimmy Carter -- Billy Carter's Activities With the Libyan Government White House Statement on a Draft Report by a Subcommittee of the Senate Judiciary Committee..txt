    On September 24, 1980, the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary requested by September 29 information relating to the President's knowledge as to certain issues the subcommittee believed to be unresolved in the record of the Billy Carter hearings. The President's Counsel submitted this information to the subcommittee on September 29 as requested.
Unfortunately, before this information could be reviewed and reflected in the subcommittee's report, a draft report previously prepared by the subcommittee's staff has been leaked and reported in the press. The White House has not seen a copy of this draft report and is not in a position to comment on it. We would expect that the final report will reflect the information provided to the subcommittee on September 29 at its request. Because the draft report has already been leaked, we have informed the subcommittee we are now releasing the information it requested.
The news articles which we have seen describing the draft report indicate that the subcommittee staff has found no significant impropriety but has raised certain issues involving questions of judgment. As is to be expected, after-the-fact opinions may differ on judgmental issues.
We look forward to a final report which will present in an impartial and balanced manner the facts learned by the subcommittee and the conclusions it has reached.
