    McLean, VA -Thompson for President Communications Director Todd Harris today released the following statement on reports of push polling phone calls being made in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina:
"There is no room for this kind of smut in a Republican primary election. While there are certainly issues our campaigns disagree on, we are united by far more than that which divides us. One of our candidates is going to emerge from this process as the standard bearer for all Republicans, and we will need a united party to win next year. This kind of robo-dial bigotry which tears down Republicans today will only serve to prop up Democrats tomorrow. It has to end and end now."
