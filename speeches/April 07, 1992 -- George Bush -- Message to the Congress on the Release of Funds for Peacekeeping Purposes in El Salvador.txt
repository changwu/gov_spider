    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 531 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101 - 513), provides that amounts in the Demobilization and Transition Fund established for peacekeeping purposes by that Act shall be made available for obligation and expenditure only upon notification by the President to the Congress that the Government of El Salvador and representatives of the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front (FMLN) have reached a permanent settlement of the conflict, including a final agreement on a cease-fire. On January 16, 1992, the Government of El Salvador and the FMLN signed such an agreement, bringing an end to the civil conflict.
Consistent with section 531, I hereby provide notification that the Government of El Salvador and representatives of the FMLN have reached a permanent settlement of the conflict, including a final agreement on a cease-fire.
This notification allows the amounts in the Demobilization and Transition Fund (Fund) to be made available for obligation and expenditure. The Secretary of State will have responsibility for administering the Fund.
It is extremely important for the United States to support the implementation of this historic peace agreement, and I look forward to your continued cooperation toward achieving our mutual objectives in this endeavor.
George Bush
The White House,
