    Mclean, VA - Today the Fred Thompson campaign announced the endorsement of Bill Salier, a staunch pro-life, small government conservative who made an impressive showing as candidate for U.S. Senate in 2002. Salier recently served as Iowa State Chairman of Congressman Tom Tancredo's Presidential Campaign.
"I am honored to endorse Senator Fred Thompson for President," said Bill Salier. "Senator Thompson has been a consistently strong advocate in securing our borders and enforcing the rule of law. He has the leadership and experience we need guiding this nation and serving the people of Iowa."
A former Marine who completed his tour of duty in Somalia, Bill Salier took the Iowa political scene by surprise when the then-unknown family farmer and former Marine ran a true grassroots campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2002. Salier garnered 42 percent of the vote in the Republican primary against then-Congressman Greg Ganske. Most recently, Bill served as the Iowa State Chairman of Tom Tancredo's Presidential Campaign. A graduate of Iowa State University, Bill and his wife Karla operate the family farm near Nora Springs, Iowa.
"I am very pleased to have the support of Bill Salier," said Senator Thompson. "A native Iowan and veteran of the Marine Corps, Bill is a true conservative leader in Iowa who understands the increasing challenges facing this nation. We share the same conservative principles and I look forward to working with him as we spread our message of consistent conservatism to the great people of Iowa."
