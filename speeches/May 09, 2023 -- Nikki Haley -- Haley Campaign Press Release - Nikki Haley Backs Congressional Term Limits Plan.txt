Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley endorsed a congressional term limit plan.
Under the plan, politicians would be limited to three House terms and two Senate terms. She is the first 2024 candidate to sign a pledge to back the plan and support a constitutional amendment for it, according to U.S. Term Limits, a group that advocates that policy.
"Our Founding Fathers did not want people to make careers out of government. Yet our current D.C. politicians have made a lucrative career of long-term service with some members of Congress serving most of their life in Congress. The result of this dysfunction speaks for itself," Haley said in a statement.
Many conservatives have come out in favor of term limits, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who introduced a U.S. Term Limits-backed constitutional amendment in the Senate. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has also committed to holding a vote on it in the House, per the group.
"We are pleased that Ambassador Haley has signed the U.S. Term Limits presidential pledge," Philip Blumel, the president of U.S. Term Limits, said in a statement. "These advocates have rejected the career politician model and want to replace it with citizen leadership. The way to achieve this goal is through congressional term limits."
In order to go into effect, the proposal would need to attain a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress and get ratified by at least 38 states.
Haley previously garnered attention after she pitched mental competency tests for politicians older than 75. In backing her proposal, she took direct aim at President Joe Biden, 80, and has raised doubts about his ability to finish a second term in office.
