    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Review of the Federal Statistical System
I have directed my Reorganization Project staff to perform a comprehensive review of the organization of the system that collects, evaluates and disseminates statistical data for the Federal government.
This Nation has the most accurate and efficient statistical system in the world. But a number of persistent problems-including the burden placed upon respondents and the responsiveness of data to policy needs—indicate a pressing need to improve the coordination of Federal statistical activities, which are growing at an increasing rate.
The study will use to the maximum extent the work that has been done in previous efforts. During the course of the study the project staff will be seeking the advice and support—including staff assistance and other resources—of many of the agencies that are part of our statistical system. I trust you will cooperate to the fullest extent possible. In addition to Federal agencies, the project will need the advice and counsel of the Congress, State and local governments and the public.
To ensure that all affected parties are informed, I have directed that this memorandum be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
