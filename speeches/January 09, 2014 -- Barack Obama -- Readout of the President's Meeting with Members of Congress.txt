    Today President Obama met with Members of Congress to discuss the Administration's ongoing review of signals intelligence programs, including our study of the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies report. In August, the President committed his Administration to working with Congress to pursue reforms to our nation's surveillance programs and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
