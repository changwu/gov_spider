    Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
Subject: Food Security Wheat Reserve Release
By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 (the "Act") (7 U.S.C. 1736f - 1), I hereby authorize the release in fiscal year 1991 of up to 300,000 metric tons of wheat from the reserve established under the Act (the "reserve") for use under Title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.), to meet relief needs that exist in developing countries of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, which I hereby determine are suffering major disasters. The wheat will be used to provide urgent humanitarian relief to the peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia who are suffering widespread hunger and malnutrition.
This action is taken because wheat needed for relief in these regions cannot be programmed for such purpose in a timely manner under the normal means of obtaining commodities for food assistance due to circumstances of unanticipated and exceptional need.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
George Bush
