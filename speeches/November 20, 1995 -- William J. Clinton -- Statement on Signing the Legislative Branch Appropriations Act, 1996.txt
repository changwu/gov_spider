    Last night I signed into law H.R. 2492, the "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1996."
The Act provides fiscal year 1996 appropriations for the Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, the Architect of the Capitol, the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress.
On October 3, 1995, I vetoed the first Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, indicating at the time that the bill was acceptable but that the Congress should not take care of its own business before it takes care of the people's business. At the time the Legislative Branch bill was sent to the White House, the Congress had passed only one other of the 13 appropriations bills. The Congress has now completed action on six bills that I have been able to sign.
While much work remains to be done and the Congress remains behind schedule, I signed this bill recognizing that the Congress has indeed made some progress since October 3.
I urge the Congress to meet its responsibilities by sending me the remaining FY 1996 appropriations bills in an acceptable form.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, November 20, 1995.
