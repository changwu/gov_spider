In the 19th century, a generation of Americans did exactly that. They faced challenges similar to ours: the steam engine made the world smaller; the telegraph opened a new age of communication; new machines created new industries and upended a centuries-old economic status quo.
Time has brought us to the doorstep of the future. But whether we turn the knob and push, whether we step across the threshold of the new age, whether we embrace this century with its challenges and its opportunities, its adventures and its dangers, is a decision that is ours alone to make. I say we have lingered long enough on the future's edge. I invite you to step forward with me, together.
