    As the world recognizes the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I am deeply concerned by the continued magnitude of this problem. Approximately one in three women across the globe is physically or sexually abused during her lifetime; many at the hands of an intimate partner. Too many women and girls are victimized by practices like human trafficking or forced marriage. Violence against women creates and maintains poverty. It threatens peace. Perhaps, most importantly, it degrades all of humanity. We all must work together to fight gender-based violence around the world, and the abuse of power in all of its forms. Today we join with the international community in renewing this commitment.
