Today, Idaho State Representative Robert Anderst endorsed John Kasich for President of the United States. In September, State Senator Marv Hagedorn endorsed John Kasich for President.
"It is time to place trust in trustworthy individuals. Gov. Kasich has not just talked about balancing the budget he has done it," Rep. Anderst said. "He has not just talked about economic growth he has fostered it. He has not just talked about the importance of a strong military, he has fought for it. He has not just talked about welfare reform he has passed it. He has not just talked about the importance of faith in our society he has been an example of it. In this Presidential election we will choose between talk or action. I choose action. This election is about who we trust to do what he or she says they will do as President and I trust Gov. Kasich because of what he has done."
Robert Anderst is an Idaho businessman with strong common sense conservative beliefs. He has served in the Idaho House of Representatives for the 12th legislative District A since 2012. He is a 4th generation Idahoan who lives in Canyon County. Anderst is a small business owner and has worked in the real-estate industry for almost 20 years.
"Robert understands the importance of balancing budgets and bringing common-sense to government. I'm excited to have him on our team," Governor Kasich said.
