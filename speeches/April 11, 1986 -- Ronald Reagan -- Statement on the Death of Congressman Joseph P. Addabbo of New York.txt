    The Nation's Capital is saddened today over the death of Joseph Addabbo, a congressional leader who aggressively fought for his ideals for more than 25 years in the House of Representatives.
Congressman Addabbo was a strong voice for policies which he believed would make this a more peaceful world. He rose to prominence in the early 1970's and, by the end of that decade, was recognized as one of the leading players in the development of American military policy. As chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, his strong convictions and unrelenting opposition to what he considered ineffective defense spending made him a powerful force on Capitol Hill. Congressman Addabbo was widely respected for his knowledge of defense issues even by those who disagreed with him. His genial style was in keeping with the best traditions of American politics. He will be missed by those he represented in New York's Sixth District and by all who worked with him.
