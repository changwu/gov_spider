    Harris chose the radical left over the interests of American workers.
As a senator, Kamala Harris has failed to put American workers first. As vice president, she would return to the failed status quo trade deals that hurt American workers.
Harris was one of just 10 senators to vote against terminating NAFTA and replacing it with the job-creating United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). NAFTA was a failed trade deal supported by Joe Biden that killed American jobs. With her vote, Harris prioritized the radical anti-Trump left over the interests of American workers.


Even Biden admitted that President Trump's USMCA is "better than NAFTA."

President Trump's USMCA is expected to create 176,000 new jobs and grow America's economy by up to $235 billion.

The USMCA will boost manufacturers in every state, and the International Trade Commission predicted American manufacturing would experience "the largest percentage gains" in higher wages, new jobs, and greater exports out of any industry thanks to the USMCA.

President Trump is standing up to China's unfair trade practices. He successfully used tariffs to persuade China to sign a Phase One Trade Agreement that secured significant protections for American workers and businesses.
