    "President Obama has left Americans worse off than when he took office, with chronic unemployment and declining incomes. But it's not just this generation that's paying the price – the next generation has been saddled with enormous debt because of President Obama's policies. As president, Mitt Romney will take immediate action to cut spending and stop passing our bills on to our children."  – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

FLASHBACK:Candidate Obama Claimed It Was "Unpatriotic" And "Irresponsible" To Add $4 Trillion To The National Debt. OBAMA: "The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents - #43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back -- $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks, Fargo, ND, 7/3/08)

(President Barack Obama, Remarks, Washington, D.C., 2/23/09)
