    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the text of the amendment to Article 61 of the Charter of the United Nations adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 20, 1971, and set forth in General Assembly Resolution 2847 (XXVI).
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report received by me from the Department of State with respect to the amendment.
Article 61 of the Charter relates to the composition of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and the election to membership thereon by the General Assembly. At present the Council is composed of 27 members as a result of a Charter amendment adopted in 1963, which entered into force on August 31, 1965. By the new amendment to Article 61, the Council membership would be increased from 27 to 54. A formula for geographic distribution of the seats on the Council is also set forth in the General Assembly's Resolution.
As in 1963, when the Council membership was enlarged from 18 to 27, the Economic and Social Council must be enlarged to take account of the growth of the United Nations Organization, with particular attention to the need for an equitable distribution of membership among the less developed countries.
It is in the national interest of the United States to ratify the new amendment to Article 61 with a view to making more effective the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.
I therefore request the consent of the Senate to ratification by the United States of the amendment set forth in Resolution 2847 (XXVI).
