    MRS. FORD and I join with the people of New York State and with all Americans who cherish a free and vigorous press in mourning the passing of Franklin Rockefeller Little.
As the owner, editor, and publisher of a number of newspapers in New York, Franklin Little distinguished himself as a man who was devoted to the truth and to informing his many readers of the truth and the meaning of events-great and small. His expert and incisive commentary on the major issues of his time was his trademark. He left his imprint as well on a host of endeavors for the public good.
For more than half a century, newspapering was his work, and it is now his proud legacy to those who will follow him. An outstanding public servant, a man who never lost the reporter's instinct for news, Franklin Little has left a great void in his own profession and in the State and Nation he served with such distinction.
