    MEMORANDUM FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND MILITARY PERSONNEL:
Those of us who work for the Federal Government have a special responsibility to demonstrate our generosity and compassion toward fellow citizens and concern for our communities.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign, we have an opportunity to meet these commitments in a positive, productive way by supporting the services of voluntary health and welfare agencies, including the United Way, the American Red Cross, national health agencies, and international service agencies--organizations concerned with the welfare of human beings.
In supporting the Combined Federal Campaign, we are participating voluntarily as citizens in a uniquely American project, helping our neighbors-especially the aged, the infirm, the handicapped, the ill, and families in distress-through these voluntary charitable organizations.
By bringing the helping hand of voluntary organizations to those in need, whether at home or abroad, we strengthen what is best in our Nation and realize what is best in ourselves as a people. The amount you give must be a personal and voluntary decision. But I ask each of you to join with me in supporting this most worthy effort to the fullest possible extent.
