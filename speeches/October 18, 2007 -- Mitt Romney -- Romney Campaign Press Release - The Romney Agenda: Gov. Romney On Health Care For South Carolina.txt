STRATEGY FOR A STRONGER AMERICA:
GOV. ROMNEY ON HEALTH CARE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA
Governor Romney's Plan To Improve America And South Carolina's Health Care System:
Today, In South Carolina, Governor Romney Addressed His Conservative Blueprint To Make Health Care More Affordable And Accessible. Governor Romney has outlined a comprehensive solution to America's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all, government-run system, Governor Romney's plan recognizes the importance of the role of the states and South Carolina in leading reform and the need for innovation in dealing with rising health care costs and the problem of the uninsured.
- In South Carolina, 16 Percent Of The Population Is Uninsured. More than 660,000 people are uninsured. For those with insurance, the average annual individual health insurance premium is $3,328. In 2004 alone, $21.45 billion was spent on health care in South Carolina.
- Governor Romney's Plan Facilitates The Growth Of The Private Health Insurance Market. Governor Romney believes that by expanding and deregulating the private health insurance market, we can decrease costs and ensure that more South Carolinians have access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance.

Linking Goals With Action Steps: The Federalist Approach
Governor Romney's Approach To Health Care Reform Is One That Values South Carolina And The States As Laboratories Of Innovation And Beacons Of Creativity. As Governor of Massachusetts, Governor Romney successfully led the effort for comprehensive health care reform, and he recognizes that the federal government must do what it can to facilitate effective change at the state level. His reforms will give South Carolina the flexibility to design its own health care reform plan. But Governor Romney's conservative reforms also make the states true partners in the effort to expand access to affordable, quality health insurance.
Governor Romney's Conservative Blueprint: Six Action Steps
Governor Romney Proposed Six Concrete Steps To Reach His Health Care Reform Goals:
- Step 1: Establish Federal Incentives To Deregulate And Reform State Health Insurance Markets So Market Forces Can Work. Many South Carolinians can't afford private health insurance because state markets are over-regulated and in serious need of reform. In South Carolina, there are 19 mandates on the health insurance market. Governor Romney will provide federal incentives for states to deregulate and reform their health insurance markets. This will bring down the cost of health insurance and facilitate greater consumer choice, while giving states like South Carolina the power to institute the reforms that suit them best.
- Step 2: Redirect Federal Spending On "Free Care" To Help The Low-Income Uninsured Purchase Private Insurance. Currently, taxpayers subsidize "free care" for millions who are uninsured but receive treatment when they need it. Governor Romney will end subsidized care for "free riders" by redirecting these existing federal and state resources to help the low-income uninsured purchase their own private health insurance. States like South Carolina are free to craft their own programs and institute their own eligibility requirements. Most importantly, this can be done without the need for new spending or taxes.
- Step 3: Institute Health Savings Account (HSA) Enhancements And The Full Deductibility Of Qualified Medical Expenses. The tax code currently discriminates against those who do not buy their health insurance through an employer and creates incentives for the over-consumption of health care services. Governor Romney will make private insurance more affordable for every South Carolinian by reforming the tax code. He will expand and grow HSAs. He also supports the full deductibility of qualified medical expenses, which will allow people in South Carolina to deduct the cost of their health insurance and out-of-pocket medical expenses, where accompanied by at least catastrophic insurance.
- Step 4: Promote Innovation In Medicaid. States have very little flexibility under current law to enact innovative changes to Medicaid that will help more citizens while containing costs. In South Carolina, more than 617,000 people receive Medicaid benefits and the average annual Medicaid payment per enrollee is $2,974. Governor Romney will block-grant federal funds to states and remove the burdensome administrative requirements that prevent South Carolina and other states from improving the program.
- Step 5: Implement Medical Liability Reform. Too many doctors are practicing defensive medicine because of frivolous lawsuits and an out-of-control medical liability system. Governor Romney will implement medical liability reform, including federal caps on non-economic and punitive damage awards in medical malpractice cases. He will also encourage states to engage in additional medical liability reforms that will both honor the rights of patients and respect the work of physicians. South Carolina has been a leader in reforming the tort system and Governor Romney will call on every state to follow their lead.
- Step 6: Bring Market Dynamics And Modern Technology To Health Care. Consumers in South Carolina are not empowered in the current system to make intelligent decisions about the purchase of health care and many aspects of the health care system remain technologically backwards. Governor Romney will bring health care into the 21st century by enhancing the use of information technology, establishing cost and quality transparency, encouraging more HSAs and co-insurance products, and calling for more provider options.
