  A Proclamation

Extracurricular activities in the high schools of this country provide our students with valuable opportunities to discover and develop talents in areas other than those covered within the classroom. Extracurricular activities also build school spirit and demonstrate the importance of promoting common goals.
Through such programs as student government, athletics, music, drama, debate, journalism, community service, and many others, students gain key insights into the roles which competition and cooperation play in our society. Moreover, these experiences help students to learn to set and achieve goals, to organize their time effectively, and to enhance the social skills that are needed to enjoy and succeed in life.
In recognition of the significant place extracurricular opportunities have in the growth of our high school students, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 101, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the week of October 17 through October 23, 1983 as National High School Activities Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 17, 1983 as National High School Activities Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this period with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
