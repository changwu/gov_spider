    Hillary Clinton released the following statement about President Obama's newly announced Clean Power Plan:
"The Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan is a significant step forward in meeting the urgent threat of climate change. It sets a smart federal standard that gives states the flexibility to choose how to reduce carbon pollution most effectively. And it drives investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, reduces asthma attacks and premature deaths, and promotes a healthier environment and a stronger economy. It's a good plan, and as President, I'd defend it.
"It will need defending. Because Republican doubters and defeatists – including every Republican candidate for president – won't offer any credible solution. The truth is, they don't want one. They just keep making the same tired arguments they've been making for years. They refuse to accept science. They refuse to believe in American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, even though we've seen time and time again that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.
"Of course, the Clean Power Plan standards set the floor, not the ceiling. We can and must go further. As President, I will launch a Clean Energy Challenge to give states, cities and rural communities that are ready to lead the tools and resources to succeed. By combining the Clean Power Plan with my Clean Energy Challenge, we'll achieve two big goals:

We will have half of a billion installed solar panels by the end of my first term in office,
We will generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years of my taking office.

As President, I will build on the work of this Administration and make America a clean energy superpower and a global leader in the fight against climate change. That's a promise."
