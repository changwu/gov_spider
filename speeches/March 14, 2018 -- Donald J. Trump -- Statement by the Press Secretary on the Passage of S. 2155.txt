    President Donald J. Trump commends the Senate, led by Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) for passing S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The President supports this bill, and as recently noted in a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP), he would sign it into law.
The bill provides much-needed relief from the Dodd-Frank Act for thousands of community banks and credit unions and will spur lending and economic growth without creating risks to the financial system. By tailoring regulation, the bill seeks to prevent excessive regulation from undermining the viability of local and regional banks and their ability to serve their communities.
The President looks forward to discussing any further revisions the House is interested in making, with the goal of bipartisan, pro-growth Dodd-Frank relief reaching his desk as soon as possible.
