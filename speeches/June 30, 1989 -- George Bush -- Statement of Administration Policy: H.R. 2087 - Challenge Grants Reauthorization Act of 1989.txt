    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Owens (D) NY)
The Administration is opposed to the enactment of H.R. 2087. The challenge grant program extended by this bill to help States start trust funds devoted to child abuse prevention is no longer necessary. By the end of 1990, almost all States will have trust funds or other funding mechanisms for child abuse prevention activities. Also, the Administration supports child abuse prevention activities under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act; moreover, such activities can be assisted under the Social Services Block Grant.
