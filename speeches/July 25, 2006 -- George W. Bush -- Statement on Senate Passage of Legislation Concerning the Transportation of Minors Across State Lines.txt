    Transporting minors across State lines to bypass parental consent laws regarding abortion undermines State law and jeopardizes the lives of young women. To combat this dangerous practice, the Senate today passed the "Child Custody Protection Act," which penalizes those who unlawfully attempt to circumvent parental notification requirements.
I appreciate the Senate's efforts to preserve the integrity of State law and protect our Nation's families. I look forward to the House and Senate resolving their differences in conference and sending this legislation for my signature.
