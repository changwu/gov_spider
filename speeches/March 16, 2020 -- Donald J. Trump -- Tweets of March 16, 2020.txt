I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That's what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!Retweets: 39829Favorites: 186301

Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!Retweets: 25405Favorites: 120293
