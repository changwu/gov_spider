    The United States congratulates Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli on his election as Prime Minister earlier this month and to Bidhya Devi Bhandari on her historic election as Nepal's first female President today. These elections follow the promulgation of a constitution and the formation of a new government, milestones in Nepal's democratic development that demonstrate the people of Nepal's commitment to democracy. The United States looks forward to continuing to partner with the people and government of Nepal as they build a more unified, stable, and prosperous country and rebuild after the devastating earthquake and its aftershocks earlier this year.
