    HONOLULU, Hawaii — U.S. Congresswoman and Army Major Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) leaves the campaign trail today for two weeks of active duty training to fulfill her National Guard obligation. She will resume her campaign activities on August 25th. 
Rep. Gabbard has served as a soldier in the Army National Guard for more than 16 years, and deployed twice to the Middle East — in Iraq from 2004-2006 in a field medical unit and in Kuwait from 2008-2009 where she led her platoon in conducting security operations and training of the Kuwait Army's counter-terrorism team. She is in her fourth term and seventh year in Congress, where she has served as a member of the House Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Homeland Security Committees.
"I love our country. I am grateful to be able to serve our country and the American people in many ways, including as a soldier," Gabbard said. "And so, while some people are telling me, ‘Gosh, this is a terrible time to leave the campaign. Can't you find a way out of it?' That's not what this is about. I look forward to joining my fellow soldiers for a joint-training exercise with the Indonesian military, focused on counterterrorism and disaster response."
Rep. Gabbard has previously participated in joint military training exercises in countries such as Indonesia and Japan.  
NOTE TO MEDIA: While Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard steps away from all campaign-related activities while she is on military orders, her campaign team will remain active on her behalf and campaign surrogates will be available for media interviews while she is gone.
Congresswoman Gabbard rejoins the campaign trail on August 25.
