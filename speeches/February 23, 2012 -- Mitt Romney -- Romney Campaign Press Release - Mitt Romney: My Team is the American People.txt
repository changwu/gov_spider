I wonder which team he was taking it for. My team is the American people, not the insiders in Washington, and I'll fight for the people of America, not special interests." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Now, I hope you watched the debate last night. It was kind of fun. I enjoyed it. It was kind of an interesting night. I didn't expect what happened. What happened was we saw, in this case, Senator Santorum, explain most of the night why he did or voted for things he disagreed with and he talked about this as taking one for the team. I wonder which team he was taking it for. My team is the American people, not the insiders in Washington, and I'll fight for the people of America, not special interests. He explained, for instance, why it was he voted against the repeal of right to work laws. Again, saying that was against his principle but he did it for the team. He explained why he voted to protect Davis-Bacon. He explained why he voted to raise the debt ceiling five times without compensating cuts in federal spending. He explained why it was that he voted to fund Planned Parenthood even thought that was against his principles. He explained why he voted for No Child Left Behind, even though that was against his principles. He explained why he voted for the Bridge to Nowhere even though that was against his principles. I don't know that I've ever seen a politician explain in so many ways why it was he voted against his principles. I can tell you one thing: if I'm President of the United States, I will abide by my principles, and my team will be the people of the United States of America."
