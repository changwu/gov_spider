    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas.
"I'm proud to earn Asa's endorsement," said Mitt Romney. "Asa is a law and order conservative and a tireless advocate for pro-growth economic policies, empowering small businesses, and strengthening the middle class. His support will be integral as I bring this message across the country in the months to come."
Announcing his support, Asa Hutchinson said, "President Obama's policies have been an abject failure both at home and abroad. We need a nominee who can not only defeat President Obama, but also put in place conservative policies that will make us more prosperous at home and respected abroad. Mitt Romney is a proven leader who has the experience to get our country back on track. I am proud to stand with him and I call on all conservatives who believe that America's best days are ahead of us to join me."
