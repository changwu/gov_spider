    Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today made the following statement on President Obama's devastating cuts to defense spending:
"As a former Secretary of Defense, I am deeply concerned about the damage a sequester will do to our national security. We can no longer maintain our status as a world power if we try to deal with the deficit by dramatic cuts to the military, as the Obama Administration seems to be inclined to do. I solidly endorse Governor Romney's position that we need to maintain a strong national defense."
