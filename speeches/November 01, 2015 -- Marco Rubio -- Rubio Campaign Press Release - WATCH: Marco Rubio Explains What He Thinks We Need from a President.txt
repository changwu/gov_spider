On President Obama's recent decision to send 50 military advisers to Syria:

It's an important start from a tactical perspective, but I think the broader issue is, what is the strategy? And I think the strategy has to involve more coordination with the Kurds and also with Sunnis. We're not going to defeat ISIS, a radical Sunni movement, without a robust anti-ISIS Sunni coalition. So I do think it's an important tactical step forward, but it needs to be backed up with increased air strikes and so forth. So I don't have a problem with the tactics of it — the numbers might even have to be larger at some point — but the bigger issue is, can they arrive at a strategy? And that's what I think the administration is still struggling with.
On what he sees as the duty of the President:

The job of a President is to craft a vision for America's future — to put the right people in the right positions and hold them accountable for carrying out your agenda, but also to rally the people behind big causes. Entitlement reform is a huge undertaking; it'll never happen without presidential leadership. Not to mention national security — the role of commander-in-chief is the most important job of a president. In the context of Barack Obama, he has now been president for seven years, he has significant executive experience, and he's still making mistakes, in my opinion.
