    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
On October 19, 1977, I announced a program designed to motivate Federal personnel at all levels to help improve the quality and performance of Government. I asked to be advised of exceptional contributions by both civilian and military personnel so that I might send a personal letter of appreciation to each.
After one full year of operation of this special recognition program, total tangible benefits to the Government have exceeded $210 million. Some 1,380 people, representing 29 departments and agencies, contributed to changes which saved the public an amount equal to the average income taxes of 95,000 Americans. Equally important, there were benefits to the Government and the nation to which no dollar figure can be readily attachedâ€”improvements in vital services, scientific achievements, and contributions to the health and well-being of the American people. Particularly outstanding results have been achieved by personnel of the Departments of the Air Force, Navy, and Health, Education, and Welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
These results are gratifying. They prove that given proper motivation and incentive, Federal personnel are eager to contribute to the growth of productivity in Government. It is up to management to use this great resource and to harness the energy, creativity, and ingenuity of those who work in our Government.
I ask all of you, therefore, to provide personal leadership during the year ahead in making full and effective use of the incentive awards authorities to improve Government productivity. And I ask you to continue to emphasize to everyone in your organizations the need for participation in, and support of, this most important effort.
