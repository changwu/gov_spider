    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Ohio Congressman Steve LaTourette.
"I'm humbled to have the support of Congressmen LaTourette," said Mitt Romney. "As he can attest, Ohio has been hit hard by President Obama's failed economic policies. His support will be crucial as we take our message to Ohio and the nation in the months to come."
"In this election, the stakes could not be higher and the choice could not be clearer," said Congressman Steve LaTourette. "The American people can choose a president whose reckless spending has made our economy worse, or a businessman with vision, integrity, and a proven track record of turning around troubled enterprises. Mitt Romney is the only candidate that can defeat President Obama and create jobs for Ohioans. I look forward to joining with him to get America back on track."
