    On behalf of the American people, I send my congratulations and best wishes to all those who are observing Serbian National Day. The United States and Serbia are strong partners, and here in America, those of Serbian descent enrich our national diversity and identity. I look forward to a continued friendship and strengthened partnership between our two countries.
