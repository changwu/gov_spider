    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Penny (D) MN and Smith (R) NJ)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 2486. This bill would expand and make permanent the current program which authorizes special preference in Federal hiring for certain disadvantaged Vietnam veterans. The Administration, however, supports enactment of the better targeted provisions of section 113 of S. 13, and will to seek to have it enacted.
