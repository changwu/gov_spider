Commercial-Appeal: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visits I-40 bridge work site, work expected to last through July[Samuel Hardiman and Daniel Connolly, 6/3/21]
[…]
[Secretary Buttigieg] noted that the shutdown and associated traffic delays are affecting tens of thousands of people as well as a large number of businesses.
"And even for people outside this region, it is important that we restore this connection quickly because like so much about the Memphis region, it is an area of national logistical importance."
Truck and vehicle traffic has been snarled in and outside of Memphis following the bridge's closure, forcing thousands of cars and trucks to use the older Interstate 55 bridge instead of going across the river using Interstate 40. The Interstate 55 crossing has experienced delays among the heavier traffic.

Buttigieg said this visit helped him realize how crucial the I-40 bridge is.
"Safety is the heart of what's happened at the DeSoto Bridge. Closure has been challenging and costly.

If anything, the transportation secretary has a whole new appreciation for Memphis as America's distribution center.
"We're seeing just how important our connections and infrastructure are and also we're seeing just how vulnerable it is especially when it comes down to a single point of dependency, like the one bridge that's up and running here," he said. "All you've got to do is take one look around that airfield where FedEx is to see just how important that industry is to Memphis, but also how important Memphis is to the world."
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Manassas, Virginia
Inside NoVa: Semiconductor push comes to Manassas[Jared Foretek, 5/27/21]

Raimondo said the shortage is proving how crucial the semiconductor supply chain is to the country, but manufacturing has recently been dominated by Taiwan. According to CNBC, Taiwan's contract manufacturers generated 60% of the worldwide foundry revenue in 2020. And according to the bill's authors, the Communist Party of China is investing $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing to gain more control of the global supply.
"Hospitals and medical equipment rely on semiconductors. Pick up your phone, semiconductors. Do anything on a computer, semiconductors," Raimondo said. "As we go forward – artificial intelligence, quantum computing, everything we do is built on the building blocks of semiconductors. So the supply chain of semiconductors must be secure."
