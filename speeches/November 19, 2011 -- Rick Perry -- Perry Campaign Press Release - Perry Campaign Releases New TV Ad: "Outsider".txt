    AUSTIN – The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "Outsider," which is airing over national cable and Iowa broadcast and cable.

"We need a real outsider to overhaul Washington and cut the taxes, regulation and spending strangling our economy and of the GOP candidates Rick Perry is the only real Washington outsider in the race for the White House," said Perry campaign communications director Ray Sullivan. "Rick Perry is not the darling of the establishment, has never served in Congress and has never professionally lobbied Congress or the White House. Gov. Perry is the only candidate Americans can trust to truly overhaul Washington and jump-start job creation."
