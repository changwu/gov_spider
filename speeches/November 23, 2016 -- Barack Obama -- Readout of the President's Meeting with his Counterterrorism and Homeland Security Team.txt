    This morning the President convened members of his national security team to review our comprehensive domestic and international efforts to protect the American people during this holiday season. The President commended the continued cooperation between federal, state, and local authorities to ensure public safety and directed that all agencies maintain vigilance to ensure we are best postured to defend the homeland and prevent attacks by individuals radicalized to violence. The President was also briefed on recent successful military operations against ISIL and al-Qa'ida that targeted key external operations plotters. He instructed the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community to maintain our relentless pressure on terrorists seeking to harm Americans. Finally, the President expressed his deep appreciation for U.S. personnel deployed around the world and the countless security personnel standing watch at our borders, ports, and facilities across the nation while their fellow Americans come together for the holidays.
