    Nancy Reagan defined grace, courage, and loyalty. An accomplished actress, First Lady of California, and First Lady of the United States, she understood public service is a noble endeavor. She was a strong voice to keep children safe from drugs, and she reached out to give comfort to fellow cancer survivors, communities touched by gun violence, and families as they cared for a loved one on the lonely walk of Alzheimer's. That's who she gave voice to in her service to our country. And together, she and our 40th president gave meaning to a poet's words:
"Come live with me and be my love/And we will all the pleasures prove."
Nancy and Ronald Reagan proved those pleasures for more than half a century. They are now together to prove them once again.
Jill and I offer our deepest condolences to Patti, Ron, Michael, and the entire Reagan family.
