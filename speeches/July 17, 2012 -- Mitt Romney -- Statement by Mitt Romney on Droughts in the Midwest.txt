    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on droughts in the Midwest:
"The agriculture sector has continued to thrive amidst these difficult economic times thanks to the productivity and efficiency of farmers and ranchers. However, the widespread drought that is gripping this country will have a far reaching impact on these Americans and the country as a whole. My thoughts are with farmers and ranchers during this difficult time and as they continue their efforts to ensure that America has the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the world."
