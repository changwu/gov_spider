    All right. Who brought the coffee? Now let's go. Governor Engler's here. You know his reputation as a fiscal conservative. When it comes to the taxpayers' money, they say he's so tight that he squeaks when he walks, so we are going to find out about that. [Laughter]
We're grateful to see so many people ready for the latest "Big Mac Attack." We're going across this thing. Barbara and I were over in Sault Sainte Marie, and she handed me my sneakers. And she said, "Just do it." Well, that's what we plan to do this fall, I'll tell you.
The only other point I want to make is that this is Labor Day, and to those hard workers across this country, don't let anybody tell you we are a nation in decline. We're a nation on the rise. Our workers are the most productive anyplace in the entire world.
So the big question is, how do we get this country moving so everybody that wants a job has one? And the answer is to spend a little less Government money, tax a little bit less, and stimulate the economy and get it going. And we're going to do that.
Thanks for a great welcome. And I just can't tell you how much we're looking forward to this walk. We'll set a good pace. And I plan to set that pace in November. We need you. Many, many thanks for your support.
Now let's go. We're off. Thank you all.
