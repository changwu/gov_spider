  A Proclamation

For blind Americans, the white cane is an important sign of independence, symbolizing their ability to travel in our Nation's cities and towns with great confidence and safety. For motorists, the white cane symbolizes caution, and reminds them that their courtesy and consideration insure the safety of the visually disabled.
We should always be aware of the significance of the white cane and extend every courtesy to those who carry it. By doing so, we will respect and ensure the right to independence of the visually disabled as they pursue a productive and fulfilling life.
In recognition of the significance of the white cane, the Congress, by a joint resolution of October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), authorized the President to proclaim October 15 of each year as White Cane Safety Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1981, as White Cane Safety Day.
I urge all Americans to mark this occasion by giving greater consideration to the special needs of the visually disabled, and, particularly, to observe White Cane Safety Day with activities that contribute to maximum independent use of our streets and public facilities by our visually handicapped population.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 28th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
