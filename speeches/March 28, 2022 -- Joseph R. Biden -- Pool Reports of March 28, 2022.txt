3/28 pool report #6 -- POTUS remarks conclude, questions begin
POTUS completed his prepared statement about his budget at 3:10p. He is now taking questions. All of this is being livestreamed here, but here are a few highlights from ongoing questions.
In response to a question about his remarks on Putin on Saturday, POTUS said:
"I'm not walking anything back. The fact of the matter is I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt... I wasn't then nor am I now expressing a policy change."
"If he continues on this course that he's on, he's going to become a pariah worldwide."
Another reporter asked if he was concerned his remarks would escalate the conflict. POTUS said that he is not.
As always, please check quotes against the WH transcript.

3/28 pool report #7 -- POTUS q+a is over
POTUS left the podium at 3:23 pm.
POTUS said the only thing worse than an intended war is an unintended war, and that "nobody believes I was talking about taking down" Putin.
"The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war, a nuclear war with Russia."
"People like this shouldn't be ruling countries, but they do."
Pressed on whether he would meet with Putin, POTUS said, "it depends on what he wants to talk about."
Again, check quotes against transcript!
