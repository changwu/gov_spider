WH travel pool #12 - fundraiser remarks
Pool was brought into the fundraiser at 7:21 pm. POTUS starting speaking at 7:31 pm and wrapped at 7:59 pm.
Jess Molasky, who opened the fundraiser, thanked his mom Christy for letting them use her home for the fundraiser. Molasky noted today was his birthday and he wanted "to try to do something good for our country. So I'm turning 29. Well, when I think about the future, there's a lot of challenges ahead. That's really why we're here today to talk about the future of our country."
He introduced POTUS, who told him: "I'm only here because it's your birthday."
In his remarks, POTUS acknowledged the difficulties in the country: "Inflation is still a problem but it's down 30% since the summer .... And you know, everything from NATO and Ukraine has been a real push. It's cost a lot of money and it's also it was the right thing to do. I think we didn't have a choice. Never, ever we have 185,000 people invade another country in Europe since World War Two."
He also listed his administration's accomplishments: "We ended up creating 12 million brand new jobs more than any president has created for years." He also talked about passing the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act.
He talked about climate change: "No joke. This is serious stuff. It's a single most dire consequence. If we don't keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius, not go above that, we're going to damn our children to circumstances where we are the only, truly existential threat of nuclear war."
He repeated his line about how it's not your father's Republican Party and said they're "telling me that unless I vote the way they want, I go along with their budget, they're not going to, in fact, pay our debts. We're going to, for the first time in American history, renege on the federal debt."
More: "We've never failed to pay it and the interest is accumulated on it and we continue to pay it. If we've ever going to renege on it, we're going to see a national economic crisis not only here but worldwide."
He talked about prescription drug prices and how his administration has lowered the cost of insulin.
He said MAGA Republicans have tried 50 times to repeal Obamacare.
POTUS: "Extreme Republicans make up to about 40% of the House Republican caucus of the party."
He repeated his story, and how he wouldn't say who the lawmakers are: "The eight senior Republicans who were still in the United States Senate who have come to me over the last 10 months and tell me they agree with me but if they vote me what will happen is they will lose their primay. They will be out of office."
More on Republicans: "They want to cut. They want to cut. They don't want to do anything about Trump's tax cut that was $2 trillion that did not do very much but create a gigantic deficit. More deficit was created under Donald Trump in four years that increased the overall national debt by 22%."
He repeated his story about Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene calling him a "liar" at the State of the Union.
More: "We have a choice in this election unrelated to me but between the Democrats and Republicans and what they stand for and what they're about in terms of what they want to get done."
POTUS on Speaker McCarthy: "I met with the Speaker of the House. He's not a bad guy. He's a decent guy. And he sat with me and said what are we going to do? Said I'll tell you what - I'll my submit my budget in detail on the ninth of March, you submit yours and we'll negotiate."
More: "I haven't even talked about foreign policy time off of it, but bottom line is, these guys are talking about not fund8ing so many pieces of our foreign policy."
He repeated his story about going to the G7 meeting in England and how he said America is back. He said: "Macron looked at me and said for how long?" He added the German chancellor said to him: "For how long can you keep what you're doing?"
He noted he was watching TV on AF1 on the flight to Vegas: "And now you're turning on the television today and I got here on Air Force One. I'm watching and you got Western Oregon deciding they're going to secede and become part of Idaho. What in the hell is going on? (Laughter) Idaho's a beautiful state but no I'm serious. They've actually moved hard. They've passed resolutions in the state to do that."'
Note from pool: The Oregon story played on CNN, which was on in the press cabin during the flight, and it is Eastern Oregon that voted to secede.
At 8:11 pm motorcade was rolling to the RON.
