    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed at Ljubljana on June 21, 1999. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention.
This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. This Convention also provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to residents who are engaged in treaty-shopping or with respect to certain abusive transactions.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 13, 1999.
