    Lois Capps and her family have served the people of California's Central Coast for almost four decades. For 20 years, she was a nurse and public health advocate while her husband Walter served in Congress. When Walter tragically passed away, Lois ran for his seat in Congress, and for the past 17 years, she has continued his legacy of service while leaving a lasting legacy of her own. She has led efforts to increase access to health care, improve mental health services, detect and prevent domestic violence, protect our environment, and improve education, all while consistently being voted the "nicest Member of Congress." Her experience, optimism, and tenacity will be missed, but I look forward to working with Congresswoman Capps over the next 2 years, and Michelle and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.
