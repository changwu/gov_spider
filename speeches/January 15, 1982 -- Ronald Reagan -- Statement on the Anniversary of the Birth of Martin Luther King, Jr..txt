    There are moments in history when the voice of one inspired man can echo the aspirations of millions. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was such a man. To America he symbolized courage, sacrifice, and the tireless pursuit of justice too long denied. To the world he will be remembered as a great leader and teacher, a man whose words awakened in us all the hope for a more just, more compassionate society.
He dreamed of an America in which our children "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character," and he reminded us that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." His time among us was cut tragically short, but his message of tolerance, nonviolence, and brotherhood lives on.
On this the 53d anniversary of his birth, let us all rededicate ourselves to making Martin Luther King's inspiring dream come true for all Americans.
