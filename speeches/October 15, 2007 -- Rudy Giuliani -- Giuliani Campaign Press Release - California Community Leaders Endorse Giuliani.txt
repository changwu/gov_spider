    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsements of Santa Ana City Councilman Carlos Bustamante and San Jose City Councilman Pete Constant. They join other county supervisors and former state officials throughout California supporting Mayor Giuliani for President.
"Rudy has become the clear choice of voters in California and his commitment to the state is unmatched by any other candidate in the race," said Giuliani's California State Chairman Bill Simon. "As a former Mayor, Rudy knows the challenges city and county governments face, which is why he is committed to ensuring that California's local communities have the resources they need to provide citizens with the highest quality of life."
Today's endorsements follow the "Super Saturday" grassroots effort this past weekend, where supporters gathered to help build on Rudy's momentum across the state.
