    The goal of degrading and destroying ISIL will never be achieved with the current Obama-Clinton 'strategy.' It is good that Governor Bush understands we need to do more to destroy ISIL. Unfortunately, his proposal is woefully inadequate when it comes to the U.S. ground component needed to destroy ISIL.
With mere incremental changes to the failed Obama policy, the best we could hope for would be the dangerous status quo. Make no mistake, the fight against radical Islamic terrorism is a regional problem which must be addressed on all fronts at once to be successful.
Without a substantial U.S. presence in Syria and Iraq, it is just a matter of time before ISIL further destabilizes the Middle East and launches an attack against our homeland. There are not enough individuals in Syria that can be efficiently trained to successfully destroy ISIL and topple Assad, which are necessary objectives if we hope to stabilize the region.
While a no fly zone in Syria is a step in the right direction, without a ground component it is doomed to fail. It is imperative that regional ground forces be formed in large numbers to destroy ISIL and push Assad aside. For this regional force to be effective and successful, it will require integration of American troops. The American component could range from 5,000 to 10,000 depending on how the force is formed.
I have learned from President Bush's mistakes, President Obama's mistakes, and certainly, my own mistakes, that these are difficult truths. It is disappointing that the president and so many candidates running for the office are unwilling to take these necessary and bold steps before it is too late. In my view, those reluctant to call for boots on the ground, the only strategy that ensures a stable Middle East and a secure America, are not prepared to be Commander-in-Chief.
