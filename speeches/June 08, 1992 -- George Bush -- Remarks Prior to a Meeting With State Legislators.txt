    Welcome, all. Thank you very much for coming.
Let me just make a short statement here before we close the door and get into hearing from you all on this important amendment. But 44 States have constitutional provisions relating to a balanced budget. Passing a balanced budget amendment, in my view, is essential to the long-term economic health of this country. This is an idea whose time has come. We've been for it for a long, long time.
I want to hear from each of you as to how you think we can best get this done. But I appreciate your being here. It is priority. I think the country is sick and tired of deficits. This will help discipline the executive and the legislative branch, and we've got to get it done. So I appreciate your coming, and we'll see where we go here.
