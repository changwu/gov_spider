Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking! https://t.co/Fe7XkepJNNRetweets: 23508Favorites: 67793

...And a swamp creature with "pull" was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want Stone to serve 9 years for. A phony Mueller Witch Hunt disgrace. Caught! https://t.co/6baxv3LvukRetweets: 17563Favorites: 55432

Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podesta's BROTHER? Wasn't he caught, forced to leave his firm, with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him, only to the "other" side?Retweets: 33620Favorites: 114823

Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a "nice cold beer" with her husband!Retweets: 30656Favorites: 160681

Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa, and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did, is it?Retweets: 19819Favorites: 87840

Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the Mueller Scam, and shouldn't ever even have started? 13 Angry Democrats?Retweets: 29283Favorites: 111641

The Fake News Media is looking hard for the Big Democrat Story, but there is nothing too fabulous. Wouldn't a big story be that I got more New Hampshire Primary Votes than any incumbent president, in either party, in the history of that Great State? Not an insignificant fact!Retweets: 28614Favorites: 126693

Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). That's why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.Retweets: 23823Favorites: 97255

Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!Retweets: 35641Favorites: 133204

Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature, yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlsonRetweets: 24718Favorites: 92073

It is very important for our Country's SECURITY that the United States Senate not vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution. We are doing very well with Iran and this is not the time to show weakness. Americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist Soleimani....Retweets: 33988Favorites: 136506
