    Dear Jack:
It is with profound regret that I accept your resignation, effective March 13, 1987.
I appreciate your coming aboard March 1 to help me pull things together. I admired the enthusiasm with which you plunged into the job, and your loyalty to me. Your selflessness was demonstrated again by your gracious recognition that Howard Baker must have every opportunity.
In the decade or more that we have known each other I always enjoyed our correspondence. You certainly were one of my earliest supporters and I valued the advice you have given me from time to time over the years. I know I can count on you in the future.
Nancy joins me in wishing you and Dorothy Godspeed and, most importantly, good health for you both. God bless you.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
Dear Mr. President:
I recognize and endorse the importance that Senator Baker must have his own team with whom he will feel comfortable to carry out your program so vital for the American people. I therefore ask you please to accept my resignation effective March 13.
I have known you for many years and have believed totally in your goals for the United States and for the world from the first day we met in the early 70s. Thus, I welcomed the privilege to serve you albeit briefly. Of course, I was pleased and inspired by our conversation when I accepted your appointment of me. I shall always treasure this memory.
Dorothy and I wish you and The First Lady good health, good fortune and happiness. We will continue to pray that God may grant you the strength to carry out your awesome duties for the benefit of our country and for the world.
Respectfully,
JACK
