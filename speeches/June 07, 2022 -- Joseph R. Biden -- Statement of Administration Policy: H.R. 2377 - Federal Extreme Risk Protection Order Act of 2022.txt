    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. McBath, D-GA, and Rep. Carbajal, D-CA)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2377, the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act of 2022. The President has called on Congress to act now to reduce gun violence and save lives. This legislation would make significant progress toward keeping guns out of dangerous hands.
The President has repeatedly called for Congress to pass Federal legislation on extreme risk protection orders and incentivize States to adopt similar laws of their own. An extreme risk protection order is a common-sense, effective measure to empower family members, health care providers, school officials, or law enforcement officers to petition a court to temporarily prevent a person from accessing firearms if they are found to be a danger to themselves or others. That is why, last year, the Department of Justice issued model legislation for States to consider on extreme risk protection orders that would allow such individuals to seek orders and intervene before warning signs turn into tragedy. H.R. 2377 would build on the Administration's executive action to further expand the use of Federal extreme risk protection orders.
The Administration urges the Congress to pass H.R. 2377 and send the measure to the President's desk.
