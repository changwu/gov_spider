    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report four proposals to rescind a total of $114.1 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. The rescission proposals affect programs in the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. These proposals are a part of my continuing effort to help reduce government spending.
The details of the rescission proposals are contained in the attached reports.
