    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c),
I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, find that the expulsion from Kuwait of Iraq's occupation forces, the restoration of Kuwait to its citizens, and the reinstatement of the lawful Government of Kuwait eliminate the need for Executive Order No. 12723 of August 2, 1990, entitled "Blocking Kuwaiti Government Property," and Executive Order No. 12725 of August 9, 1990, entitled "Blocking Kuwaiti Government Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Kuwait." Those orders were issued to protect the assets of the Government of Kuwait which were subject to United States jurisdiction, and to prevent the transfer of benefits by United States persons to Iraq based upon its invasion of Kuwait. Those orders also implemented the foreign policy and protected the national security of the United States, in conformity with applicable resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. Finding continuation of these orders unnecessary, I hereby order:
Section 1. Executive Order No. 12723 and Executive Order No. 12725 are hereby revoked. This revocation shall not affect the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12722 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the policies and action of the Government of Iraq.
Sec. 2. This revocation shall not affect:
(a) any action taken or proceeding pending and not finally concluded or determined on the effective date of this order;
(b) any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to the effective date of this order; or
(c) any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 3. This order shall take effect immediately.
George Bush
The White House,
July 25, 1991.
