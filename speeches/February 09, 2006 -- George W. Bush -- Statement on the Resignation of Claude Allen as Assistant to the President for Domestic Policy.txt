    Claude Allen has been a trusted adviser since 2001. As Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, he worked hard to improve the health and welfare of all Americans. During the past year, he has served as my top domestic policy adviser at theWhite House and has helped develop policies that will strengthen our Nation's families, schools, and communities.
Claude is a good and compassionate man, and he has my deep respect and my gratitude. I thank him for his many years of principled and dedicated service to our country. Laura and I wish Claude, Jann, and their family all the best.
