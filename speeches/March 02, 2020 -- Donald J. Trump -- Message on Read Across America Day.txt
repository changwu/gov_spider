    As millions of students across the United States celebrate Read Across America Day, Melania and I are pleased to join them in celebrating the wonders of reading and literature, while also honoring our Nation's outstanding educators, librarians, and families who support America's remarkable young people.
Read Across America Day is a celebration of the joys of literacy and an important reminder that we must make every effort to ensure that our Nation's children receive the necessary education in reading and writing to cultivate the skills they need to pursue their American Dream. To help all of America's students unlock their full potential in the classroom, my administration emphasized the importance of education and literacy in our most recent budget by investing $19.4 billion in a new education block grant. This critical funding will allow States and school districts to focus on the needs of their students, including literacy and language arts, and will make a difference in the lives of students in communities across our Nation, empowering them with the tools and knowledge to fuel successful careers and fulfilling lives.
In classrooms, libraries, and homes around our country, literature provides children with the inspiration to learn and grow. On this Read Across America Day, we recall the motivational words of Dr. Seuss—an American icon of literature—and impart his wisdom on our Nation's young people: "You're off to Great Places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting, so . . . get on your way!"
