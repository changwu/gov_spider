    Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) today called on the United States Senate to vote on President Obama's Iran nuclear agreement as a full treaty because the President has violated the terms of the Corker-Cardin agreement by not submitting it to Congress.
Rick Santorum said:
"The facts are clear. President Obama has violated the terms of the Corker-Cardin agreement. By not submitting his Iranian agreement and all related materials to Congress, President Obama has made the terms of Corker-Cardin moot. Majority Leader McConnell should immediately call for a vote on the ratification of the Iran deal, treating it as a treaty as outlined in the Constitution. It is time for the Republican Senate to use their constitutional authority, stand up as an equal branch of government, and vote down this threat to global security."
