    The President spoke with Afghan presidential candidates Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Dr. Ashraf Ghani today to thank them for their leadership in reaching an agreement to form a national unity government and to accept the outcome of the full audit of the ballots in the June 14 run-off election currently being undertaken by the election commissions. He commended the two candidates for putting the interests of Afghanistan first and committing to working together as partners in governance. Noting that the audit is steadily progressing, the President encouraged both candidates to publically endorse their previously agreed political framework and continue their dialogue on the details of its implementation to ensure the Afghan people have full confidence in the ongoing electoral process and outcome. He reiterated that there is no justification for rhetoric that threatens extra-constitutional measures and urged Dr. Abdullah and Dr. Ghani to continue to move forward in the spirit of collegiality to maintain national unity during this historic democratic transition. The President indicated that Secretary Kerry would continue his close consultations with the two candidates and President Karzai in the days to come. The President also reaffirmed the enduring American commitment to the Afghan people and their future.
