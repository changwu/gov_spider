    Our campaign has always been about defeating President Obama and a new poll over the weekend confirms that we are better positioned to defeat the President than Mitt Romney.
In Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia (four critical states) our campaign is polling 4% better than President Obama, while the Romney campaign is polling 4% worse than the President.
Americans want leadership and a concrete plan of action. They don't want more equivocation and policy half-steps. That's why we can beat Obama and Mitt Romney never can.
The numbers show us what we already know in our hearts. Our conservative principles and ideas are the key to winning in the fall.
