    Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"I applaud Governor Romney for his bold leadership in outlining a sensible plan to let our nation harness its abundant and clean energy resources.  Securing our energy independence and developing our diverse natural resources in a manner that protects and enhances our environment is critical to long-term, sustainable job creation.  As a former governor, Mitt Romney understands the magnitude of this task and the demonstrated ability of states to lead these efforts, and he will ensure this issue is a top priority in his Administration."
