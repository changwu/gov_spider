    SAVANNAH, Ga. â€“ A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday issued the following statement in response to a series of tax proposals by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton:
"Given the disappearing middle class and massive income and wealth inequality in America today, we clearly have to go a lot further than what Secretary Clinton proposes. We need to raise Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250,000. We need to pass excellent legislation by leading Democrats in Congress to provide paid family and medical leave. We need to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right, not a privilege," said Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs.
"It's too late for tentative half-steps that sound Republican-lite," he added.
Here are just a few of the specific proposals that Sanders has introduced that are better for the middle class.
