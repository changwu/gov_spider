    The people of the United States extend our deepest condolences to the victims of the ongoing eruption of Fuego Volcano in Guatemala. At the request of the Government of Guatemala, we are sending emergency aid, including financial resources to help meet food, water, and sanitation needs for the affected population. The United States is also sending aircraft to assist in transporting burn victims of this terrible event for treatment in Florida. We will continue to coordinate with the Guatemalan government to provide further aid where needed.
