    56. In the 21st century we face new challenges with global impacts, including those we have addressed at this Summit. In responding to these challenges, international institutions have a key role to play, and we reaffirm our commitment to supporting them. We encourage ongoing open dialogue and work on reforming and adapting international institutions so that they be able to respond effectively.
