    The President has signed H.R. 6686, the Congressional Reports Elimination Act.
This legislation will cut Government redtape. It eliminates over 100 reports prepared each year by Government agenciesâ€”reports that hardly anyone reads but that the taxpayers pay for. This bill will save over $8 million per year.
The key sponsors of this bill were Representatives Jack Brooks and Donald Albosta. They deserve credit for this bill and for their efforts on the broad paperwork reduction act, which has passed the House and will be before the Senate in November.
