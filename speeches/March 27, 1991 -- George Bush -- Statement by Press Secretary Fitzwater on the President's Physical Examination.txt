    President Bush today completed a routine physical examination at Bethesda Naval Hospital and is in excellent health. The President's examination lasted approximately 5 hours. The physical was conducted under the direction of Dr. Burton Lee, the President's personal physician.
"The President continues in excellent health," Dr. Lee said. "There were no surprises at the physical exam. He remains an extraordinarily vigorous man who continues to thrive on a great deal of physical activity and a rigorous, demanding work schedule."
Ophthalmologists continue to test the President for any progression of his glaucoma, but his condition remains stable. No treatment appears to be indicated at the present time.
Among his other test results are: chest x-ray, normal; x-rays of hips and neck, mild degenerative osteoarthritis; electrocardiogram (EKG) and stress test, normal; urinalysis, no abnormalities; normal urologic exam; colonoscopy within normal limits; blood tests completely normal, including cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein levels; dermatology, no significant problem or change; and his allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged.
