In-town pool report #1 
Good morning from the White House!
I'll be your in-town print pooler today. It's a beautiful partly cloudy day in D.C. and 82 degrees.
As is the custom, pool was tested in lower press this morning for COVID-19. No news is good news on that front.
On POTUS' public schedule is a visit to the Korean War Veterans Memorial in D.C. for a wreath laying ceremony, then his trip to Wisconsin. I'll let you know if anything changes.

In-town pool report #2 
Motorcade started rolling at 11:16 en route to the Korean War memorial.
Spotted entering the motorcade prior to departure was National Security Adviser to VPOTUS Gen. Keith Kellogg. No sighting of POTUS.
The Supreme Court ruling this morning for the Trump administration was big news. Pool has made an inquiry with the WH press office on whether POTUS was briefed on the decision.

In-town pool report #3 
After an uneventful trip, motorcade arrived at its destination outside Lincoln Park at 11:19, then pool hastened to the Korean War memorial.
A wreath is already positioned as are service members carrying military flags and veterans. Spotted at the ceremony is VA Secretary Wilkie. No masks on anyone.

In-town pool report #4 
POTUS, wearing a dark suit and red tie, and FLOTUS, wearing a black spotted outfit, entered the Korean War memorial at 11:23, then paid respects before the wreath.
Here's a photo to give you an idea: https://twitter.com/status/1276174734309445633?s=21
The two backed off and formed a line with a military official, then POTUS saluted and FLOTUS stood motionless as a trumpeter played the song “Taps.”
POTUS then with FLOTUS beside him interacted inaudibly with observers, including what appear to be administration officials, then Korean War veterans.
Here's good background on the Korean War memorial at a D.C. tourism website: https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44f...
Pool is holding as POTUS interacts with event participants.
