    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Pennsylvania State Representative Katie True.
"I'm honored to earn the support of such a principled state leader as Katie," said Mitt Romney. "Pennsylvania voters are looking for a candidate that will stand up for pro-growth policies that will empower small businesses and rebuild the middle class. In the coming months, I look forward to working with Katie to make this vision a reality."
"Over the last few months, it has become clear to me that Mitt Romney is the one candidate that can defeat Barack Obama and put in place the policies that will restore America's promise for all generations," said former Pennsylvania State Representative Katie True. "There are several candidates that talk the conservative talk, but we also need someone who knows how to make these ideas a reality. Mitt Romney hasn't spent his life in Washington. He is a conservative businessman who has created thousands of middle class jobs and has actually had to balance a budget. I cannot think of more appropriate qualities for a president today. That is why I am proud to stand with Mitt and call on my fellow Pennsylvanians who want to turn this country around to join me."
