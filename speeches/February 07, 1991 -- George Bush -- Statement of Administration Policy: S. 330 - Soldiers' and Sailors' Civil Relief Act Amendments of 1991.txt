    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Cranston (D) CA and 32 others)
On January 25, 1991, the Administration transmitted to Congress a draft legislative proposal, "To amend the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940." That proposal would address the concerns of Reserve Forces activated for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. It would provide Reservists on active duty with protection in court proceedings and protection from adverse action by creditors. It would also protect their dependents from eviction. In addition, the Administration supports providing professional liability protection for certain military personnel.
S. 330 has the same goals as the Administration's proposal. The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 330.
The Administration, however, strongly opposes a proposed amendment to S. 330 to be offered by Senator Heinz. As stated in a February 7, 1991, letter (attached) from the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Senate leadership, this amendment is unwarranted and unwise. The amendment would express the sense of the Senate that military couples and single parents with minor children should be barred from assignment to the Operation Desert Storm theater. The Administration believes it would be a serious mistake, especially in the midst of combat, to reverse the Department of Defense's longstanding policy that such personnel are available for duty worldwide. Moving them now would weaken combat capability by undermining troop cohesion and esprit de corps. It would also be unfair to single parents and military couples and to their comrades who depend on them every day.
