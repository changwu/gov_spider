    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan spoke on the phone today with Prime Minister of Kosovo Albin Kurti. Mr. Sullivan conveyed condolences for the loss of the Kosovo police officer slain in the line of duty during the violent attacks that took place on September 24. He also expressed concern about Serbian military mobilizations near the Kosovo border. He noted recent decisions by NATO to bolster the NATO Kosovo Force's (KFOR) presence and activity, especially in northern Kosovo, and underscored the readiness of the United States to work with our Allies to ensure KFOR remained appropriately resourced to fulfill its mission. In addition, Mr. Sullivan and Prime Minister Kurti discussed the EU-facilitated Dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which Mr. Sullivan underscored was the only long-term solution to ensuring stability throughout Kosovo.
