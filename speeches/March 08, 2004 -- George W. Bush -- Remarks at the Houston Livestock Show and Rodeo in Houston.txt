I worked the ropeline, worked the fenceline coming out. I can't tell you how many people said, "Mr. President, we're praying for you in Iraq." On behalf of a grateful world, I want to thank you for that very much. And I want to thank you for your hospitality. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless America.
