    House Majority Leader Eric Cantor today made the following statement on President Obama's failure to visit Israel during his first term:
"President Obama's promise to visit Israel in his second term comes four years too late, and is emblematic of the lack of close coordination with Israel Candidate Obama led us to expect in 2008. It also does not make up for the many shortcomings of his Middle East policy, ranging from the fact that Iran continues to race forward with its nuclear weapons program to his administration's haplessness in the face of Syria's support of terrorism, threats to use weapons of mass destruction and support of instability in the region. Our relationship with Israel should be a priority, not a distraction. President Obama has found time to visit dozens of other nations — including some near to Israel in the Middle East — and his treatment of our closest ally in the region has been profoundly disappointing."
