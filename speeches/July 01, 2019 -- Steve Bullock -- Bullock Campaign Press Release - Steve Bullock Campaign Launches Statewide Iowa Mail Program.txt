    Building On Early Iowa Investments, New Mailer Will Reach 100,000 Households Statewide
Des Moines, IA – Today, Bullock for President announced a statewide mail program targeting Iowa Caucus voters. The effort builds on the campaign's early investments in the first caucus state and is one of the first mail programs of the 2020 Iowa Caucus.
"Governor Bullock is a red-state governor with a blue-state record. As the only candidate who has won a Trump state, Governor Bullock can both win this election and has the pragmatic, progressive agenda to get our country back on track," said Iowa State Director Megan Simpson. "Our campaign will go the extra mile to share Governor Bullock's vision with voters in every corner of Iowa. From early organizing investments to key endorsements, Governor Bullock is building a team to compete everywhere — and we're excited to take new steps to bring our message straight to Iowans where they live."
Governor Bullock has received endorsements from two key Iowa Democratic leaders. On his first trip to Iowa, Governor Bullock was endorsed by 37-year Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, and ahead of the first debate, he was endorsed by DNC Member and 22-year former Story County Chair Jan Bauer.
