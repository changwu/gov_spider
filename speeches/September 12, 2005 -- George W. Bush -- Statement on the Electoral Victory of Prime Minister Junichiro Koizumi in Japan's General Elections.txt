    I extend my congratulations to Prime Minister Koizumi for his decisive victory in yesterday's elections and to the Japanese people for continuing Japan's robust democratic tradition. Prime Minister Koizumi is a bold leader and a good friend, and I look forward to continuing the close partnership between our two countries.
