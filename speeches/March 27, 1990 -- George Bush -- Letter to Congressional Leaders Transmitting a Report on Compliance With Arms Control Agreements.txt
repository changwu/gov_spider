    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
Pursuant to section 52 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2592), I am pleased to transmit the enclosed report on the adherence of the United States to arms control treaty obligations and on problems related to compliance by other nations with the provisions of arms control agreements to which the United States is a party.
This report was prepared by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in coordination with the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence.
In previous reports to the Congress, I have made clear that the United States expects scrupulous compliance from its arms control treaty partners. For its part, the United States continues to take seriously its commitments to arms control agreements and sets rigid standards and procedures for assuring that it meets these obligations.
Sincerely,
George Bush
