    The Senate's bipartisan passage of trade promotion authority completes an accomplishment that has eluded Congress since 1994 and is a major victory on behalf of working Americans. With TPA, we will open markets to create high-paying jobs and provide new opportunities for America's farmers and workers. I thank the House and Senate for passing TPA so that we can work together to advance America's free trade agenda. With this important tool, we will promote prosperity in the United States, progress in our hemisphere, and freedom throughout the world.
