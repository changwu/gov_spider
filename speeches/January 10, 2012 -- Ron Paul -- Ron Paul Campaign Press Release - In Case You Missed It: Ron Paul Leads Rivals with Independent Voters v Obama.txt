CBS Poll: Independents Prefer Ron Paul Vs Obama

In a head to head match up with incumbent President Barack Obama, the indie voter chooses Ron Paul, a CBS News poll suggested on Monday.
A total of 47% of independent voters said they would choose Ron Paul compared to 45% of independent voters choosing Mitt Romney against Obama, and 41% of independents saying they would choose Rick Santorum. If a Paul-Obama showdown were ever to take place, 47% of independent voters would vote for Paul, 81% republicans and 10% Democrats for a total of 45% of the vote. Obama would get just 40% of the independent vote in that contest, with 85% of the Democrats choosing Obama and 9% of Republicans choosing the President on election day in November. Obama would win the general election by a narrow one point margin if the election was held today between the two.
However, Ron Paul is not the favorite among conservatives polled. Romney is the leader there, getting 90% of the conservative vote, followed by Texas governor Rick Perry at 85%. Ron Paul comes in tied with Newt Gingrich at No. 4 with 81% of conservatives voting for that particular candidate.
Romney is the only GOP candidate seen beating Obama in November by a two point margin, according to the poll. Paul is in second.
