    Yesterday, a single district court in Oregon has decided immigration policy for the Nation. Congress plainly provided the President with broad authority to impose additional restrictions or limitations on the entry of aliens into the United States. The relevant portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides: "Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate." And in a landmark decision last year, the Supreme Court recognized the President's broad authority to so impose such restrictions. That broad authority formed the foundation of this most recent proclamation that was designed to protect the United States from the detrimental effects of uninsured immigrants. The district court's decision enjoining the proclamation disregards the statute's text, in violation of the Supreme Court's decision. We look forward to defending the President's lawful action.
