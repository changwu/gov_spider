    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the violence at a UN compound in Malakal that led to the killing of internally displaced persons, and the burning and looting of a facility that provides refuge and aid to over 40,000 victims of the conflict in South Sudan. We are especially disturbed by credible reports that a large group of South Sudanese Government soldiers entered the compound and opened fire on civilians seeking refuge within the camp. We call on the Government of South Sudan immediately to conduct an investigation of this violence, to identify the soldiers responsible, and to bring the perpetrators to justice. We express our condolences to the families of those killed, including two Médecins Sans Frontières humanitarian workers, and we call on all South Sudanese parties to exercise restraint and avoid retributive violence in the coming days.
The lack of progress by the parties to implement the August 2016 peace agreement, as well as the government's decree to establish 28 states without local consultations, have undermined prospects for achieving peace. We call on President Salva Kiir to suspend implementation of the decree and on both parties to make rapid progress in implementing the agreement, including establishing the needed security arrangements and forming the transitional government.
