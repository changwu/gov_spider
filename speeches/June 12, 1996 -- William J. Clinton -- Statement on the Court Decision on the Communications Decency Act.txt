    The Justice Department is reviewing today's three-judge panel court decision on the Communications Decency Act. The opinion just came down today, and the statute says we have 20 days to make an appeal.
I remain convinced, as I was when I signed the bill, that our Constitution allows us to help parents by enforcing this act to prevent children from being exposed to objectionable material transmitted through computer networks. I will continue to do everything I can in my administration to give families every available tool to protect their children from these materials. For example, we vigorously support the development and widespread availability of products that allow both parents and schools to block objectionable materials from reaching computers that children use. And we also support the industry's accelerating efforts to rate Internet sites so that they are compatible with these blocking techniques.
