In-Town Pool Report 3 - Departure/ A Dandelion for FLOTUS 
POTUS and FLOTUS arrived at the Ellipse at 11:18am and boarded Marine One shortly after. Just before they boarded, POTUS stopped and picked up a dandelion from the ground and handed it to FLOTUS.
Both waved to pool but did not come over for questions.
M1 and a second chopper were wheels up at 11:23am.
A quick note: Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre will gaggle with reporters on AF1 en route to Georgia. The gaggle will be livestreamed at whitehouse.gov/live so pool will not be sending notes on this unless there are issues with the livestream.
