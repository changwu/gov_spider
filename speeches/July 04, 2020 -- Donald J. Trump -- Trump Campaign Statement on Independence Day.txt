    In celebration of Independence Day, Lara Trump, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. issued the following statement:
"On behalf of everyone at Team Trump, we want to wish America a happy Independence Day. While the past few months have not been easy, this special holiday is a great reminder of America's unbreakable spirit and our national perseverance. For nearly 250 years, our country has endured every challenge and obstacle that has threatened her survival -- and she will continue to be the brightest beacon of liberty and freedom in the world. Today, we also join President Trump in honoring the brave men and women in uniform who have helped make America great, as well as millions of courageous medical workers, manufacturers, and first responders who have helped defeat the worst of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Happy Independence Day, America!"
