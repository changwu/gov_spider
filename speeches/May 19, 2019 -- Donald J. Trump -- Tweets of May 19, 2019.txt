Never a fan of @justinamash a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great Republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy.

....he would see that it was nevertheless strong on NO COLLUSION and ultimately NO OBSTRUCTION...Anyway how do you Obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side?

Watched some of the Fake News Political Shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way. The Mainstream Media should be ashamed of itself - But the good news is that the USA is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception!Retweets: 21774Favorites: 87504

Hard to believe that @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete as Chris Wallace likes to call him. Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems. They got dumped from the Democrats boring debates and they just want in. They forgot the people.....Retweets: 20918Favorites: 89131

....who got them there. Chris Wallace said 'I actually think whether you like his opinions or not that Mayor Pete has a lot of substance...fascinating biography.' Gee he never speaks well of me - I like Mike Wallace better...and Alfred E. Newman will never be President!Retweets: 16990Favorites: 79243
