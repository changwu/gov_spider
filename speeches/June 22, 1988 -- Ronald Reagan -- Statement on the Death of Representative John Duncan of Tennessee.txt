    With great sadness, I learned that John Duncan passed away. Nancy and I will miss our good friend, and our prayers are with Lois and the Duncan family.
John was first elected to the House in 1964 to the seat held by Howard Baker's father and then his mother. He set the highest standards of excellence and integrity in public service. The Nation and the people of the State of Tennessee have benefited beyond measure from his statesmanship and commitment to the national wellbeing.
