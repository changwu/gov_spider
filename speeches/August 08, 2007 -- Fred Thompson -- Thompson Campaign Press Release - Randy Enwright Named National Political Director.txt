    McLean, Va. - Randy Enwright, a Florida native and a veteran campaign and political operative, was officially named as the National Political Director for the Friends of Fred Thompson testing the waters committee.
"Randy has the background, skill set, and proven track record to help us move forward," said former Senator Fred Thompson. "He is one of the most respected political operatives in the nation and his understanding of grass-roots organizing is second to none. We are very fortunate to have him on board and to have someone of his caliber leading our political activity."
Enwright has extensive experience in Florida where he was executive director of the State Republican Party prior to being a consultant to the Republican National Committee (RNC).
In addition to being a senior advisor to President George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns, he was also a senior advisor to the re-election campaign of Florida Governor Jeb Bush in 2002.
Enwright worked for President George H. W. Bush as his Missouri campaign director in the 1987-88 presidential election.
Enwright's political network and experience is broad and deep, according to the Thompson committee. He has been regional political director for the RNC covering Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Iowa.
From 1989 to 1992, Enwright was the executive director of the Iowa Republican Party after a turn as political director of the Missouri GOP in the 1985-86 election cycle.
"I am honored to have been chosen to help direct the political portion of this effort," Enwright said. "Working with Fred is far more than just another political job; it is an opportunity to be an important part of a great team."
