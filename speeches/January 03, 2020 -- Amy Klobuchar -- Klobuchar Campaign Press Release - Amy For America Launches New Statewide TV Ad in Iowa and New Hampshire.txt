     Following Strongest Fundraising Quarter Yet, 'What It Takes' Begins Airing Today
MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Today, one month before the Iowa caucuses, Amy For America announced a new television ad, 'What It Takes,' that will begin airing statewide in Iowa and New Hampshire. The six-figure ad buy, which comes after Senator Klobuchar became the only candidate on the January debate stage to visit all of Iowa's 99 counties and toured New Hampshire on a seven town hall swing, highlights her unifying message and her ability to take the fight to Donald Trump.

'What It Takes' Transcript:
AMY KLOBUCHAR: He'll do everything he can to hold on to power, but I'll take the fight to Donald Trump.
I've won in rural, urban, and suburban areas every time. Even districts Donald Trump won.
Whether it's passing 100 laws or standing up to partisan Supreme Court nominees, I've always known that you do a job no matter how hard it is.
Because it's the work that needs to get done.
Our job now is to elect someone who will fix the mess that Donald Trump created and take on the challenges facing America. Like the high costs of prescription drugs, rebuilding our infrastructure, and tackling climate change.
If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you're tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me.
I'm Amy Klobuchar.
I don't want to be the President for half of America, I want to be the President for all of America. That's why I approve this message.
