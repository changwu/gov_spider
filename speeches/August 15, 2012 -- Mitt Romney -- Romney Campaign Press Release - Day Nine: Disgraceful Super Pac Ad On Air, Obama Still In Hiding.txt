    "As President Obama continues his campaign of rage and divisiveness, his disgraceful Super PAC ad is now on the air. President Obama is officially out of excuses. They claim the station aired it by mistake. But if they didn't intend to air it, why would they ship the false ad to TV stations in the first place? President Obama once set the highest expectations and is now engaged in the lowest form of campaigning."  — Matt Rhoades, Romney Campaign Manager
Yesterday, President Obama's Super PAC Shipped And Aired Its Widely Debunked Ad In Ohio — And Promptly Claimed It Was An "Error":

For The Last Week, President Obama's Advisers Have Ducked Calls To Condemn The Ad, Claiming It Had "Not Run Yet":
Obama Campaign Senior Adviser David Axelrod: "It's Not Running, By The Way, The Ad Hasn't Been On The Air." STEPHANOPOULOS: "Does the President stand behind that ad? Does he agree with what was in that ad?" AXELROD: "I don't think anybody - anybody believes that Mr. Soptic's wife, that Governor Romney can be blamed for the death of Mr. Soptic's wife, and frankly, I don't think the ad says that either." STEPHANOPOULOS: "It suggests it, though doesn't it, David?" AXELROD: "But, you know, the irony of all this, the irony of all this, George, is that this ad is running at the very same time that Governor Romney's campaign is running an ad that he paid for - it's not running, by the way, the ad hasn't been on the air..." (ABC's "This Week," 8/12/12)
Obama Campaign Spokeswoman Jen Psaki: "We're Focusing So Much On An Ad That Has Not Run Yet..." PSAKI: "So I think what's clear here, again, is that we are -- hold on, we are about to land -- what's clear here, again, is that we're focusing so much on an ad that has not run yet, that is done by an outside group." (Jen Psaki, Press Gaggle, 8/9/12)
Obama Surrogate Tim Roemer: "It's Not On The Airwaves." BALDWIN: "My question to you is given the facts, and I say that sort of loosely, of this ad and also the tone taken here, Mr. Ambassador, do you think that the president should disavow the ad? And would you, will you, disavow the ad?" ROEMER: "Look, Brooke, I haven't even seen the ad. You said it's not on the airwaves." (CNN's "Starting Point," 8/9/12)
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney: "In How Many States Has The Ad That You're Talking About Aired? ... How Many Dollars Has Been Spent On This Ad?" QUESTION: "Well, this is the super PAC that President -- the one super PAC that President Obama himself allowed his bundlers." CARNEY:  "Well, no, let's talk about size, Brianna.  In how many states has the ad that you're talking about aired?" QUESTION: "Probably 50, if you consider the news, right?" CARNEY:  "And how many -- just based on media reports, how many dollars has been spent on this ad?" (Jay Carney, White House Press Briefing, 8/10/12)
Now That The Ad Has Run, Will President Obama And His Advisers Join Their Fellow Democrats In Condemning The Ad?
Former Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN): "We Need To Also Disavow Ads Like This ... And This Ad Should Not Run And...We Should Say That." "'...My own view is, if we're going to retain our credibility as Democrats to condemn the other side when they go too far, which they have with regard to the president from time to time, we need to also disavow ads like this,' Bayh said on Sunday.
