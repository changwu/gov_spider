    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Reps. McNerney (D) CA, Kagen (D) WI, and Tauscher (D) CA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 700, which would reauthorize a pilot program that Congress has never funded, to provide grants for certain alternative water source projects.
The bill's authorization of $125 million for this pilot program is unrealistic in the current fiscal environment and unnecessary given other Federal funding sources that may be available for such projects.
