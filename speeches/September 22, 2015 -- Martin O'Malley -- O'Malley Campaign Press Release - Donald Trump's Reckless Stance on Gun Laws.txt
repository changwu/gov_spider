    It tells you everything you need to know about today's Republican Party that its frontrunner for President believes immigrants are a bigger threat to this country than assault weapons.
Donald Trump recently released a plan to allow unfettered access to handguns without adequate safety measures like universal background checks. He opposes state laws prohibiting high-capacity magazines and assault weapons. And he proposes federalizing concealed carry permit programs.
This is, quite honestly, reckless and irresponsible.
His proposal is just shameless pandering to the National Rifle Associationâ€”one of the most powerful special interest lobbies in the country. The only thing on which we agree is that our country has a problem with gun violence. But, unlike Donald Trump, I know that the only way to combat gun violence is by standing up to the NRA and implementing comprehensive gun safety laws.
That's exactly what I've done throughout my career, and will do as President. Will you stand with me today?
As President, I will pass a national assault weapons ban, implement stricter background checks, and increase efforts to reduce straw-buying, like fingerprint requirements.
Sign up today to stand with me against gun violence, and read my full policy paper on how I'd address this issue.
