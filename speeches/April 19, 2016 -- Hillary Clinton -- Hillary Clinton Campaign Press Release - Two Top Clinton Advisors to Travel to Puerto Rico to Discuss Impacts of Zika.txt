    Hillary Clinton announced today that two of her top advisors Amanda Renteria and Ann O'Leary will travel to Puerto Rico this weekend to meet with officials and discuss the health care crisis and the threat posed by Zika. There are more than 400 confirmed cases of Zika in Puerto Rico thus far and experts predict that as many as 80 percent of Puerto Ricans could be infected with the virus if it's not stopped. In a statement, Clinton stated the need to do more to assist Puerto Rico in responding to this crisis:
"The CDC is taking this threat seriously and it has been working closely with Puerto Rico. But I want to be sure that we are truly doing all we can to fight the Zika virus from spreading. That's why I'm sending two of my Senior Advisors to travel to Puerto Rico on a fact-finding mission to learn more about how Zika is impacting the island, and to determine what more we can do to assist Puerto Rico in responding to this health crisis. Zika is an urgent problem and we need to act now."
