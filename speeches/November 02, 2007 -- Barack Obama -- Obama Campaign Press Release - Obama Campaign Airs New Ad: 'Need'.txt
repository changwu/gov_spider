    In new TV ad, Obama discusses middle class tax plan
Manchester, NH -- Senator Barack Obama's New Hampshire campaign will begin airing its fifth television ad tomorrow. In the thirty-second spot, entitled "Need," Obama describes American workers as the "bedrock" of our economy and offers his plan to reverse the widening gap between the middle class and the wealthy.
For more than two decades-as a community organizer, a civil rights attorney, a State Senator, and a United States Senator-Obama has been fighting to improve the lives of working Americans. In September he unveiled his Middle Class Tax Fairness plan, which would restore balance to our tax code by closing corporate loopholes, providing tax relief for the middle class-including more than 800,000 working people here in New Hampshire-and eliminating income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000 per year.

SCRIPT - "Need"
Obama (talking to a small crowd): This administration has further divided Wall Street from Main Street. You've got CEOs who are making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year.
Obama (direct to camera): The bedrock, the foundation of our economy is our workers. The middle class have been treading water or worse.
My plan says "Let's restore some balance to our tax code. Close these corporate loopholes the lobbyists put in. And let's make sure that tax breaks are given to people who really need it."
The Obama Plan:
• Close corporate tax loopholes
• $1,000 per family tax cut
• No income taxes on seniors making under $50,000
