    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5164, the Central Intelligence Agency Information Act. It represents an initial effort toward needed reform of Freedom of Information Act requirements. Under its provisions, the Central Intelligence Agency will avoid time-consuming review of certain operational files, which must in any case remain classified to protect intelligence sources and methods, and will devote its resources to expedited review of other information requests. Moreover, this law assures the public of continued access to information that is releasable.
This represents a small but important first step, accomplished in large part because of bipartisan cooperation in both houses. We are especially indebted to the leadership of Senators Goldwater and Moynihan and Representatives Boland and Robinson. I anticipate that in the future such relief will be expanded in scope. And I expect that it will become available to other agencies involved in intelligence, who also must protect their sources and methods and who likewise wish to avoid unnecessary and expensive paperwork.
