    Dear Bill:
I have your letter of September 13, and it is with deepest regret that I accept your resignation as President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, effective on a date to be determined.
While I fully understand the personal considerations which have prompted your decision, I want you to know, as I indicated in our conversation last week, that I would much prefer to have you remain as Bank President. You have been an outstanding member of our team and, needless to say, we will greatly miss your loyal, dedicated services.
For nearly five years, as Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and now as President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, you have brought to your responsibilities a valuable combination of exceptional economic skills and sound political judgment. I am, of course, particularly grateful for your assistance and counsel during the past thirteen months and hope you will always look back on this period of public service with personal pride and satisfaction in the contributions you have made to the well-being of our Nation.
As you return now to private life, Betty joins me in extending to Sophia and you our warmest good wishes for every success and happiness in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable William J. Casey, President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, Washington, D.C. 20571]
