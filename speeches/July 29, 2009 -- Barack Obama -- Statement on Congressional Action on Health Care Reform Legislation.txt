    I want to thank the Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives for continuing their work on health reform to provide more stability and security for Americans who have insurance and quality, affordable coverage for those who don't. I'm especially grateful that so many Members, including some Blue Dogs on the Energy and Commerce Committee, are working so hard to find common ground. Those efforts are extraordinarily constructive in strengthening this legislation and bringing down its cost.
