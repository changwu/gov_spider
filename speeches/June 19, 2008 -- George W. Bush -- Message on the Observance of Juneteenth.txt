    I send greetings to those celebrating Juneteenth.
On Juneteenth, we commemorate the arrival of Major General Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas, and his declaration that slavery had been abolished and the blessings of liberty were finally extended to African Americans.
On this occasion, we recognize the many contributions that African Americans have made to our great Nation and honor the legacy of diversity that America has embraced. Today is an opportunity to recommit ourselves to confronting injustice wherever we find it and upholding the dignity of all people. By doing so, we protect the freedom and democratic ideals that will keep America strong for generations to come.
Laura and I send our best wishes on this memorable occasion.
GEORGE W. BUSH
