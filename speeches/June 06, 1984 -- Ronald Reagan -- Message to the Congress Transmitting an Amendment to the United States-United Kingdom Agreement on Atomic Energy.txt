    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to Section 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the text of an amendment to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes of July 3, 1958, as amended, and my written approval, authorization, and determination concerning the agreement. The joint unclassified letter submitted to me by the Secretaries of Energy and Defense which provides a summary position on the Amendment is also enclosed. A classified letter and attachments are being transmitted directly to the appropriate Congressional committees.
The Amendment extends for ten years (until December 31, 1994) provisions which permit the transfer of nonnuclear parts, source, by-product, special nuclear materials, and other material and technology for nuclear weapons and military reactors.
In my judgment, the proposed Amendment meets all statutory requirements. The United Kingdom intends to continue to maintain viable nuclear forces. In light of our previous close cooperation and the fact that the United Kingdom has committed its nuclear forces to NATO, I have concluded that it is in our interest to continue to assist them in maintaining a credible nuclear force.
I have approved the Amendment, authorized its execution, and urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.
