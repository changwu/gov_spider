    ENCLOSED for your consideration and appropriate reference is proposed legislation entitled the "Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975."
This proposal would extend for an additional five years the basic provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These provisions, including the requirement that certain States and political subdivisions submit to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the Attorney General any changes in voting laws, will be subject to expiration after August 6, 1975.
The proposal would also extend for an additional five years the provision which suspends the use of literacy tests and other similar prerequisites for voting in all states and subdivisions not subject to such suspension under section 4(a) of the 1965 Act.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been an extremely effective statute. Since its enactment, substantial progress has been made in safeguarding and furthering the right to vote. Nonetheless, our experience indicates the need to extend once more the key sections of the Act.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
