The Iowa caucus is just days away: February 1, 2016. And if you've never caucused before—or you know someone who's attending his or her first caucus—we've got you covered.
Caucusing is easy, important, and, yes, even fun. Just take a look at this three-step guide, and share it with a friend.
1. Find out where you're supposed to caucus—just visit hillaryclinton.com/ia to find your caucus location. No matter where you live, there's one nearby.

2. Arrive by 6:30 p.m. on February 1. A volunteer will show you where to go (and explain what to do if you've never caucused before) so you're ready when the caucus starts at 7 p.m.

3. Celebrate ...

... because you just joined thousands of Iowans to defend our progress and keep moving our country forward.

Mark your calendar for February 1, and we'll see you there!
