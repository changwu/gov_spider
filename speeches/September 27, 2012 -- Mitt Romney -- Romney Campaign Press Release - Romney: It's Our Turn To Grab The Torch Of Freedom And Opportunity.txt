But that light looks a little dimmer in some people's minds these days in part because we haven't been willing to deal with the challenges we have. We keep kicking them down the road and hoping that somehow somebody else will deal with it. That time is now ours. This is the greatest generation that left us this nation so prosperous and so free. Now it's our turn." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "The world has always looked to us as that shining city on a hill. But that light looks a little dimmer in some people's minds these days in part because we haven't been willing to deal with the challenges we have. We keep kicking them down the road and hoping that somehow somebody else will deal with it. That time is now ours. This is the greatest generation that left us this nation so prosperous and so free. Now it's our turn. They've held the torch aloft for the whole world to see. A torch of freedom, and opportunity and hope. But they're getting fewer and further between, the greatest generation. They can't hold the torch quite as high as they used to. So, it's our turn to grab that torch and to hold it aloft for the world to see. When I become President of the United States we're going to do what we have to do to get that torch high and very, very bright indeed. We're going to make sure and restore the principles this nation was built upon of freedom and opportunity. We're going to make sure and restore our economy and put people back to work, get rising take-home pay again. And we're going to make sure we have a military that is second to none. I will do those things. I look forward to being the commander-in-chief to being able to keep this nation strong. I make that commitment to you."
