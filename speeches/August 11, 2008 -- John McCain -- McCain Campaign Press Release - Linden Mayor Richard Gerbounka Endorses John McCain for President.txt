    WOODBRIDGE, N.J.-- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced that Mayor Richard J. Gerbounka (Linden, N.J.) has endorsed John McCain for president.
"I am proud to support John McCain for president," said Mayor Gerbounka. "John McCain is a bipartisan reformer with the judgment and experience necessary to lead on the tough issues that matter most to Linden residents."
Mayor Gerbounka formally endorsed John McCain in a press conference held today on the steps of Linden City Hall. State Senator Bill Baroni, who serves as the New Jersey Chairman for John McCain's presidential campaign, was on hand to welcome the endorsement.
"We are pleased to have Mayor Gerbounka on board and his endorsement speaks to John McCain's leadership and broad appeal in New Jersey. The Mayor's support will help swing this heavily-Democratic area for John McCain," Senator Baroni said. "John McCain has always and will always put his country's interests before any party, any special interest and even his own self-interest. The residents of Linden will always know exactly where John McCain stands."
Mayor Gerbounka, a lifelong Democrat who ran as an Independent in 2006, represents a city that is strategically important for Senator McCain's plan to win New Jersey.
Tomorrow, Mayor Gerbounka and Senator Baroni will greet Senator McCain when he arrives in New Jersey. This will be the Senator's sixth campaign stop in the Garden State since declaring his candidacy.
Along with Mayor Gerbounka, Linden City Council members Bruce Howe, Joe Harvanik, Jack Sheehy and Bob Frazier also endorsed John McCain today. Howe, Harvanik and Frazier are Independents; Sheehy is a Democrat.
