    Today, the President signed an Executive Order which takes note of Liberia's tremendous progress since emerging from civil war in 2003, in particular its commitment to democracy and the development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions. The United States congratulates the people of Liberia for their determination, ingenuity, and commitment to peace and democracy that has made this possible. Accordingly, the President has terminated the national emergency declared with respect to Liberia pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in Executive Order 13348 of July 22, 2004 and lifted the economic sanctions imposed pursuant to that Order.
Liberia has worked to overcome not only the scars of war but also the challenge of responding to an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola at a time when Liberians were in the middle of the vital work of consolidating democracy, building their economy, investing in infrastructure, and strengthening their security services. Much remains to be done, especially as Liberia looks ahead to other major milestones including the transfer of security responsibility from the U.N. Mission in Liberia in July 2016 and presidential elections in 2017. Liberia and its people are up to these challenges, and the United States and our international partners will remain steadfast in our commitment to Liberia. Today's announcement is one of what will surely be many more steps as Liberia continues to take charge of its future and live up to its full potential.
