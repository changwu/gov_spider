    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Enclosed are classified and unclassified copies of the Annual Report on Soviet Noncompliance with Arms Control Agreements. This report also subsumes a special report requested on the status of SS - 23s in Eastern Europe and on the Krasnoyarsk radar.
This year, while concerns about Soviet compliance with arms control agreements remain, I can report that the U.S. demand for strict adherence to arms control agreements has yielded positive results in some areas. Nonetheless, a number of compliance issues remain outstanding and several new compliance issues have arisen.
The United States will continue to press the Soviet Union to fulfill all its arms control obligations and to take the actions necessary to correct its arms control violations expeditiously. Anything less than full compliance with past treaties cannot help but affect our judgment with respect to future treaties.
The report represents the Administration's best judgment at a given point in time. As our understanding of certain compliance issues in the report continues to evolve, we will continue to consult with the Congress and seek Soviet redress of our concerns.
Sincerely,
George Bush
