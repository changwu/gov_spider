    President Trump built the greatest economy in the world and as America recovers from the coronavirus outbreak, the President is once again leading a record-breaking Great American Comeback. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has proposed a series of policies written by the radical left that would destroy the economy, including a $4 trillion tax hike and his disastrous version of the Green New Deal. Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of Job Creators Network, and Gladyvette Benarroch of Affordable Landscaping Service and Design discussed all this and more on tonight's 'MAGAnomics' broadcast hosted by Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor.

"A Joe Biden presidency would destroy small businesses and jobs, erasing all the gains we've made in our recovery from the coronavirus outbreak," said Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "The American people know we cannot afford to elect Joe Biden, and that is why you see overwhelming support for President Trump across the country."
"Through historic tax cuts and deregulation, President Trump unleashed American innovation and ingenuity in a way that truly made our country great again," said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of Job Creators Network. "Only President Trump can rebuild our economy - Joe Biden's proposals are simply too far left and too out of touch with Main Street America."
"As a small business owner, I know how dangerous Joe Biden's socialist agenda would be for businesses and workers," said Gladyvette Benarroch of Affordable Landscaping Service and Design. "We need four more years of President Trump to fully rebuild our economy and Make America Great Again."
