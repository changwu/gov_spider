There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Councel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?Retweets: 2041Favorites: 7228

The United States must at long last be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade it is Stupid Trade!Retweets: 31453Favorites: 127689

Why is it that the Wall Street Journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other countries or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into U.S. coffers?Retweets: 19150Favorites: 80115

When you're almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade you can't lose a Trade War! The U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade time to get smart!Retweets: 30370Favorites: 129712
