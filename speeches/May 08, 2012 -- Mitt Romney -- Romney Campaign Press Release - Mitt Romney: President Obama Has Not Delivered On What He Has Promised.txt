Look, I'm very concerned about middle income families that are really struggling. I'm concerned about middle income families who've dropped into poverty. ... Folks are having a hard time out there and this president promised something different than that and his policies failed us." â€“Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "[T]he reduction in the unemployment rate is due entirely to the fact that a large number of people have dropped out of the work force. Had those people not dropped out of the work force, the unemployment rate would be above 10%. This is a presidency that has failed to put in place the kinds of policies that would help the American people. The president says he wants to help. Look, I'm very concerned about middle income families that are really struggling. I'm concerned about middle income families who've dropped into poverty. I meet from time to time with families that are really struggling. Just today I was with a family; they are having a very hard time. They are concerned about being able to meet their obligations and [the] husband has been out of work for over a year. The wife is working a job that's doing pretty well but she's got student loans to pay back that she can't begin to make the payments on. Folks are having a hard time out there and this president promised something different than that and his policies failed us."
