    I appreciate being here with the Secretary-General. He's a leader and a friend. We look forward to working with the United Nations to achieve big objectives. The big objective, of course, is for there to be peace and freedom—peace in the Middle East, freedom for people who are oppressed.
I assured the Secretary-General our Nation will still continue to provide help for famine and disease. We're mostly going to talk about today the need for the United Nations and the free world to work against slavery in all forms, particularly the sex slavery that takes place all over the world— in our civilized world. The world must combine our resources and our will to stop this abhorrent practice.
Mr. Secretary, thank you, sir. It's great to be back.
