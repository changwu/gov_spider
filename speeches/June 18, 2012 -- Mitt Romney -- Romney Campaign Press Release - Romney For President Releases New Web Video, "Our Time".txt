    Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Our Time." Three years after President Obama proudly proclaimed that the economy was his, more than 23 million Americans are still out of work, underemployed, or no longer looking for work and we've seen forty straight months of unemployment over 8 percent. Just last week, the President said the economy "isn't where it needs to be." President Obama has had his moment and failed. Now it is our time.

"The Great Recession shrank Americans' wealth so much that in 2010 median family net worth was no more than it had been in 1992 after adjusting for inflation, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. Median net worth declined from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010, a Fed survey of family finances found. The median marks the point where half had more and half had less."
