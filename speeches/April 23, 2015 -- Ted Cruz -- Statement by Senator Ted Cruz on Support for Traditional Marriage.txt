    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement regarding a report in the New York Times addressing his support for traditional marriage:
"It speaks volumes that the New York Times considers it newsworthy that a Republican who believes marriage is between a man and a woman would meet with people who hold a different view. The purpose of the meeting and the primary topics of conversation were national security, foreign policy, and America's commitment to standing with Israel. On the subject of marriage, when asked, I stated directly and unambiguously what everyone in the room already knew, that I oppose gay marriage and I support traditional marriage.
"One person further asked how Heidi and I would react if we found out one of our (4 and 7-year-old) daughters were gay. My reply: 'We would love her with all our hearts. We love our daughters unconditionally.'
"A conservative Republican who is willing to meet with individuals who do not agree on marriage and who loves his daughters unconditionally may not reflect the caricature of conservatives promoted by the left, but it's hardly newsworthy.
"I know it's been a long time since we've seen it, but this is what it means to truly be a 'big tent Republican' instead of a panderer. I'm happy to go anywhere to anyone to champion conservative values. We're not always going to agree on everything, and I'm not going to change my fundamental values. But at the same time, I'm hoping to offer enough bold leadership on a broad slate of issues that many voters will decide we agree on far more than we disagree."
