    With the passing of former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, our Nation has lost a distinguished diplomat and public servant. Through more than four decades of service, first in the Army and then as a dedicated Foreign Service officer and statesman, Lawrence Eagleburger devoted his life to the security of our Nation and to strengthening our ties with allies and partners. As Deputy Secretary and then Secretary of State under President George H.W. Bush, he helped our Nation navigate the pivotal days during the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. Our Nation is grateful for Secretary Eagleburger's lifetime of service, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, especially his three sons.
