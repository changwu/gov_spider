    Hillary and I were heartbroken when we learned that Timothy West, the 4-year-old boy with leukemia who hugged me so close when I visited him, died this morning in Houston. This precious boy carried the burdens of his illness with courage and a sense of warmth that touched me deeply. Our prayers are with Timothy's parents, Chris and Lisa West, and we especially want to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for pouring so much of themselves into Timothy's treatment and care. On such a sorrowful day, I hope they will feel healed by Timothy's strength and the knowledge that he is now with God.
