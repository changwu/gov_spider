    CHARLESTON, SC — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of Easter:
"He is risen!
"Heidi and I are in Charleston, South Carolina where we attended a beautiful sunrise service.
"As Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we are reminded of the true hope for the world.
"Today I am reminded of the touching anecdote President Reagan once used to explain the prevailing promise of God's word.
"As Reagan said in his famous 'Tear down this wall' speech at the Brandenberg Gate:
"'The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship. The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront. Years ago, before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the television tower at Alexander Platz. Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw, treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind. Yet even today when the sun strikes that sphere—that sphere that towers over all Berlin—the light makes the sign of the cross. There in Berlin, like the city itself, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed.'

"Today is a day to cherish our faith, our freedoms, and all precious gifts that we have been blessed to receive.
"As it is written in Luke 24:7 'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'
"Heidi and I wish you and your family a very Happy Easter."
