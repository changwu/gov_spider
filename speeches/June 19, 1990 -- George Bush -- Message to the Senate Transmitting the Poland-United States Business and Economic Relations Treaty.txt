    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland Concerning Business and Economic Relations, with Protocol and four related exchanges of letters, signed March 21, 1990, at Washington. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to this treaty.
This treaty is the first to be transmitted to the Senate under my initiative to strengthen economic relations with East European countries, in support of the political and economic reforms taking place there. It will encourage, facilitate, and protect U.S. investment and business activity in Poland. The treaty also will serve to stimulate the growth of the private sector and of market institutions in that country. The treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international investment. A tenet of this policy, reflected in this treaty, is that U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment. Under this treaty, the parties also agree to international law standards for expropriation and compensation; free financial transfers; and procedures, including international arbitration, for the settlement of disputes.
I recommend that the Senate consider this treaty as soon as possible and give its advice and consent to ratification of the treaty, with protocol and related exchanges of letters, at an early date.
