    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign released a second new statewide advertisement in Michigan, contrasting the crony capitalist record of Mitt Romney with the free-market, Made-in-the-USA plan of Rick Santorum.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "The differences between Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney couldn't be greater.  Mitt Romney took the unprincipled position of supporting the bailout of his friends on Wall Street while abandoning his 'hometown' of Detroit.  Rick Santorum is a principled conservative that believes that free-markets and free-people are what grows our economy.  Rick's Made-in-the-USA plan will revive areas like Michigan hardest hit by the Obama Administration's encroachment on freedom."

Voice Over:
Who's on the side of Michigan workers?
Not Romney...he supported the Wall Street bailouts, while turning his back on Michigan workers.
But Rick Santorum's made in the USA plan changes everything.  It cuts taxes for Michigan manufacturers to zero, so we can bring back American jobs from overseas.
It also cuts taxes for all workers, and cuts 5 trillion in spending over 5 years, balancing the federal budget.
Rick Santorum, he's fighting for us. 
Rick Santorum:
I'm Rick Santorum, and I approve this message.
