    Health care professionals will join campaign in hosting policy nights across the state to discuss Obama's health care plan
Manchester, NH -- Senator Barack Obama's New Hampshire campaign today announced the membership of the New Hampshire Health Care Community for Obama. The 52-member group covers a broad spectrum of health care professionals, with 22 doctors, 7 mental health professionals, 6 nurses, 9 public policy experts, 5 administrators and 3 State Representatives. The group will coordinate outreach and advise the campaign on health care issues.
"Senator Obama has introduced a common-sense plan to cover every American and save the typical family $2,500 per year-but even more important, he has the ability to bring people together to take this issue head-on," said State Rep. Cindy Rosenwald, chair of the House Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee. "Barack Obama inspires us to believe that change is possible."
On Thursday, the New Hampshire Health Care Community for Obama will launch a statewide series of policy nights to discuss Obama's plan to provide health care for all Americans. Policy nights will be held in Keene, Dover, Derry, Nashua, Manchester, Laconia, and Concord. Details can be found HERE.
**New Hampshire Health Care Community for Obama members are available to speak to the media. Please contact Reid Cherlin for details at (603) 668-2008.
