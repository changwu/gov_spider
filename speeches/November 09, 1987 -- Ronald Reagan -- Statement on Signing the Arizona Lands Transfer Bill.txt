    I am reluctantly signing H.R. 1366, an act to provide for the transfer of certain lands in the State of Arizona and for other purposes. Because of the special conditions in Payson, I am signing this bill. I wish to make it clear that this is an exception and should not be considered a precedent for other cases. The people of this country are entitled to receive full value for the disposal of their Federal lands, and I intend to do what I can to achieve this result.
