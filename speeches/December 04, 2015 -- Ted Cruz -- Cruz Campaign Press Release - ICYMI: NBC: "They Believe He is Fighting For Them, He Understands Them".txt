"Senator Cruz is good at this, he's good at the retail politics of Iowa and that's why he's able to go to from small town to small town. He knows what he's doing and he's a Texan that comes into Iowa and connects with people. He looks them in the eye, he smiles, he shakes his head, he listens, he's able to do a reenactment, he's able to crack jokes, people connect with him and they really feel that when he goes from table to table and has a conversation. Introduces himself to the kids, introduces himself to the entire family people feel like they've actually got this connection.
"They believe he is fighting for them, he understands them, he has two young girls himself that means a lot to these people that they have these families and they really care about family values and when he's able to go in there, share his own personal stories and experiences about his father being an immigrant, that's a big deal and it's a way that resonates with people."
