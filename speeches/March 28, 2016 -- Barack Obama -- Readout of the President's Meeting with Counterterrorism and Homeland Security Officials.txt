    President Obama today met with key members of his counterterrorism and homeland security team to discuss our efforts following the horrific March 22 ISIL terrorist attacks in Brussels. The President was briefed that there is currently no specific, credible intelligence of any plot to conduct similar attacks here in the United States. The President's team also updated him on recent expanded information-sharing with international partners and ways that the United States is working to disrupt and counter external plots emanating from ISIL-controlled territory. Additionally, the President received briefings on ongoing efforts to address ISIL's use of the Internet to recruit followers, incite them to violence, and mobilize them to engage in attacks in the United States and abroad. The President directed his team to continue to intensify efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL and to ensure that the United States is doing everything possible to disrupt any ISIL external plotting efforts, including by continuing our strong leadership in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.
