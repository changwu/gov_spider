GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: "How about on a broader policy in the Middle East? The President said last night that Egypt is not an ally. Do you agree? And what would you do about it?"
MITT ROMNEY: "Well, that's obviously not a reflection of our official policy. American official policy is that Egypt is an ally of the United States. Of course, we recognize that Egypt has gone through a dramatic change in government. And what their status will be going forward in terms of the relationship with our nation is something which I'm sure will be developing over time."
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: "What would you do?"
MITT ROMNEY: "That being said, I would like to bring Egypt closer to us. I think it's important for them to understand that it's an advantage to have a close relationship with the United States, to be an ally of the United States. And for that to continue, Egypt must honor their agreement with Israel, for peace with Israel. Egypt must also respect the rights of minorities in their nation.  And Egypt must also protect the lives and sovereignty of our embassy and of our installations in Egypt. These elements are all essential for us to have the kind of relationship we've had."
