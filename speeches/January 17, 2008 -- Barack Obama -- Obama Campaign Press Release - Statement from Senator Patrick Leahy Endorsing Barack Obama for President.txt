    Senator Patrick Leahy Endorses Barack Obama for President
Thursday, January 17, 2008
Many around the world have lost respect for America and for the hope America once gave them. We are a good and great nation and we can restore that respect but we need a President who can reintroduce America to the world - and to ourselves.
Our nation needs the hope that we can show ourselves and the world the best of America and Barack Obama is the best person to do that.
We need that hope that we can bring the war in Iraq to an end - and our brave men and women can return to their families. We need the hope that all our children will have the education our nation needs.
We need that hope that our resources can turn from war to science as we find a cure for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, AIDS and so many other diseases America, the wealthiest nation on earth, needs the hope of health care for all.
Barack Obama gives us that hope and I am convinced he can lead us to achieve these goals.
Barack Obama represents the America we once were and want to be again -leading with hope, opening the doors of opportunity to all, realizing the potential of our great nation for its citizens and as a leader of the free world. Barack Obama will be a President who once again believes, "Yes, we can." That is why I am endorsing Barack Obama to be the next President of the United States.
