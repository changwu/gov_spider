    IN RESPONSE to the Congressional request that Federal travel should be controlled to restrain the inflationary impact of Federal expenditures and to conserve the use of energy, I have instructed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review Administration actions on this matter of mutual concern. Enclosed is a memorandum from the Director, OMB, that outlines actions taken to restain travel.
The enclosed memorandum, with which I concur, is transmitted to the Congress pursuant to section 205(c) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1976 (Public Law 94-157).
Respectfully yours,
GERALD R. FORD
