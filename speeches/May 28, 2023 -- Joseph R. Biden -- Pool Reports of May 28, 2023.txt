In town pool report #1
Potus returned to the White House earlier than scheduled, landing in Marine One on the South Lawn at 1:33 p.m.
He stopped for just a minute to talk with the pool and said he plans to speak with Kevin McCarthy at 2 p.m. Asked if he is confident the deal will reach his desk, he said, "Yes." Asked what the remaining sticking points are, he said, "None." 


May 28, 2023 13:50

In-town pool report #2
Update: Potus said the call with McCarthy will be at 3 pm., not 2 p.m.
Fuller quote: "I'm going to call McCarthy now at 3 o'clock to make sure all the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted. I think we're in good shape." 


May 28, 2023 14:01

Correcting quote: "I'm about to go in to call McCarthy now at 3 o'clock to make sure all the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted. I think we're in good shape."

For those wondering, the call between POTUS and Speaker McCarthy still hasn't started, but is still expected to happen. No official word on whether POTUS will speak with the pool after it's over.

n-town pool report #7
Two minute warning. 


May 28, 2023 18:43

In-town pool report #8
POTUS appeared at a lectern in the Roosevelt Room and praised the agreement he has reached with Speaker McCarthy: "It's a really important step forward. It takes the threat of catastrophic default off the table, protects our hard-earned economic recovery and the agreement also represents a compromise which means no one got everything they want but that's the responsibility of governing."
Asked about Democrats who worry that he gave away too much, he said, "They'll find I didn't."
Asked about critics who say the deal may take food out of the mouths of poor people, he said, "It's a ridiculous assertion."
POTUS offered no criticism of how McCarthy handled the issue. "I think he negotiated with me in good faith. He kept his word." As for whether the speaker has the votes to pass the deal, POTUS said, "I expect he does."
In response to a question, he offered no comment on the election in Turkey and said only that he has not spoken with President Erdogan.

In-town pool report #10
Some fuller quotes from hard-to-hear tape -- note a couple words different than in the previous pool report. But it's always good to check the transcript later.
POTUS: "We've got good news. I spoke with Speaker McCarthy and we've reached a bipartisan agreement that we're ready to move to the full Congress. And I think it's a really important step forward. It takes the threat of catastrophic default off the table, protects our hard earned and historic economic recovery and the agreement also represents a compromise that means no one got everything they want, but that's the responsibility of governing. This is a deal that's good news for, I believe you'll see, the American people. The agreement prevents the worst possible crisis, a default for the first time in the nation's history and economic recession, retirement accounts devastated, millions of jobs lost but also protects key priorities and accomplishments and values that congressional Democrats and I have fought long and hard for. ...
"As the Speaker and I made clear from the start, the only way forward was a bipartisan agreement. That agreement now goes to the United States House and to the Senate. I strongly urge both, both chambers to pass that agreement. Let's keep moving forward on meeting our obligations and building the strongest economy in the history of the world."
In response to questions, he denied that he had reversed his vow not to negotiate the debt ceiling. "I'm not negotiating the debt ceiling." He was negotiating spending issues in order to get to the debt ceiling, he said. "You want to try and make it look like I made some compromises on the debt ceiling. I didn't. I made a compromise on the budget."
He also said that he would look at invoking the 14th Amendment at some later point, in a year or so. "But that's another day."
On whether McCarthy negotiated in good faith: "I think he negotiated with me in good faith. He kept his word. He said what he would do. He did what he said he would do. I have no idea if he has the votes. I expect he does or I don't think he would have made the agreement."
On Erdogan: "I have not spoken with him yet."
And with that, good night and have a great holiday tomorrow.
