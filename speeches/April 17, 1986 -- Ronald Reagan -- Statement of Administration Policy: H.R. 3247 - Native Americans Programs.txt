    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Kildee (D) MI)
The Administration has proposed legislation to reauthorize the Native American Programs Act, but the Administration opposes H.R. 3247 and recommends that it be removed from the suspension calendar and amended to: (1) eliminate section 2, which would inhibit flexibility to administer the program by specifying in the law a detailed application review process and requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to provide detailed explanations and justifications for its funding decisions; and (2) permit participation in the program of for-profit private Native American organizations.
