    We continue to keep the situation in Iraq under close scrutiny. We have observed no penetrations by Iraqi aircraft of the no-fly zone below 32 degrees north latitude since Wednesday's coalition warning. The disposition of surface-to-air missiles specified in the January 6 warning is less clear. There has been a good deal of movement involving these missiles, but we are still in the process of determining whether Iraq is in compliance with the terms of the coalition demarche.
