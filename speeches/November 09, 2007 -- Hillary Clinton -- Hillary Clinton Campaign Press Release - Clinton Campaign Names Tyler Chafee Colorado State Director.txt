    The Clinton Campaign today announced that veteran Colorado political strategist Tyler Chafee has been named Colorado State Director.
"I'm very pleased to have Tyler Chafee on board as our State Director," said former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, a national Campaign Co-Chair. "Tyler is a talented strategist and organizer who has broad experience running campaigns and ballot initiatives across the state. His hiring demonstrates Hillary Clinton's commitment to winning Colorado and putting resources in the state."
"We're seeing growing support for Hillary across Colorado, and Tyler will be a tremendous asset in harnessing the campaign's grassroots energy statewide," said House Assistant Majority Leader and Clinton supporter Michael Garcia.
Chafee has worked as a National Political Analyst for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and as Political Director for the Colorado AFL-CIO. His campaign management experience ranges from media and grassroots education funds to candidate campaigns. He worked on Diana DeGette's 1996 race for Congress and Dottie Lamm's 1998 race for U.S. Senate. He was most recently a Senior Associate at RBI Strategy and Research in Denver.
"I am joining this campaign because America needs change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Chafee said. "We're going to run an aggressive, grassroots campaign across Colorado and I can't wait to get started."
