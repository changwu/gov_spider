    Tonight, Governor Bill Richardson will raise two million dollars at a single fundraising event with close to a thousand supporters from across New Mexico. 
This event, the largest fundraising event in New Mexico history, comes just three and a half weeks after Governor Richardson announced the formation of a Presidential Exploratory Committee.  
"My wife, Barbara and I are overwhelmed at this tremendous outpouring of support from our fellow New Mexicans, including my friends and colleagues Senator Jeff Bingaman, Congressman Tom Udall, and Lt. Governor Diane Denish," said Governor Richardson. "I plan to use this successful event here at home as the springboard for our fundraising efforts across the country."
