    The administration's decision to seek ratification of the ILO Convention Concerning the Abolition of Forced Labor was based upon the substantial efforts of representatives of U.S. business, labor, and government. The personal involvement of former Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, as Chair of the Committee on the ILO -- the principal body which coordinates the views of business, labor, and government representatives on ILO matters -- brought this 4-year undertaking to fruition. Now, the administration urges the Senate to consider this convention again and to grant its advice and consent to ratification.
