    I really appreciate your hospitality. First of all, I'm really impressed by the quality of the workers who are here. It's obviously reflected in the quality of the product. Harley-Davidson is uniquely American. People love them. And some people are bold enough to drive them, and some of us aren't. [Laughter] I'm hitting the speed limit this year, 55. [Laughter]
But I really appreciate your hospitality and letting us come by and say hello. I can't tell you how great it is to be the President of the greatest country on the face of the Earth. I thank all the—there are more people than I can think that impress me. One of the things that impressed me, besides people's friendliness, is the number of people that said, "I pray for you and your family." For those of you that do that, thanks. It really is something unique about America—you don't have to show me the party registration card. It's really one of the fabulous parts of the job— people from all walks that really care enough about the Presidency that they will do that. I'm just going to keep giving it my best shot. I'm not going to try to figure out which way the wind is blowing—all come down and visit me in Texas.
