    Today, I have signed into law S. 1680, the "Defense Production Reauthorization Act of 2003". The Act extends productionrelated authorities available to the President to provide support for the Armed Forces and meet important civil needs.
Section 123(c) of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992, as enacted by section 7(c) of the Act, purports to require the executive branch to undertake consultations with foreign nations on specific matters and to report thereon to the Congress. The executive branch shall construe section 123(c) in a manner consistent with the constitutional authorities of the President to conduct the Nation's foreign relations and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, the national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, December 19, 2003.
