    No issue illustrates the divide between Washington and the rest of the country better than immigration. Democrats and those on the left see favor amnesty, because they see it as a way to gain political power. Establishment Republicans just see it as a way to lower wages and increase profits. But I see it differently.
We must reduce immigration levels to the United States in order to protect American workers from foreign labor that is taking jobs that Americans could otherwise hold.
If you're with me, then join our campaign today in the fight for system-wide immigration reform that puts American workers first.
