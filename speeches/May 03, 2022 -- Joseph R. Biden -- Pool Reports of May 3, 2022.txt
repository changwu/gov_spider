WH travel pool report 1. — background
Per the WH press office:
The President will travel to Troy, Alabama to visit a Lockheed Martin facility that manufactures weapon systems such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, which the Biden-Harris Administration has been providing Ukraine and the Ukrainians have been effectively using to defend their country against the Russian invasion, including to win the Battle for Kyiv.
The facility the President will tour has produced more than 50,000 Javelin missiles over the last 20 years and employs approximately 600 employees.
** EMBARGOED UNTIL 6:00 AM EDT, TUESDAY, MAY 3**
BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM
TO: Out-of-Town Pool
FROM: White House Press Office
DATE: May 3, 2022
RE: Background on President Biden's Visit to Troy, Alabama
Lockheed Martin's Pike County Operations
Established in 1994, the Pike County Operations facility is a manufacturing, final assembly, and storage operation for many of the missile programs supported by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. Located in Troy, Alabama, the facility sits on nearly 4,000 acres of land, with 52 buildings, including approximately
923,843 square feet of space.
Since it was established, Pike County Operations has produced nearly 190,000 missiles, including more than 50,000 Javelin missiles. This facility supports the final assembly of many Lockheed Martin missiles including Javelins, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missiles, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), Long- Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM), Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM), and HELLFIRE missiles. Pike County Operations also houses the manufacturing of missiles and hardware for a variety of development programs. The employees and facility have won multiple awards for program performance, quality, and security.
Workforce Composition
The Pike County Operations facility employs approximately 600 direct and contractor employees, including 265 who support Javelin production. More than 50 percent is touch labor with the other 50 percent consisting of direct support, including engineering, operations, supply chain management, security, safety, and finance.
Economic Impact
Lockheed Martin has brought nearly 3,000 jobs to Alabama, with an economic impact of more than $900 million since the inception of the Pike County Operations facility.
Production Capacity
The Pike County Operations facility produced nearly 13,000 total missiles in 2021. Currently, the facility has the capacity to produce up to 2,100 Javelin missiles, 468 JASSM and LRASM missiles, 11,000 air-to-ground missiles, and 96 THAAD missiles per year.
** EMBARGOED UNTIL 6:00 AM EDT, TUESDAY, MAY 3**
Javelin
This weapon is a lightweight, man-portable, shoulder-fired, fire-and-forget medium anti-tank weapon system designed to provide high lethality against all known and projected threat armor. It can hit targets up to 2.5 miles away, and has been used very effectively by the Ukrainians to defend their country against the Russian invasion, including to win the Battle for Kyiv. The Ukrainian military has made extensive use of Javelins to damage Russian tanks and artillery throughout the conflict.
Lockheed Martin manufactures the Javelin missiles as part of a joint venture with Raytheon Missiles and Defense, which manufactures the Command Launch Units (CLU) in Tucson, Arizona. The Javelin missile all-up rounds—combined missile and CLU—are final assembled at Lockheed Martin's Pike County Operations facility.
Through eight Presidential Drawdowns under President Biden, over 5,000 Javelin missiles have been transferred to Ukraine from U.S. stocks and nearly 500 more from allies and partners.
POTUS Remarks
The President will deliver remarks about the security assistance the Biden-Harris Administration is providing Ukraine, and he will highlight his request to Congress to pass funding quickly to help Ukraine continue to succeed against Russian aggression and to make sure the United States and our allies can replenish our own stocks of weapons to replace what we have sent to Ukraine. The President will underscore the role that the men and women who work at the facility in Alabama making these weapons have had on the fight in Ukraine.
The President will also highlight how important it is for Congress to move quickly to get the Bipartisan Innovation Act to his desk. Each Javelin missile requires more than 200 semiconductors to make. Boosting domestic chip manufacturing isn't just critical to making more in America or lowering prices—it's also a vital component of our national security. Passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act means America will stay on the cutting edge of new technologies, it means stronger, more resilient supply chains, and it means outcompeting the rest of the world for decades to come.

"Welcome President Biden" at the entrance to the Lockheed Martin complex itself.



May 3, 202214:28 CDT

WH travel pool 10 -- Javelin plant tour, motorcade back to Troy
The president took a tour of the newish Lockheed-Martin Javelin production plant, stopping at several work stations – each carrying labels like "Button 1," "Load Station 2" or "Gasline 1" – and spoke briefly to the techs, who explained what occurred at each stop.
The building had painted concrete floors, exposed piping, steel roofs, with some work stations equipped with heavy duty vent hoods.
The president took the tour sans mask, shaking hands and, as per usual, speaking so softly that it was difficult for pool to catch much of what he was saying.
"You realize how many lives you've saved," Biden told one woman. "Tell you what, you make a gigantic difference to the rest of the world.
Pool was led into a large factory floor that had been set up as an auditorium, with approximately 250 chairs arranged before a stage backed by a half dozen U.S. flags, stacked Javelin missile transport cases, and six missile launch tubes.
At 1402, Biden began his remarks from behind his lectern, a teleprompter screen off to either side.
"A lot of war crimes being committed."
"Those Javelins I saw, there are 10 for every tank. We're changing people's lives."
Said parents of newborns in Ukraine are naming them "Javelin" and "Javelinia"
"There's an ongoing battle in the world between autocracy and democracy."
Told his oft-repeated story about China's Xi telling him that democracies could not compete in the 21st century because they are too slow to move.
"You're allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves."
So far the U.S. has committed 5,500 Javelins to Ukraine, and more than $3 billion in military aid thus far
"That money is a direct investment in democracy and freedom itself."
Again lobbied for his $33 billion package to send more weapons to Ukraine as well as replenish diminished arsenal here.
Each Javelin contains 200 semiconductors, another reason to pass his proposal to increase production of computer chips in the US.
Biden wrapped up at 1419 after speaking about 15 minutes.
By 1425, we are back aboard the press vans and the motorcade is underway back toward Trump airfield.
