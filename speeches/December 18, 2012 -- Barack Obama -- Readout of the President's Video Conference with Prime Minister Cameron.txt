    The President and British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke today by video conference, as a part of their regular consultations on a range of strategic issues. The Prime Minister took the opportunity to personally express his condolences to the community of Newtown and the American people regarding the tragic violence at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The President thanked him for the support of the people of the United Kingdom at this difficult moment.
The two leaders expressed concern about the continuing violence in Syria. The President noted that the formation of the new Syrian Opposition Coalition marks an important step in preparing for a Syrian-led political transition, and reiterated the United States' firm stance regarding the use or proliferation of chemical weapons. The two leaders also discussed Afghanistan and our ongoing consultations with the Afghan Government, including negotiation of a U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement. They agreed on the need to find a way forward on Middle East peace that stops the cycle of counterproductive unilateral actions by the Israelis and Palestinians, and brings the parties back to the negotiating table. On Iran, the two leaders agreed on the need to continue implementing sanctions, which are having an important effect, while pursuing diplomatic engagement to resolve the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
