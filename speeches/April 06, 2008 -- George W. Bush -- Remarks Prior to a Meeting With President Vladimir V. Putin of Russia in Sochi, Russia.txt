    President Putin. Dear Mr. President, let me once again welcome you here in Sochi. I am very pleased that you've accepted this invitation. And I'm pleased that after the meeting in Bucharest, you now have the opportunity to discuss with me our bilateral relations and security issues.
Yesterday we actually started discussing those issues, and today we'll have to—we have the opportunity to discuss this in a calmer working manner. And on top of all, I am delighted to show you around Sochi, which will be the capital of the Olympic games in 2014.
Welcome, Mr. President.
President Bush. Thank you. I, first of all, was most grateful for the dinner that you gave last night. Secondly, thank you very much for providing fantastic entertainment. I'm only happy that our press corps didn't try—see me trying to dance the dance that I was asked to do. [Laughter]
President Putin. We were able to see that you are a brilliant dancer. [Laughter]
President Bush. Yes, well, thank you very much. We'll leave it at that, Mr. President. [Laughter]
I do want to—you know, it's going to be a very interesting meeting. This is the final meeting that we will have as Presidents of our respective countries. We have met a lot over the past years, and I've come to, you know, respect you. I respect the fact that you love your country. You've been a strong leader. You're not afraid to tell me what's on your mind. And when it's all said and done, we can shake hands.
And so I thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality here. Thank you, sir. Yes.
