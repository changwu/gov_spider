    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed the Executive Order on Strengthening National Resilience through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services, which directs the Federal Government to develop guidance that mitigates the risks of disruption to critical infrastructure that rely on PNT services. President Trump is committed to protecting and building a more resilient America. As the first nation to take this action, President Trump is advancing America's leadership in emerging technologies and securing infrastructure vital to national security, commercial industry, and our everyday lives. PNT service, such as U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), is among the most used utilities in the world. Americans rely on it every day for a variety of purposes ranging from electricity to smartphone applications. This action by the President will help to ensure that the United States maintains uninterrupted access to essential services that rely on PNT.
