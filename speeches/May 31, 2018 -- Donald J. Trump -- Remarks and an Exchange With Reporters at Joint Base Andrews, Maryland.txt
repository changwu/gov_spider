    The President. Good morning. I just want to tell you we're doing very well with North Korea. Our Secretary of State has had very good meetings. He's meeting again today. I believe they'll be coming down to Washington on Friday.
And a letter is going to be delivered to me from Kim Jong Un. So I look forward to seeing what's in the letter. But it's very important to them. So they'll be, probably, coming down to Washington, DC, on Friday for the delivery of a letter. I look forward to that.
Other than that, the economy is good. Stock market is up. Lot of jobs. Best unemployment we've had in many, many decades, actually. And we're going to Dallas. We're going to Houston. And we're going to have a little fun today.
Thank you very much.

Q. What's the letter going to say, sir?
The President. I don't know. I don't know. But if you know, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters], let me know.
Q. Is there some sort of deal? Is there a deal taking shape?
The President. I think it will be very positive. I think it will be very positive. The meetings have been very positive.
Q. Is an agreement taking shape?
The President. We'll see what happens. It's a process. It's all a process. We'll see. And hopefully, we'll have a meeting on the 12th. That's going along very well, but I want it to be meaningful. It doesn't mean it gets all done at one meeting; maybe you have to have a second or a third. And maybe we'll have none.
But it's in good hands, that I can tell you. You know that, actually. Thank you. Thank you.
