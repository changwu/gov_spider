    Today the Vice President dropped by a meeting with Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, and Director of the National Economic Council Gene Sperling and Governor Inslee of Washington, Governor Malloy of Connecticut, Governor O'Malley of Maryland, and Governor Quinn of Illinois to discuss the President's call to action on raising the minimum wage.
The Vice President reiterated the Administration's strong support of the efforts of these Governors to raise the minimum wage in their states. The Vice President stated that action from Congress is needed to make a difference nationwide, and boost the wages of millions of workers. Legislation before both the House and the Senate would raise America's minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The Vice President and the Administration look forward to continuing to work closely with Congress, Governors, businesses, and partners all across the country to give hardworking Americans a raise.
