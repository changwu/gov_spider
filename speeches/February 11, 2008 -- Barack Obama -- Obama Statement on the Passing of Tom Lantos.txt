    Chicago, IL - "Today, Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to Annette and the Lantos family, and we honor a truly extraordinary life in which Congressman Lantos never wavered in his defense of freedom and opposition to tyranny. Tom Lantos stood up to fascism and survived the Holocaust, and made it his life's work to advance human rights. For over two decades in the Congress, he was a champion for the Bay Area; a voice for all who are oppressed around the world; a staunch defender of Israel's security; and a talented and tireless advocate for effective foreign assistance. While he referred to himself as an 'American by choice,' his story - rising from the anti-Nazi underground of Hungary to the Chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Affairs - is a truly American story, and one that makes all of us proud," said Barack Obama.
