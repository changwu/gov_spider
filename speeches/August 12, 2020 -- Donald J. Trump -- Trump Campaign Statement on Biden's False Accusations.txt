"Throughout this campaign, Joe Biden has tried to paint President Trump as someone as he's not. Biden has falsely claimed that the President called white nationalists 'fine people,' but even the lamestream media has proven that's simply not true. In fact, President Trump has strongly condemned neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has built a solid foundation for Black America, ensuring that every individual has the ability to fulfill their God-given potential. With President Trump leading the nation, Black Americans can rest assured that they have a true fighter, a true advocate, and a true leader in the White House working on behalf of the Black community." â€“ Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor
