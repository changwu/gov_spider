    I was very pleased to learn today of the IRA's announcement that it has decided to allow a repeat inspection of a number of its arms dumps. This constitutes an important and timely confidence-building measure as part of a process initiated by the IRA aimed at putting its arms completely and verifiably beyond use. I welcome the IRA's statement that it has not broken off contact with the de Chastelain Commission, and I hope discussions with the Commission will resume at the earliest possible opportunity. I urge all parties to work together and in cooperation with the British and Irish Governments to build on the genuine progress that has already been achieved in implementing the Good Friday accord, by restoring momentum toward full implementation of all its provisions within the agreed timeframe.
