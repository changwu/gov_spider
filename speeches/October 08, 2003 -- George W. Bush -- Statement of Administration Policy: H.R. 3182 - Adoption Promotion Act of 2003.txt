    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Camp (R) MI and 8 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3182, which would reauthorize and amend the Adoption Incentives Program and implement the President's proposal to provide incentives to States to secure adoptions of older children. The Adoption Incentives Program, which provides incentives and rewards to States that increase the number of public adoptions, has been a tremendous success. However, more must be done to help the very large number of older children waiting to be adopted. H.R. 3182 would address this problem by providing greater incentives to States that increase the number of adoptions of children age nine and above. Enactment of this legislation would strengthen American families and encourage States' efforts to permanently place these children with secure and loving families.
