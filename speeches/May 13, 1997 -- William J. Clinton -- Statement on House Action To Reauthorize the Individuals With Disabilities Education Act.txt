    I am pleased that the House today took a major step toward ensuring high quality educational opportunities for all students with disabilities by voting to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). I am hopeful that the Senate will do the same shortly.
Over the last 20 years, the IDEA has made it possible for young people with disabilities to reach their full potential. This legislation strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to these children and their parents, and I look forward to signing it into law.
This legislation is the result of a bipartisan process that involved hard work not only by both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress but also by the Department of Education and representatives of the education and disability communities. I hope that we can continue in this bipartisan spirit and move forward on the rest of our agenda to improve education and prepare America for the 21st century.
