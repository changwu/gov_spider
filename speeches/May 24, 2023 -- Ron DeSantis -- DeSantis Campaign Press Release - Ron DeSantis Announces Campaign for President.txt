Governor DeSantis: "Our border is a disaster. Crime infests our cities. The federal government makes it harder for families to make ends meet. And the president flounders.
But decline is a choice. Success is attainable. And freedom is worth fighting for.
Righting the ship requires restoring sanity to our society, normalcy to our communities, and integrity to our institutions. Truth must be our foundation --- and common sense can no longer be an uncommon virtue. In Florida, we proved it can be done.
We chose facts over fear, education over indoctrination, law and order over rioting and disorder. We held the line when freedom hung in the balance.
We showed that we can --- and must --- revitalize America. We need the courage to lead and the strength to win.
I'm Ron DeSantis and I'm running for president to lead our great American comeback."
