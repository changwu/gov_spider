    I am signing today S. 1829, a bill which authorizes appropriations for the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) for fiscal years 1979 through 1983. The bill also provides PADC with other authorities that will facilitate carrying out the Pennsylvania Avenue development plan.
This action underscores my commitment to the preservation and enhancement of one of our Nation's most historic streets. I am confident that the cooperative efforts of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Congress, the government and people of the District of Columbia, and the American business community will result in the revitalization of this area and will demonstrate what can be achieved when the public and private sectors unite for a common purpose.
I am however concerned because the provisions of this bill establishing the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park would lead to unacceptable entanglements of the Federal Government in the operations of active churches. I have therefore directed Secretary Andrus to consider implementation of the portions of the bill relating to restoration and maintenance of the Missions only if they pass into secular ownership and use.
