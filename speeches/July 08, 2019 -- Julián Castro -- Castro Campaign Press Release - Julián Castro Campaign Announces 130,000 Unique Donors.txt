    SAN ANTONIO, TX (July 8, 2019) – On Monday, July 8, the presidential campaign of former U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary under President Obama and San Antonio Mayor, Julián Castro, announced that as of this morning it has received donations from 130,000 unique donors, a key qualification for the September and October Democratic Primary debates and a metric of grassroots support among voters.
"I'm grateful to all the people who have supported our campaign, helping us reach the first two debates," said Secretary Julián Castro. "As our message spreads, we gain more and more supporters. I'm going to keep working hard every day to share a positive vision for our future and show that I am the candidate who can beat Donald Trump."
Secretary Castro recently vaulted into the top five candidates following the first Democratic Primary debate, and is polling even with Mayor Pete Buttigieg in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, at 4 percent. Democratic National Committee requirements for participating in the September and October debates are at least 130,000 unique donors and polling above 2 percent in four qualifying polls since June 28. Secretary Castro has qualified in one poll so far. Additionally, the campaign has met the criteria of receiving 400 donations from at least 20 states.
Secretary Castro is on the second day of a swing through rural Iowa where he talked to a crowd of hundreds of people in Council Bluffs last night and is touring flood-damaged southwest Iowa today to hear from local residents. His campaign announced earlier today seven endorsements from local Iowa leaders.
