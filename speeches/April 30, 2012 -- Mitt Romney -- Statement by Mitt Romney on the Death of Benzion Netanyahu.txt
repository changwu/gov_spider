    Today, Mitt Romney released the following statement on the death of Benzion Netanyahu:
"I extend my sincere condolences to the family of Benzion Netanyahu. Not only was he the father of my friend Benjamin, the Prime Minister of Israel, and the father of Israel's hero of the Entebbe raid, Yonatan Netanyahu, he was also a distinguished historian and leader in his own right.Â  This is a loss for all of Israel and for all who care about Israel."
