  A Proclamation

1. Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, hereinafter referred to as the "TSUS", provides, in relevant part, as follows:
"(i) . . . if the President finds that a particular rate not lower than such January 1, 1968, rate, limited by a particular quota, may be established for any articles provided for in item 155.20 or 155.30, which will give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he shall proclaim such particular rate and such quota limitation,..."
"(ii) . . . any rate and quota limitation so established shall be modified if the President finds and proclaims that such modification is required or appropriate to give effect to the above considerations;..."
2. Headnote 2 was added to the TSUS by Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967 (82 Stat. 1455) to carry out a provision in the Geneva (1967) Protocol of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Note 1 of Unit A, Chapter 10, Part I of Schedule XX; 19 U.S.T., Part II, 1282). The Geneva Protocol is a trade agreement that was entered into and proclaimed pursuant to section 201(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a)). Section 201(a) of the Trade Expansion Act authorizes the President to proclaim the modification or continuance of any existing duty or other import restriction or such additional import restrictions as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of that Act.
3. I find that the modifications hereinafter proclaimed of the rates of duty applicable to items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS are appropriate to carry out a trade agreement and give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and pursuant to General Headnote 4 and Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim until otherwise superseded by law:
A. The rates of duty in rate columns 1 and 2 for items 155.20 and 155.30 of Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS are modified and the following rates are established:
155.20 2.98125¢ per lb. less 0.0421875¢
per lb. for each degree under 100 degrees (and fractions of a degree in proportion) but not less than 1.9265625¢ per lb.
155.30---------------------------------------- Dutiable on total sugars at the
rate per lb. applicable trader Item 155.20 to sugar testing 100 degrees.
B. Those parts of Proclamation 4334 of November 16, 1974, Proclamation 4463 of September 21, 1976, Proclamation 4466 of October 4, 1976, Proclamation 4539 of November 11, 1977, and Proclamation 4720 of February 1, 1980, which are inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (A) above are hereby terminated.
C. The provisions of this Proclamation shall apply to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption after 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the day following the date of this Proclamation. However, the provisions of this proclamation shall not apply to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to January 1, 1982 which are imported to fulfill forward contracts that were entered into prior to June 1, 1981 between: (a) an exporter and an end user of such articles; or (b) an importer, broker, or operator and an end user of such articles.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
