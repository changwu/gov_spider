    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 511(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended ("the Act"), 30 U.S.C. 958(a), I transmit herewith the annual report on mine safety and health activities for fiscal year 1992. This report was prepared by, and covers activities occurring exclusively during the previous Administration. The enclosed report does not reflect the policies or priorities of this Administration.
My Administration is committed to working with the Congress to ensure vigorous enforcement of existing mine safety and health standards. We are also intent on improving these rules where necessary and appropriate to better protect worker health and safety.
