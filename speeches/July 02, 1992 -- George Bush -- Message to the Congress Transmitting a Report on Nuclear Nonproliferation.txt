    To the Congress of the United States:
I have reviewed the activities of the United States Government departments and agencies during calendar year 1991 related to preventing nuclear proliferation, and I am pleased to submit my annual report pursuant to section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95 - 242, 22 U.S.C. 3281(a)).
As the report demonstrates, the United States continued its efforts during 1991 to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives to additional countries, one of my highest priorities. The events of the past year in Iraq and elsewhere underline the importance of these efforts to preserving our national security, by reducing the risk of war and increasing international stability. I am determined to build on the achievements discussed in this report and to work with the Congress toward our common goal: a safer and more secure future for all human kind.
George Bush
