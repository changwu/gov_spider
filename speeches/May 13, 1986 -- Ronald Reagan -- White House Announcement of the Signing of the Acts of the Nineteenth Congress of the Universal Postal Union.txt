    The President has signed the Acts of the Nineteenth Congress of the Universal Postal Union, negotiated at Hamburg in 1984, and expressed to the Postal Service Board of Governors and to the Postmaster General his concern that the Acts might be used in ways that would stifle private competition in the international mail arena.
Administration policy is to encourage free enterprise in ways that will ensure better products and services at lower costs to our citizens. In line with this policy, the President has asked the Postal Service Governors and the Postmaster General to permit and promote marketplace competition in international mail and to influence other nations to do likewise.
