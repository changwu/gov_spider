    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Evans (D) IL and 74 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3236, a bill dealing with the treatment for veterans exposed to radiation while in military service. The Administration, however, is concerned about the magnitude and feasibility of conducting the "radiation-risk activities" study specified in the bill. In addition, the Administration will work with the Senate to ensure that the pay-as-you-go costs of the bill are fully offset.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3236 would increase direct spending; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are still under development. If H.R. 3236 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effect of all enacted legislation on the pay-as-you-go requirement will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
