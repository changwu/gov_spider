    I welcome the observance of International Newspaper Carrier Day as an opportunity to commend those individuals throughout the country who deliver our newspapers.
As newspaper carriers you are an important link in the chain between publisher and reader. Your job helps millions of Americans to enjoy the convenience of home and office delivery every day.
Through your efficient and timely efforts, you help keep America informed and provide a vital service to our citizens.
