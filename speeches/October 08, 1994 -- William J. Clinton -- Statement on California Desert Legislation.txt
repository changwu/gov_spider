    Today's passage of the California desert bill is a clear-cut victory for the people of California and everyone across America who cares about this Nation's great natural heritage. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Dianne Feinstein for her tireless efforts to bring together a bipartisan coalition in Congress that ensured its passage.
The passage of this important environmental legislation is a testament to Dianne Feinstein's skillful leadership, perseverance, and determination to do the right thing for the people of California.
