    I have today signed H.R. 5892, the Wind Energy Systems Act of 1980, a bill authorizing a wind energy research, development, and demonstration program. The bill's purpose is to accelerate the widespread utilization of wind energy, which can play an important role in reaching the national goal I set last year of providing 20 percent of U.S. energy needs from solar and renewable sources by the year 2000. Senators Jackson and Matsunaga, Congressmen Mineta and Fuqua, and the numerous sponsors of this legislation are to be commended for their foresight in obtaining the enactment of H.R. 5892.
H.R. 5892 establishes specific objectives for wind-powered electric generating capacity and wind systems costs by 1988 and authorizes financial assistance, including Federal procurements of wind energy systems, to help achieve these ends. The bill also wisely permits discretion in selecting the types of financial assistance best suited to promoting the act's objectives. The Department of Energy will exercise this discretion to promote wind energy systems that are commercially viable and economically competitive. The Department will also seek significant cost-sharing from the private sector in order to reduce wind energy systems costs and to improve the prospects for commercialization.
My approval of H.R. 5892, along with my recent approval of tax credits for wind energy systems, clearly demonstrates this administration's continued commitment to renewable energy resources. The programs established by H.R. 5892 can make an important contribution to the administration ongoing wind energy program, and it is with pleasure that I sign this bill into law.
