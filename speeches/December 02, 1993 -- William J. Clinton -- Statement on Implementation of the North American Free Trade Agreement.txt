    I am delighted that, as a result of discussions following up on our meeting in Seattle, Canadian Prime Minister Chretien has announced his intention to proclaim the NAFTA by January 1, 1994. We look forward to the smooth and effective implementation of this historic agreement on January 1, so that all three countries can begin to reap the benefits of expanded trade, economic growth, and job creation in North America with the largest free trade area in the world.
