    Thank you all for the warm welcome. Welcome to Texas. Steve, thank you very much for inviting me. Mayor DuPuy, thank you very much for being such a gracious host for this important regional tournament. It's great to see you. I'm proud to be here, by the way, with the mayor of Crawford, Texas, Mayor David Posten. Mr. Mayor, it's good to see you. Laura and I are really thrilled to be here.
Before I say something about the families here, I do want to thank the Pride of the Blue, the Robinson High School Band, for being here.
I particularly want to say to the coaches of both teams: Thanks for setting such a good example. Thanks for taking time out of your lives to help these young men understand the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship and hard work.
To the families who are here: Thank you very much for supporting your Little Leaguer. Thanks for taking time out of your life to set such a good example for them and show them the love and compassion that is necessary.
And to the players, congratulations to you. You've worked hard to get here. Laura and I and Condi are looking forward to seeing a great game. We wish you all the very best.
Play hard. Play fair. Play to win. God bless you all, and may God continue to bless our great country. Thank you very much.
