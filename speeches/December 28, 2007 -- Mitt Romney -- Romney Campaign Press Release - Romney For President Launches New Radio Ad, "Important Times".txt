Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President launched its newest radio ad, "Important Times." The ad features Judge Robert Bork discussing why he is supporting Governor Mitt Romney for President of the United States. As President, Governor Romney will provide the strong leadership our country needs and he will appoint judges who interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. That is why Judge Bork is supporting Governor Romney.
The ad will begin airing today as part of the campaign's rotation in Iowa. Script and viewing link is below.
Script For "Important Times" (TV:30):
ANNOUNCER: "Robert Bork was Ronald Reagan's conservative nominee to the Supreme Court."
JUDGE ROBERT BORK: "Hello, this is Judge Robert Bork.
"These are very important times, and our next President will be called upon to make decisions on some big issues.
"The National Review endorsed Governor Romney, calling him a 'full-spectrum conservative.' I agree. Mitt Romney is the best person to unite the strong Reagan coalition of social, economic, and foreign policy conservatives.
"We need strong leadership on the economy, taxes, immigration, and foreign policy.
"And our next President may be called upon to make more than one Supreme Court nomination. Governor Romney will appoint judges who interpret the law, not activists who legislate from the bench.
"I admire that Governor Romney stood up to the activist court's ruling on legalizing same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. His strong leadership served as a model for the nation.
"This is Judge Robert Bork. I urge you to join me in supporting Mitt Romney for President."
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I'm Mitt Romney, and I approved this message."
