    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, as amended (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Fisheries Enforcement, signed at Ottawa on September 26, 1990. Under the Agreement, the United States and Canada agree to take measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels do not violate the fisheries laws of the other party. This Agreement will improve enforcement of U.S. fisheries laws in the U.S. exclusive economic zone and will reduce risks to human life and safety caused by fisheries enforcement incidents on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
