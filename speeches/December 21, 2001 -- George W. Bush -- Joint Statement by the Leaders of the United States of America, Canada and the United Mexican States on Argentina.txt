    Argentina is our neighbor and friend and we have witnessed recent events with concern and compassion. We hope that all Argentines can come together to find a solution that leads the country back to sustainable growth and prosperity. We applaud the great strength displayed by Argentina's institutions through this period, and reiterate our confidence in the country's standing as one of the Western Hemisphere's leading democracies.
