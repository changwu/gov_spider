    I join in sorrow as Americans everywhere mourn the death of your husband.
Dedicated to America and dynamic in his service to her interests, Louis Johnson brought the distinction of accomplishment to his public trust.
His energy and ability were reflected throughout both his government and his private career. The awesome responsibility which was his both in the office of Secretary of Defense and in his other official duties testifies to the respect and confidence of his associates.
His loyalty and devotion to our Democratic Party will always be a source of inspiration to all who espouse its high ideals and labor toward their fulfillment.
Lady Bird and I want to express our deepest sympathy to you and to your family. Our thoughts are with you, and we pray that you may find comfort in God's abundant blessings throughout this sad and difficult time.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Louis A. Johnson, 317 Buckhannon Avenue, Clarksburg, West Virginia]
