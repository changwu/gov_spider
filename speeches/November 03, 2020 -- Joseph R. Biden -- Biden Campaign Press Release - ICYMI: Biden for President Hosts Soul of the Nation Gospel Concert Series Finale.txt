    On Sunday November 1, Biden for President hosted the finale in the Soul of the Nation Gospel Concert series, which included seven concerts over the course of the campaign. The event featured elected officials and faith leaders across the country, all joining to unite behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the final GOTV marathon.
The concert finale featured Erica Campbell, Israel Houghton, MAJOR., VaShawn Mitchell, Bishop William Murphy III, Kathy Taylor, Hezekiah Walker, Juan and Lisa Winans, and Brian Courtney Wilson, as well as performances from Keedron Bryant, Milwaukee Marshall High School, and the Virginia State University Gospel Chorale.
Over the course of the series, the Soul of the Nation Gospel concerts built incredible momentum for the Biden-Harris campaign, gaining more followers throughout the season. Each week, speakers reinforced the importance of voting early and recruiting families and friends to vote, and shared how to get involved with the Biden-Harris campaign during the final days.
"The importance of this evening is to bring people of faith together in a world that needs unity. Now more than ever, there must be a concerted effort to get the vote out on November 3. We are in the midst of a global pandemic with America leading in the number of citizens infected and more than 200,000 dead of COVID-19. There is currently no plan by the current administration to halt or even curb the virus," said Congresswoman Marcia Fudge.
