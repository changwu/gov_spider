    Today I join millions of Americans in the commemoration of the contributions that Mexican Americans make every day to our great country. And I pay tribute to the rich history of the Mexican people.
Cinco de Mayo marks the anniversary of the historic victory of the Mexican people over the French army during the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. This day of pride, joy and celebration for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans has been embraced by people of all backgrounds as a tribute to our deep historical, cultural and economic ties to Mexico.
For the past seven years, we have had a president whose policies have been one of neglect and broken promises towards our neighbors to the south. Today not only marks an opportunity to recognize the many ways in which Mexican-Americans enrich our country with their culture and their contributions, but also an opportunity to recognize that we do indeed share common goals and challenges -- including addressing the needs of working families and fighting growing inequality, safeguarding democracy, and securing our borders.
As president, I have four priorities for our hemisphere. First, my administration will work closely with our partners in the region to encourage effective democratic governance, the rule of law, and personal security for their citizens. Second, I am committed to helping to address the growing economic nequality within the nations of the Americas through expanded opportunity. Third, I will work with our neighbors to address the shared challenges of limate change and energy security. Fourth, I will work to enact comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rule of law, our immigrant heritage, and our values.
So as we celebrate all across the United States today, let us not forget that Cinco de Mayo is a day to appreciate and celebrate the diversity that makes America a stronger nation.
