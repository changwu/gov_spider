    I am delighted that Israel and Jordan have reached agreement on the text of their peace treaty. Earlier today, I spoke with King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin. I congratulated them on their historic achievement and on their courage and persistence in getting there. I assured them that the United States will continue to stand with them in the days ahead and to support this peace process as we have all along.
These leaders have decided that from now on they will live in peace as neighbors. They have decided that they want to be friends. And their friendship and their peace is clearly welcomed by the friends of peace throughout the world. At a time when hatred and extremism and threatening behavior still stalk the Middle East, this is a clear signal that there can be a different future. This agreement reminds us that moderation and reason can and will prevail in the Middle East, that nations can put conflict behind them, that statesmen can lead people to peace.
On behalf of the American people, I want to say a profound word of thanks and congratulations to both King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin, and especially to the people of Israel and the people of Jordan.
