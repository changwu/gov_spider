    "Bill Clinton today started down the right path at last By answering four specific questions, the Clinton White House proved it has access to full information about the President's health, but an even more significant question remains: Why won't the President of the United States provide the American people with a full accounting of his medical history and records?"
"Clinton aides are often credited with staging events to demonstrate Bill Clinton's youth and vigor. Those campaign tactics are fine -- but they carry a whiff of hypocrisy when Bill Clinton refuses to meet the same standards for full disclosure that every other President has provided in recent years.
"Every American hopes every President has nothing to hide about health. But each American also has the right to demand that Candidate Clinton be held to the same high standard of full disclosure about health as Candidate Dole. After all 'as Bill Clinton's White House has proven time and again, partial disclosure is no disclosure at all."
