    The Houston Chronicle has also announced they are endorsing Jeb Bush for President, stating that Jeb "outshines GOP field with solid conservative bonafides and pragmatism."
"Bush is deeply conservative, to be sure, but he's also a pragmatist who at least will negotiate with his opponents toward a common end...he understands the issues, has experience both as a businessman and an elected official and is a decent man."
Also, the San Antonio Express-News endorsed Jeb. See their endorsement below:
"Having served two successful terms as Florida governor, Bush brings strong executive experience to the table, and he is as thoroughly prepared to hold the nation's top job as anyone in the race. Bush's combination of credentials and sober problem-solving leadership makes him the right candidate for the Republican presidential nomination."
