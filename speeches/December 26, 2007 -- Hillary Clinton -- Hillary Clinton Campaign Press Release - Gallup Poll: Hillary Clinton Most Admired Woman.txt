    For 6th Straight Year, Hillary Is Named Most Admired Worldwide
For the sixth consecutive year, Hillary Clinton was named the most admired woman in the world in a Gallup poll released today. She was picked by 18 percent of respondents, her highest standing since 2000.
"Americans know Hillary has been fighting for children and families for 35 years," said Clinton Campaign Manager Patti Solis Doyle. "They admire her commitment and strength to make change."
It was the 12th time Clinton has been named the most admired woman in the world. She has finished first or second in each of the last 15 years.
Gallup has asked the most admired man and woman questions in all but two years since 1948.
