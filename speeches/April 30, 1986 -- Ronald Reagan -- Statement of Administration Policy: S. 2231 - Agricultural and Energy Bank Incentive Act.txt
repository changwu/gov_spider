    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Gam (R) Utah)
The Administration opposes S. 2231, because:

A moratorium on non-bank banks is unnecessary, would threaten the legal status of some existing banks, would undermine the well-established structure of unitary thrift holding companies, and would discourage those who wish to provide new services to consumers; and
Statutory assistance to agricultural and energy banks is unnecessary in light of administrative actions already undertaken by the regulatory agencies.
