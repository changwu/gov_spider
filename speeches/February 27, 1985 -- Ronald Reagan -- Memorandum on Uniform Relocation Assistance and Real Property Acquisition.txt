Within one year of the date of this Memorandum, such departments and agencies shall issue common regulations under the Act. Such regulations shall be consistent with the model policy promulgated by DOT, in consultation and coordination with other affected agencies, and published in final form in the Federal Register simultaneously with this Memorandum.
5. DOT shall report annually to the President's Council on Management Improvement, through the Office of Management and Budget, on implementation of the Act.
