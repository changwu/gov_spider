Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I appreciate very much your letter of August 7 informing me of King Leopold's forthcoming trip to the United States for the purpose of visiting various installations connected with the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Admiral Strauss, who has been a friend of the King for many years, has been informed about the King's plans and is looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to the effectiveness of his visit. In making initial plans for the visit I would suggest that it might be useful for you to provide Ambassador Folger with a general statement of King Leopold's interests and projected itinerary. After his arrival in the United States, the King will doubtless wish to establish with Admiral Strauss a precise itinerary to satisfy his interests.
You may be assured of our interest in the King's visit and our hope that it will prove to be successful.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
