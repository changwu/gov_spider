    I am profoundly saddened by the terrible loss of life in the train fire in Al-Avyat. This tragedy is all the more horrible because it took place during the holiday of Eid al-Adha. Laura and I and all of the American people offer our deepest sympathy and condolences to President Mubarak, the Egyptian people, and especially to those families who have lost loved ones.
