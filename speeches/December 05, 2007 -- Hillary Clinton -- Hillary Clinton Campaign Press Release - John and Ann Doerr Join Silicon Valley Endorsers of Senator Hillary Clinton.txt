    Venture capitalist John Doerr and environmental advocate Ann Doerr today announced their support of Hillary Clinton for President. In announcing their support, the Doerrs said they have chosen to endorse Clinton because of her experience and vision for the future.
"We face many complex policy challenges in this country and abroad. From healthcare to national security, Hillary 'gets it'. We have enormous respect for Hillary's forward-looking agenda in energy, innovation, healthcare and the economy. She has the experience, judgment and leadership to strengthen America's standing in the world. One of the greatest challenges facing Americans and the world is sound energy policy, particularly addressing global warming. Hillary will assemble a world-class team to tackle these incredibly important issues, and we are pleased to support her."
Ann and John care deeply about:

Green technology innovation and policies to help solve global warming;

Public education; and

Global solutions to poverty and health, including micro-lending, smart aid programs for Africa, and breakthroughs to fight AIDs, malaria, pandemic flu and other infectious disease.
