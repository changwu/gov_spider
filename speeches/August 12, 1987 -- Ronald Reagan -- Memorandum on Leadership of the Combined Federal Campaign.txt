    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
We see the promise of our great Nation exemplified in our Constitution whose bicentennial we celebrate this year. The 1987-88 Combined Federal Campaign gives us the opportunity to help others achieve the full promise of America through our voluntary giving. It is important that each of us take visible leadership roles in the Campaigns in our agencies.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Otis R. Bowen has agreed to serve as Chairman of the 1987-88 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I am asking that you support Secretary Bowen by personally serving as Chairman of the Campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Secretary Bowen of your willingness to serve and the name of the person you designate.
The single most important ingredient in making the Combined Federal Campaign a success is the active involvement of top leadership. Consequently, your personal interest, visible support, and participation are essential. Thousands of Federal employees participate, but many others remain on the sidelines. Make a special effort to encourage all of your employees, both in the Washington area and in all the CFC locations worldwide, to support the Campaign.
With your leadership, we can make this fall's campaign a resounding success.
RONALD REAGAN
