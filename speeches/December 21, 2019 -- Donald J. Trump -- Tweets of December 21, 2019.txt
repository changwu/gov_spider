Last year I signed legislation that gives our Veterans CHOICE through private providers and at urgent care facilities! Today we fully funded this $10 billion a year effort that gets our brave Veterans care quickly and close to home.Retweets: 18389Favorites: 85024

We will always provide for our Veterans and their mental health. I pushed Congress to provide $10 Billion for Vet mental health suicide prevention outreach and funding for my PREVENTS Initiative to end Vet suicide. Congress responded. A big win for our Vets!Retweets: 15265Favorites: 63830

Honored to finally put an end to the 'Widow's Tax' and ensure that our surviving military spouses receive their full benefits. The spouses and families of our fallen heroes have suffered enough and WE must do everything in our power to ease the burden.Retweets: 28689Favorites: 126554

My Administration pushed to include a big expansion to Veteran telehealth in the spending bill so that the brave men and women who served our Country get the care they need. #RuralProsperityRetweets: 11373Favorites: 49209

Proud of @JimInhofe's tenacious Oklahoma spirit that got the NDAA done. Maybe the best yet because it takes care of troops & establishes SPACE FORCE which is 1st new branch since 1947 (Air Force). Another huge win for Jim's legacy. To many more! @SASCMajority https://t.co/w0EiubrriGRetweets: 7366Favorites: 29057

Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever. The very vital Space Force was created. New planes ships missiles rockets and equipment of every kind and all made right here in the USA. Additionally we got Border Wall (being built) funding. Nice!Retweets: 32964Favorites: 166188
