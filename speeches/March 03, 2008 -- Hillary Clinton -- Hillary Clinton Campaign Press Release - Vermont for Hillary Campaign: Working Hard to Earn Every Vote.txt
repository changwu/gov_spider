    Over the past days, the Vermont for Hillary campaign has stepped up its efforts across the Green Mountain State. From grassroots activities, to visits from top supporters and a member of the Clinton family, the campaign has been working hard to make sure that Vermont voters know that Hillary Clinton is the one candidate with real solutions to solve America's problems.
Hundreds of volunteers - including Pixie Loomis of Hyde Park, who went to Wellesley with Hillary and was in attendance when she delivered her graduation speech in June 1969 and Patrick McElhiney, a student at McIntosh College in Dover, New Hampshire who volunteered in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine, before taking two weeks off to volunteer fulltime in Vermont - have contributed countless hours to helping Hillary make history. They've made thousands of phone calls to their friends and neighbors and braved the cold weather to attend dozens of visibilities.
The campaign's co-chairs, former Governor Madeleine Kunin and Speaker Gaye Symington have been aided in their efforts to share Senator Clinton's message with voters across the state by visits from former EPA Administrator Carol Browner and human rights activist Kerry Kennedy.
On Friday, Chelsea Clinton campaigned in Burlington - greeting voters on Church Street and attending an "Our Voices, Our Future," event at the University of Vermont. Over 800 students and community members had the opportunity to see Chelsea and ask her about the issues that matter most to them in the election.
Energized by the momentum on the ground, volunteers, supporters and staff will spend the next 24 hours focusing on aggressive Get Out of the Vote efforts in all corners of the Green Mountain State. They'll continue making phone calls, attending visibilities, visiting voting locations and asking their friends and neighbors to join Hillary until the polls close tomorrow night.
