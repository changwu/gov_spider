    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (hereinafter the "Act"), requires that the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, as described in that section, shall remain in effect until changed by law. Section 1511(e) of the Act authorizes the President to waive or modify the application of such sanctions upon certification to the Congress that the President has determined that the waiver or modification is necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to the parties.
In accordance with this provision, I have issued the attached Presidential Determination stating that the suspension of the sanctions described in section 1511(a) (1-5) and (7-8) and in conformity with the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1021 and 1022 is necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict. As described in the attached Memorandum of Justification, this sanctions relief was an essential factor motivating Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995 (hereinafter the "Peace Agreement").
I have directed the Secretaries of the Treasury and Transportation to suspend immediately the application of these sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro and have authorized the Secretary of State to suspend the arms embargo at appropriate stages consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1021. The first stage would be 91 days after the United Nations Secretary General reports to the United Nations Security Council that all parties have formally signed the Peace Agreement.
The measures taken to suspend these sanctions may be revoked if the Implementation Force (IFOR) commander or High Representative determines that Serbia and Montenegro or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting their obligations under the Peace Agreement.
