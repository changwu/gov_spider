    Quito, Ecuador—Second Lady Karen Pence helped to reconnect a sister city relationship between Quito and Coral Gables, Florida by initiating a cultural exchange between the two cities during her visit in Quito. Mrs. Pence met with Quito Mayor, Dr. Mauricio Rodas and presented him with a letter and two books from the Mayor of Coral Gables. The books are about Coral Gables, Florida. In exchange, Mayor Rodas presented Mrs. Pence with a wooden plaque with tiles that represent the city of Quito to give to the Mayor of Coral Gables. Mrs. Rocío González de Moreno, First Lady of Ecuador and María Fernanda Pacheco, the Mayor's wife were also present for the gift exchange.
"As the Honorary Vice Chair of Sister Cities International, I am honored to participate in this cultural exchange, which allows citizens to gain invaluable insight into another country's history, culture, and values while sharing their own," said Mrs. Karen Pence. "Our hope is that through the gift exchange between Quito and Coral Gables, we are building a better and stronger relationship between the two cities."
Upon return to Washington, D.C., Mrs. Pence will complete the cultural exchange by sending the gift from Quito to Coral Gables, Florida.
