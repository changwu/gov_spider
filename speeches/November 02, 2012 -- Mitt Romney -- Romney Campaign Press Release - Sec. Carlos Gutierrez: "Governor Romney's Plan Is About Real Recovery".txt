    Former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez today made the following statement on the October unemployment report:
"Today's jobs report is a sobering reminder that our country is in dire need of a real economic recovery. With 2.3 million more Hispanics living in poverty since the President took office, and Hispanic unemployment at a dismal 10 percent, we cannot sustain another four years of Obama's failed economic policies. We need a leader like Mitt Romney, with the proven experience to help the 23 million Americans who can't find good jobs. On day one in the White House, Mitt Romney will put in place a plan that will create 12 million jobs in his first term. He will do so by championing small business, cutting spending to bring down the deficit, moving us toward energy independence, making sure that American workers have the tools they need to succeed, and expanding trade with Latin America. Governor Romney's campaign is about a real recovery, which is exactly what we need."
