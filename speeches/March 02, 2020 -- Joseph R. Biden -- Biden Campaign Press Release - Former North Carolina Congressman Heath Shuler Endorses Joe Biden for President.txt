"Today, I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for President. Joe not only has what it takes to beat Donald Trump, but he has a track record of getting things done. On day one, Joe will restore our place on the world stage and bring much needed dignity and leadership back to the Oval Office. There has never been a more critical time to unify our country. Through his time in the Senate and his time as Vice President to President Obama, Joe Biden has proven that he can work across the aisle to make real change."
