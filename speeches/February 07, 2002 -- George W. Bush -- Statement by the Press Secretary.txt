    The President will travel to Lima, Peru on March 23 and to San Salvador, El Salvador on March 24.
Peruvians over the last year have reaffirmed strongly their commitment to democratic principles, and have shown leadership in promoting these principles throughout the Inter-American region. In Peru, the President will meet with President Toledo to discuss our mutual efforts to strengthen hemispheric democracy, free trade, and the rule of law. They will also discuss our common fight against narcotics trafficking and terrorism.
In El Salvador, the President will discuss with President Flores the proposed initiative on a Central American Free Trade Agreement. The two leaders will also discuss U.S. support for El Salvador's ongoing efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and to modernize its economy, and will review U.S. assistance programs for earthquake reconstruction.
