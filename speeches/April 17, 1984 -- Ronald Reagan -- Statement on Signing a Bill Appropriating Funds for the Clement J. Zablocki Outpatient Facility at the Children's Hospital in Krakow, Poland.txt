    I am pleased to sign H.R. 4835, a bill authorizing the appropriation of $10 million dedicated to the equipping and furnishing of the Clement J. Zablocki Outpatient Facility at the Children's Hospital in Krakow, Poland, as well as the provision of medical supplies to the people of Poland. This is a fitting tribute to a man who meant so much to the people of both the United States and Poland.
