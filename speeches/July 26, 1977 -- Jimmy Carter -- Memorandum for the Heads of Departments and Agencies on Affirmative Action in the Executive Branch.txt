    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Subject: Affirmative Action
Last March I wrote to each of you concerning my commitment to affirmative action in the Executive Branch. I indicated that at some future time I would expect progress reports on affirmative action from the executive departments and agencies.
I have directed the Presidential Personnel Office at the White House to assume responsibility for monitoring progress on affirmative action hiring for noncareer positions throughout the Executive Branch.
The Presidential Personnel Office will be briefing each department or agency on the reporting procedures which have been established. If you have other ideas as to how affirmative action might be strengthened, please send them to me through the Presidential Personnel Office.
JIMMY CARTER
