    American workers and workers around the world owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Lane Kirkland. For nearly five decades, he has been a catalyst for international democracy and a guiding force for workplace fairness, dignity, and innovation.
His record of achievement rivals the great labor leaders that came before him, and his ideas and accomplishments will benefit working families for generations to come. He served with distinction during some of the toughest times for American workers and brought creativity, a laser-like determination, true grit, and an unparalleled intellect to his job as president of the AFL-CIO.
Hillary and I wish him the very best for the future and will always be grateful for his strong support, keen advice, and valued friendship.
