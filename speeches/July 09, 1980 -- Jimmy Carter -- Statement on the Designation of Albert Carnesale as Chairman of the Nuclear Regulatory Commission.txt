    The Three Mile Island accident and the Kemeny Commission report have underlined the need for strong, concerned leadership at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I am appointing Dr. Carnesale because I know he can and will provide that kind of leadership. I also know that he will be especially sensitive to the overriding importance of safety and environmental protection in the development of our nuclear power resources.
I am confident that under Dr. Carnesal's direction, the NRC will work to enhance its efforts to ensure that the Kemeny Commission recommendations are fully implemented and that public safety and health are protected in our Nation's nuclear powerplants.
