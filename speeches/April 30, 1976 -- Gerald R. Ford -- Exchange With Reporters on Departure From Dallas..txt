    REPORTER. How essential is the Texas primary to you?
THE PRESIDENT. It's a very crucial primary. It's a wonderful State. It's one of our largest States. It has got a wide diversity of people and industry. So, it's a great reflection of the United States as a whole. So, we are trying our very best to win, and we are, I think, making a lot of headway.
Q. Some people have said that the closing of air bases and several other things relative to military matters in Texas have hurt you. Do you feel that's so?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think so because most of the people understand that the Congress has imposed on us by substantially reducing the funds for the military. So, the blame fundamentally falls on the shoulders of Congress.
It's nice to see you all. Thank you very much. We have enjoyed being here in Dallas.
Q. Do you think you are going to win in Texas?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we are getting more and more optimistic, and our volunteers have done a great job all over the State of Texas. And leadership with Senator Tower has been extremely helpful. And I think we have made tremendous progress, and we are very encouraged.
Q. Are you going to win?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's getting closer and closer. It's a good contest and I'm always optimistic.
Thank you very, very much.
