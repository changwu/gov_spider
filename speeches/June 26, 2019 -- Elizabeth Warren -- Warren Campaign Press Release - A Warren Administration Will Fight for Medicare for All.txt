    Charlestown, MA - At the NBC Democratic Debate tonight, Elizabeth Warren talked about her support for Medicare for All.
Elizabeth believes Medicare for All should be the law of the land. She is a co-sponsor of the Medicare for All legislation in the United States Senate and supports the push for Medicare for All legislation in Massachusetts.
Elizabeth has spent her whole career studying why families go broke. She came to find that one of the top reasons for that is medical problems -- even for families with insurance.
Private insurance companies raked in $23 billion last year while premiums skyrocket and prescription drug copays are going through the roof. Elizabeth fights for Medicare for All because she believes every person should be able to get the health care they need instead of fighting with insurance companies.
Enough of rich insurance executives calling the shots in Washington. Health care is a basic human right and a Warren administration will fight for basic human rights.
