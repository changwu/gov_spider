    Today, President Donald J. Trump took historic action to protect the American automobile industry, its workforce, and American innovation. Following an extensive review of the Department of Commerce's Section 232 automobile report, President Trump today issued a proclamation directing the United States Trade Representative to negotiate agreements to address the national security threat, which is causing harm to the American automobile industry. The Department of Commerce report, delivered to the President on February 17, 2019, concluded that imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts threaten to impair the national security of the United States. United States defense and military superiority depend on the competitiveness of our automobile industry and the research and development that industry generates. The negotiation process will be led by United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and, if agreements are not reached within 180 days, the President will determine whether and what further action needs to be taken.
