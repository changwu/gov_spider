    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of seven Alabama community leaders from across the state.
"Hillary is ready to lead on her first day in the White House and immediately begin delivering the change this country needs," said Commissioner of Agriculture Ron Sparks.
"Hillary is passionate about helping people, it's at the root of who she is," said Jefferson County Commissioner Shelia Smoot. "She doesn't change with the wind, she's always working on our behalf to make a difference. America will be a better place with Hillary as our President."
"I am grateful for the overwhelming support I've received in Alabama," Clinton said. "With the help of these local leaders, we'll take our message of change across the state and this nation."
