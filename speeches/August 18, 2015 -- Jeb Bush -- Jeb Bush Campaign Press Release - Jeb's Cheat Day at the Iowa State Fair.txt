    Friday, August 14, Governor Jeb Bush spent his morning at the Iowa State Fair. Arriving at 8 a.m., he toured the fairgrounds, engaging with Senators Charles E. Grassley and Joni Ernst, grilling in his new Iowa Pork Producers Association BBQ Apron, and eating a fried Snickers.
Taking the stage at the DMR Soapbox, Jeb reiterated his vision of restoring the right to rise in America. As the former Governor of a "purple state," Jeb stated that he "campaign[s] the way that [he] would govern, out amongst everybody, no rope lines." After taking questions from the crowd, Jeb distributed his email address so Iowans can stay in contact with him.
All in all, a great day at the fair.
