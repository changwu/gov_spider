    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
REVISION
(Senate)(Ackerman (D) NY)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3981 if it contains the amendment expected to be offered on the Senate floor that would allow certain Federal employees to get larger Civil Service Retirement annuities by counting their previous private sector employment in the railroad industry as Federal employment. These former railroad employees are no different from thousands of other Federal employees who cannot count their previous private sector service to enlarge their Federal annuities. Giving private sector service credit to these employees would provide them with unforeseen and costly windfall benefits and would establish a bad precedent for giving enlarged Federal employee annuities based on private sector employment.
