Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney named the Romney for President Iowa Business Coalition. Led by Statewide Chair Jamie Myers and County Chairs in 20 counties across the state, this group of business leaders will work to ensure Iowa voters know that Governor Romney is the candidate who has put forth strong pro-growth economic policies and will bring real change to Washington.
"Business leaders across the state of Iowa and throughout the nation understand the need to meet this generation's economic challenges. They understand that their businesses will thrive in a climate of low taxes and less government regulation. Most importantly, they understand that we need a conservative change in Washington to address these challenges. I look forward to working with these business leaders to promote our plan for a stronger economy," said Governor Romney.
Leading this group, Chair and Regency Companies President Jamie Myers said, "Governor Romney is a proven leader with a proven record of transformation. He transformed companies into thriving businesses, a debt-ridden Olympics into a remarkable success, and a budget deficit into a balanced budget without raising taxes or borrowing more money. Governor Romney has the experience and know-how to make positive, conservative change in Washington."
