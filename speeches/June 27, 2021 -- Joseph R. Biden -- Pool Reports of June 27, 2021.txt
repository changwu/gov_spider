In-town pool report #2 — POTUS lands / lid 
Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 7:08 p.m.
POTUS, wearing a navy suit and no tie, stepped off a few moments later with FLOTUS, in a navy patterned dress, sunglasses and a white sweater over her shoulders, just behind him. They walked holding hands across the lawn.
As he passed the press behind the rope line, POTUS smiled back at shouted questions on Syria and infrastructure but his brief response — he didn't stop — was not audible. It seemed he said something about "tomorrow."
POTUS and FLOTUS entered the White House residence at 7:11.
We have a travel/photo lid at 7:13.
