    California Board of Equalization Chairwoman says Edwards is the best candidate to lead country and take back the White House
San Francisco, California â€“ Senator John Edwards visited California today, receiving the endorsement of California Board of Equalization Chairwoman Betty Yee, who has been helping the campaign since late July. Chairwoman Yee publicly announced her support today at a fundraiser she hosted for Edwards in San Francisco.
"I support John because he has the boldest, most detailed policies to move this country forward," said Yee. "Whether it is ending the war in Iraq, providing truly universal healthcare, fighting global warming, ending poverty or enacting comprehensive immigration reform, John has set himself apart from the other candidates. I believe he is the best candidate to lead our country and the best chance Democrats have at taking back the White House."
Yee has spent more than 20 years in public service, focusing on state and local finance and infrastructure. She has served as the Chief Deputy Director for Budget at the California Department of Finance, as senior staff in policy and fiscal committees in the California State Senate and State Assembly, and as a county public health commissioner. She has also been a tireless advocate and community leader for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
"Betty's commitment to advocating for those who have no voice is an example of what we all should be doing to build a better America," said Edwards. "I am honored to have her support and look forward to working with her to change our country, so every American has the opportunity to work hard and succeed."
