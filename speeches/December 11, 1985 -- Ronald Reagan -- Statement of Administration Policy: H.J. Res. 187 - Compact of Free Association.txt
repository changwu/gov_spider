    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Udall (D) Arizona and Fascell (D) Florida)
The Administration urges prompt House enactment of H.J. Res. 187, if it is modified by the comprehensive amendment encompassing agreements reached between the House and Senate managers, the representatives of the freely associated States, and the Administration.
The comprehensive amendment would modify the Senate-passed resolution to (1) reduce the amount of compensation to the Micronesians for the loss of investment incentives included in the negotiated compact to $30 million, the highest figure the Administration could accept, and (2) clarify the language regarding Federal implementation of the Compact.
