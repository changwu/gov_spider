    "President Obama is trying to run on Bill Clinton's record because, after three and a half years in office, middle-class Americans aren't better off under his leadership. Jobs and incomes have declined, while the nation's debt and deficits are up. As inconvenient as it might be for President Obama, it's time for him to run on his own record, not the record he wished he had." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

And the annual growth rate for the U.S. economy in the January-March quarter was unchanged at a tepid 1.9 percent. ... Growth of around 1.9 percent typically generates roughly 90,000 jobs a month. That's considered too weak to lower the unemployment rate, which was 8.2 percent last month." (Christopher S. Rugaber, "Tepid Economic Growth Weighs On US Job Market," The Associated Press, 6/28/12)
