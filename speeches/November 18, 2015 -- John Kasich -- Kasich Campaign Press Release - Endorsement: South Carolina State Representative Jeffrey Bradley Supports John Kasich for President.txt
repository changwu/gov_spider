    South Carolina State Representative Jeffrey Bradley today endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President and joined Kasich for America's South Carolina Leadership Team as a state co-chair.
"I decided to endorse Governor Kasich for president after hearing his remarks last week at the town hall hosted by U.S. Senator Tim Scott," said Bradley, who is a longtime resident of Hilton Head, South Carolina, where the event took place. "His ideas for balancing the federal budget, rebuilding our military, and encouraging job creation are exactly what America needs right now. His response to the attacks in Paris only confirmed my belief that he is the right person for the job. He has the national security policy experience and vision to be a strong Commander in Chief and keep our country safe.
State Representative Jeffrey Bradley represents South Carolina State District 123, which includes portions of Beaufort County. Bradley has resided in Hilton Head for over 35 years, where he works as a financial adviser. He serves on the boards of numerous civic associations in Hilton Head, including the Community Foundation of the Lowcountry, Technical College of the Lowcountry Foundation, South Carolina Commission on Higher Education, and the KNOW2 Beaufort pilot program.
Said Kasich, "I am thrilled to welcome State Representative Jeffrey Bradley to our South Carolina team. As a leader in his community and a leader in the Lowcountry, he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to our efforts. Our team is growing stronger by the day, and I'm humbled by the groundswell of support from around the state."
State Senator Ray Cleary and State Representative Gary Clary also serve as co-chairs.
