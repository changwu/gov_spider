    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Aruba to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Program, effective January 1, 1986.
Aruba will become independent of the Netherlands Antilles on January 1, 1986. The Netherlands Antilles is a GSP Beneficiary and this designation will permit Aruba to continue to receive GSP benefits after it becomes independent.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
