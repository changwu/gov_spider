Ms. Monaco emphasized our solidarity with the United Kingdom and other European partners in the fight against violent extremism and discussed domestic and international countering violent extremism programs.
Noting that the United Kingdom is one of our strongest partners in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, Ms. Monaco discussed a number of ways we can continue to enhance our respective whole-of-government efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL, including targeted efforts to interdict foreign fighter transit.
