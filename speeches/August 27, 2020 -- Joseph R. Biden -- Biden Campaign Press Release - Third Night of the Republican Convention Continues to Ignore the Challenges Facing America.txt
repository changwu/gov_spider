    In response to the third night of the Republican Convention, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"What wasn't said tonight tells us far more than what was: barely a mention of the virus killing thousands of Americans each week, no real discussion of the crushing financial hardship countless families are facing as a result, and no plan to get us out of the ditch that Donald Trump has driven us into. We also heard almost nothing about the massive hurricane bearing down on the Gulf Coast.
"Instead of a roadmap to defeat this virus and rebuild our economy so that it works for the middle class, Vice President Pence only offered up debunked scare tactics and gaslighting in an attempt to further divide us.
"Donald Trump called himself a wartime President, but instead of rallying the country in the fight against the single greatest challenge facing our nation, he and Mike Pence are waving the white flag of defeat, betting everything on the pandemic simply 'disappearing' â€” all while trying to tear our nation apart. The American people cannot afford to wait any longer for this administration to finally take this threat seriously.
"Every day that we wait for this administration to show leadership is another day that Americans will continue to die from this virus, another day where our economy remains shuttered, and another day where our children cannot go back to school."
