    Today Kasich for America announced Ohio Gov. John Kasich's leadership team in Connecticut prior to the state's April 26th primary election.
Under the chairmanship of State Senator Tony Hwang, who endorsed Gov. Kasich last month, the team includes a number of prominent former and current public officials from around the state.Â 
Said Hwang, "I'm looking forward to working with these colleagues and friends to engage Connecticut voters on behalf of Gov. Kasich. His brand of commonsense, results-oriented conservatism is resonating, as is the message that only John Kasich can defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall."

"It's exciting to see our team in Connecticut expand," said Kasich. "I'm grateful to Tony Hwang and every other leader who's come on board for their willingness to share our message of results in their communities."
