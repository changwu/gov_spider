    President Bush and President-elect Clinton had a warm and informative conversation in the Oval Office today which lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes. President Bush reviewed a number of trouble spots around the world and discussed United States policy in these areas.
At approximately 2:15 p.m., the President and President-elect visited their transition staffs in the Roosevelt Room. President Bush said he wanted a smooth transition and said he appreciated the task that lay ahead of the transition team. The transition meeting was attended by Secretary Andrew Card, Chase Untermeyer, and Bob Zoellick representing the administration; Vernon Jordan, Warren Christopher, Alexis Herman, and Mark Gearan representing President-elect Clinton. The discussion focused on procedures for making appointments, including FBI clearances and financial disclosure forms.
The two transition teams will maintain regular contacts. Secretary Card will maintain a small staff here in the White House and will oversee three transition phases: President Bush's departure and establishment of an office in Houston; the transfer of authority from the Bush administration to the Clinton administration; and the process of transferring Presidential papers to the Archives or Presidential library.
Both President Bush and President-elect Clinton expressed satisfaction with the meeting.
