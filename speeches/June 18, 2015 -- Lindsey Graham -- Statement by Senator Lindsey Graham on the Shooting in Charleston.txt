    Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the people of Charleston. We are all heartbroken by this tragedy.
To the families of the victims, please know that you are being prayed for and loved by so many in the community and across the nation. I pray that God will provide you healing in the coming days.
There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate. Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts.
Our sense of security and well-being has been robbed and shaken.
