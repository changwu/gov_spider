    Former New Hampshire Governor and U.S. Senator Judd Gregg made the following statement on tonight's debate in Las Vegas:
"Mitt Romney showed again tonight why he is Republicans' best candidate to defeat President Obama and turn around our failing economy. Whether it is his economic know-how or plan to create jobs, Mitt Romney stands head-and-shoulders above the rest of the field. In November 2012, Republicans will need a candidate with the record, vision, and capability to go up against President Obama â€“ Mitt Romney displayed that once again tonight."
