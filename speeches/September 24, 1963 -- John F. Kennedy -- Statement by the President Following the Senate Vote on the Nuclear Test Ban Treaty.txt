    The action of the United States Senate in giving its advice and consent to the nuclear test ban treaty is a welcome culmination of this effort to lead the world once again to the path of peace. The wide support of Senators of both parties given to the treaty after an extensive and wide-ranging debate is evidence not only that the treaty has wide public support, but also of the collective judgment that this instrument is good for the people of the United States and people all over the world. I congratulate the Senate for its action and wish to particularly commend the painstaking work of the leaders of both parties in the Senate and Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas in bringing the treaty to this highly satisfactory vote.
