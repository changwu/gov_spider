    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/3/92)(House)(Martinez (D) CA and six others)
The Administration would not object to House passage of H.R. 5630, but will work with the Senate to delete objectionable and restrictive provisions that would:

—   Limit the ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to target Quality Improvement Funds within a State to the neediest Head Start grantees.
—   Allow grantees to use Head Start funds to purchase facilities in which they run their programs. The Administration is concerned that this provision would result in a host of administrative problems and would divert funds that would otherwise be available to provide services to children in Head Start programs. For these reasons, the provision needs further study. 
The Administration is concerned with the scope of the provision to expand the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reduce the 20 percent non-Federal matching requirement that Head Start grantees must provide and will work with the Senate to amend this provision.
