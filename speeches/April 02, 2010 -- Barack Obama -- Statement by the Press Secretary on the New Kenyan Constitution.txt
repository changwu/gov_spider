    The United States welcomes the Kenyan parliamentâ€™s overwhelming approval of a new draft constitution. We are encouraged by the strong statements made by President Kibaki and Prime Minister Odinga in support of the draft. A unified effort to see this important reform element through can help to turn the page to a promising new chapter of Kenyan history.
The people of Kenya will soon have the opportunity to exercise their will through a national referendum. The United States will continue to support the Kenyan people in their efforts to ensure that future generations will enjoy peaceful, democratic, and transparent governance. We urge all Kenyans to focus on the future of their nation and to unify in support of a peaceful and credible referendum and electoral process.
