In-town pool report #5: Remarks wrap up 
POTUS remarks wrapped up at 12:43pm and he yielded the floor to Justice Breyer.
POTUS vowed to nominate a black woman and said the decision will come by the end of February. The president called today "bittersweet."
Justice Breyer directed his remarks to the next generation. At one point during his remarks, he held up a pocket-sized Constitution. He said "we are now engaged in a great civil war" (Gettysburg Address reference) and spoke of the experiment of justice. His remarks wrapped up at 12:48.
POTUS then took the podium again and invited Dr. Breyer and the Justice to the White House anytime.
POTUS said he wouldn't take any questions because it would be "inappropriate" given Justice Breyer was present and is still serving. He did not respond to shouted questions from the pool.
The four left at 12:49, with POTUS holding the door and exiting last. Pool was ushered out shortly afterwards.
