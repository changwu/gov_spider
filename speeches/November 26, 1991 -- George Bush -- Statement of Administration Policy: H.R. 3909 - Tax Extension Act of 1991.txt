    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rostenkowski (D) IL)
The Administration has no objection to enactment of H.R. 3909.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3909 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). If H.R. 3909 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
OMB's preliminary estimate is that H.R. 3909 would reduce the deficit for pay-as-you-go purposes in each of FYs 1992-1995. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
