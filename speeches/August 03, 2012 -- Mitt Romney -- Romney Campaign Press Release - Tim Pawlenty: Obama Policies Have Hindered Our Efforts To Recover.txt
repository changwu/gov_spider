    Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty today made the following statement on the July employment report:
"Today's economic numbers confirm what everyone outside the Obama White House understands â€” we are trapped in a low-growth, high-unemployment economy. The Obama Administration's policies have not only failed to get the economy growing again, but they've also hindered our efforts to recover. This is the worst recovery America has seen in decades, and President Obama is offering nothing more than new regulations, more deficit spending, higher taxes, and an upside-down energy policy as a 'solution.' Mitt Romney has a carefully crafted plan that will help middle-class families not only get through this difficult period, but move on to a new era of prosperity. Americans are paying a devastating price for failed leadership. It's time to move in a new direction."
