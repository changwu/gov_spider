    AUSTIN â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today received the endorsement of Florida's next Senate President Don Gaetz (R-Niceville, Fla.) in his campaign for president of the United States.
"No one is better prepared to get America back on track than Gov. Rick Perry," said Senator Gaetz. "Gov. Perry has proven his effectiveness in establishing a robust environment for job creation. Since just June of 2009, Texas has created approximately 40 percent of the net new jobs in America while President Obama's policies have led to historic unemployment and deepening economic despair for families and small businesses."
"For the first time in my life, I am frightened for the future of my country," Gaetz said. "Ultra-liberal, debt-piling mandates like Obamacare dictated from Washington won't bring prosperity to our communities and are driving our country toward decline and weakness. By contrast, Gov. Perry has created a model for success based on common sense and balanced budgets."
"With 29 electoral votes, Florida could well be the turning point state in presidential politics this year. President Obama knows he has to win Florida or lose the election. Rick Perry has the best chance among Republicans to carry Florida and win the Presidency."
"Senator Gaetz is a leader in Florida's business community and is one of the state's most respected public servants. He understands firsthand the significance of job creation and sensible economic policies to get America working again," Gov. Perry said. "I am honored to have his support and look forward to working closely with him as we bring our campaign for America's future to Florida."
