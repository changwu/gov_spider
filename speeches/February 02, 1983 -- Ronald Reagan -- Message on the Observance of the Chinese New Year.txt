    In this, the Year of the Boar, it is a pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to all those celebrating this Lunar New Year, 4681.
On February 13 of the Western calendar, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans welcome the dawn of a new year and rejoice in the promise of a period filled with happiness and good fortune. It is a time to reaffirm hopes and goals and a time to cast away the troubles of the old yearâ€”a time to take pride in what we have accomplished and to look ahead with enthusiasm to all that we will be able to achieve in the months ahead.
According to ancient lore, those born in the Year of the Boar are lucky in all ways and their lives are marked by success. As one born in this auspicious year, I am delighted to join with you in celebrating this very special year, and it is my heartfelt wish that any good fortune that I derive from it will auger well for our country.
May 4681 bring each of you health, prosperity, and well-being.
RONALD REAGAN
