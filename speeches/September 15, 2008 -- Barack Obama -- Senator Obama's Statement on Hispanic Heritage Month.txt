    Chicago, IL - Senator Barack Obama joined millions of Americans today in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, which is celebrated from September 15 through October 15, and issued the following statement:
"This month, I join all Americans in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. It's a time to honor the achievements and sacrifices of Hispanic Americans, from their long and proud tradition of military service to the visionary leadership of CÃ©sar Chavez to today's ongoing struggles for opportunity and prosperity. It's a time to recognize all Hispanic Americans who have helped write the social, economic, and cultural story of America.
"And after all the progress we have made together, we cannot turn back. We must march ahead. I've walked alongside the Hispanic community in Chicago, I've stood with you at immigration rallies, and I will fight for you in the White House. And now is the time for us to create good-paying jobs, reduce the student dropout rate, and finally enact the DREAM Act. It's time to finally pass comprehensive immigration reform, provide 15 million uninsured Latinos with affordable, high-quality health care, and end the war in Iraq. It's time to make sure the next four years don't look just like the last eight.
"At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to always march ahead. What has always distinguished the Hispanic community - and what distinguishes us as Americans - is our belief that in America, you can make it if you try. This month, and every month, we keep that promise. This November, we must renew it," said Senator Barack Obama.
