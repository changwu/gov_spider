Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today. She is the worst! No wonder with people like her and Cryin' Chuck Schumer D.C. has been such a mess for so long - and that includes the previous administration who (and now we know for sure) SPIED on my campaign.Retweets: 28720Favorites: 119193

So if Comey & the top people in the FBI were dirty cops and cheated on the FISA Court wouldn't all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed? They went after me with the Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC which they illegally presented to FISA...Retweets: 24858Favorites: 89161

....They want to Impeach me (I'm not worried!) and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways. How can they do that and yet impeach a very successful (Economy Plus) President of the United States who has done nothing wrong? These people are Crazy!Retweets: 17896Favorites: 69527

.@marcthiessen 'Voters say the Democrats are trying to take away their votes. Pelosi was right the first time. Impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the Democrats. How can you Impeach the President for going to the courts?'Retweets: 12968Favorites: 53347

'They just wanted to get at the President. They had no intention of having a proper investigation. They couldn't find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of Congress which every administration from the beginning has done.' @RepDougCollins @foxandfriendsRetweets: 14801Favorites: 61680

'It's sad. Here's a gentleman who came to the White House and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath. All they wanted to do is impeach him. They started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in. But this President came to Washington and....Retweets: 18805Favorites: 81386

In the end here nothing happened. We don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office. I believe that a President can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate..Retweets: 19633Favorites: 89128
