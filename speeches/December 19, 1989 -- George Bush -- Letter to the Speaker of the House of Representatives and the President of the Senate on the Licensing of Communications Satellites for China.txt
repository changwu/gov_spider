Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 610 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990 (P.L. 101 - 162) ("the Act"), and as President of the United States, I hereby report that it is in the national interest of the United States to lift the prohibition on reinstatement and approval of export licenses for the three United States-built AUSSAT and AsiaSat satellites for launch on Chinese-built launch vehicles.
Sincerely,
George Bush
