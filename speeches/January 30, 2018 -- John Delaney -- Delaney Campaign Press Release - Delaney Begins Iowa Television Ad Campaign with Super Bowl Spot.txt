    Delaney will make sixth campaign trip to Iowa this weekend
WASHINGTON – Congressman John K. Delaney (MD-6) will be on the air in Iowa this Sunday with a Super Bowl spot. The ad, titled "Dirty Word" will air in the Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport and Sioux City markets and will highlight Delaney's bipartisan approach. The spot is the beginning of a month-long, million dollar Iowa television buy from the Delaney campaign, that will feature multiple ads. Delaney will make his sixth campaign trip to Iowa this weekend.
Delaney announced his campaign in July with an op-ed in the Washington Post, writing: "our government is hamstrung by excessive partisanship. We are letting critical opportunities to improve the country pass us by. And we are not even talking about the most important thing: the future. The victims of this leadership failure are the good people we are sworn to serve, and we are leaving our country ill-prepared for dramatic changes ahead."
In 2017, Delaney was named one of the World's Greatest Leaders by Fortune for his work in building support for a bipartisan infrastructure plan. Gov Track rates Delaney as one of the most bipartisan members of the House of Representatives, currently ranking sixth amongst House Democrats for having Republican cosponsors for his legislation and ninth amongst all members for cosponsoring bipartisan bills.

It's true.
We openly admit it.
John Delaney said a dirty word in Davenport
Then repeated it in Des Moines
And Sioux City too.
In fact, he's been saying it all
across the state.
Unabashedly telling people he's
a firm believer in, well…
JOHN
"…bipartisanship…"

It might be a dirty word in
Washington.
But it seems to be awfully
refreshing right here in Iowa.
