    One year ago, an earthquake off the island of Sumatra caused a violent tsunami. The tsunami swept across the Indian Ocean and caused enormous destruction from Asia to the Horn of Africa. More than 200,000 men, women, and children lost their lives, and entire villages were destroyed. A year later, we remember those days of sorrow, and we also recall acts of courage and kindness as America and many other nations rallied to help those in need and provide urgent relief. Our Nation is proud of the efforts and generosity of our Armed Services, relief professionals, volunteers, and all those who made contributions to the relief effort. We remain committed to helping the citizens of affected nations rebuild their economies, communities, and lives. At this time of remembrance, the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with those who suffered from this tragedy. May God comfort all those affected by the tsunami and give them strength in the years ahead.
