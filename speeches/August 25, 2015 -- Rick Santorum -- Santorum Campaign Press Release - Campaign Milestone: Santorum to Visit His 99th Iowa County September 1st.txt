    Winner of the 2012 Iowa Republican Presidential Caucus and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) will complete his second "Full Grassley" on Tuesday, September 1st during a visit Lyon County.
The "Full Grassley," is named after U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) who visits each Iowa county each year. Senator Santorum committed to following the lead of his former Senate colleague and visit each of Iowa's 99 counties during 2015.
During the 2012 campaign, Senator Santorum visited each of Iowa's 99 counties, completing the "Full Grassley" in early November 2011. Santorum's pace and commitment to Iowa voters during the 2016 campaign has him two months ahead of his victorious pace of four years ago.
Senator Santorum's celebration in Rock Rapids, Iowa (Lyon County) is open to the public. Press interested in attending should RSVP to Matt Beynon at matt@ricksantorum.com.
