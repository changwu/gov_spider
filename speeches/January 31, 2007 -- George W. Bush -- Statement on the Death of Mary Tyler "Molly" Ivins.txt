    Molly Ivins was a Texas original. She was loved by her readers and by her many friends, particularly in central Texas. I respected her convictions, her passionate belief in the power of words, and her ability to turn a phrase. She fought her illness with that same passion. Her quick wit and commitment to her beliefs will be missed. Laura and I send our condolences to Molly Ivins's family and friends.
