    Former Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement on the Obama Administration's refusal to say whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel:
"If Israel can't even count on the White House press secretary to acknowledge that its capital city is Jerusalem, then how can it count on Barack Obama's support in the face of threats to its security? Israel deserves America's unequivocal support, not the dismissive treatment it has received from this Administration."
