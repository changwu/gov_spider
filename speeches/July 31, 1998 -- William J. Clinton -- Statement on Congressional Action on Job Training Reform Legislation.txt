    I am pleased that both Houses of Congress have now passed a comprehensive bill to give Americans new opportunities and choices to train for the jobs of the future. This bill will modernize job training to fit the needs of today's economy, and I appreciate the bipartisan spirit that prevailed in getting that done. Modeled on my "GI bill" for America's workers, this new training bill streamlines the vast array of existing job programs and empowers individuals to learn new skills with a simple grant. It makes sure that job training helps Americans meet the demand of a rapidly changing economy, and I look forward to signing it into law.
