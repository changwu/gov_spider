    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and two others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1224. The objective of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act — to improve the management of anadromous fishery resources — has been met. Projects which currently receive Federal grants under the Act should in the future be funded by the States.
