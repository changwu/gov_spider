    I send greetings to those who are observing Passover this week, beginning at sundown on April 16.
For Jewish families across the United States and around the world, Passover is a time of joy and renewal. This holiday celebrates the deliverance of the Jewish people from oppression and marks their birth as a nation. In remembering the Israelites' liberation from enslavement and their Exodus from Egypt, Passover reminds individuals of God's faithfulness and of the triumph of good over evil. It is also a time for families and friends to follow in the footsteps of their forefathers and to gather at the Seder table to eat special foods, offer prayers, and sing songs that celebrate their rich heritage, the power of faith, and the eternal blessings of liberty.
The story of the Exodus, as found in the Scriptures, is timeless and universal. More than 3,000 years ago, the children of Abraham learned of our Creator's love and mercy as they reaffirmed man's natural desire for liberty. Every year since then, Jews remember the miracles that led their ancestors out of bondage and to the Promised Land.
As the international community works to face great challenges and embrace important opportunities, the United States remains committed to peace, justice, and opportunity. During this time of great consequence, we resolve to bring about a rebirth of freedom and promise in troubled regions around the world.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy Passover. We also hope the holy season will bring a renewal of faith, comfort, and hope for all.
