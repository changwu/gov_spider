So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!Retweets: 45008Favorites: 208470

The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united! The Dem's case is so bad that they don't even want to go to trial!Retweets: 23643Favorites: 106116

The reason the Democrats don't want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they don't want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the Whistleblower the missing second Whistleblower the informer the Bidens to testify!Retweets: 33502Favorites: 126326

'This is political malpractice. This is a horrible judgement call on the part of the Speaker. You put your members in Trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. It's only going to extend it out further. This looks like the joke that it actually is.' Ben DomenechRetweets: 18110Favorites: 80194

Working men and women in the Country are the beneficiaries of a President who's doing exactly what he said he was going to do that is to restore prosperity for all Americans.' @LouDobbs Thank you Lou!Retweets: 19840Favorites: 82376

A far left magazine or very 'progressive' as some would call it which has been doing poorly and hasn't been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years Christianity Today knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather.....Retweets: 19722Favorites: 82441

....have a Radical Left nonbeliever who wants to take your religion & your guns than Donald Trump as your President. No President has done more for the Evangelical community and it's not even close.

I guess the magazine 'Christianity Today' is looking for Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders or those of the socialist/communist bent to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals or religion itself!Retweets: 24610Favorites: 116242
