    Today, the State Department announced the appointment of Ambassador Jeff Feltman as the U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa. Ambassador Feltman's work will build on our ongoing efforts to address the urgent crises in Ethiopia, where we continue to urge the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces, the cessation of hostilities by all parties, and unimpeded humanitarian access. We also urge leaders of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan to come together and resolve their disputes around the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam and their shared water resources. The United States is ready to work with our allies and partners to promote shared peace and prosperity across the Horn of Africa.
