    Bachmann Iowa political director Wes Enos fires back at Mrs. Bachmann's claim that Sen. Sorenson's desertion was financially-motivated
ANKENY, Iowa — U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann's Iowa political director Wes Enos recently made enlightening comments concerning Iowa State Sen. Kent Sorenson's defection to the Ron Paul camp from his position as Iowa Chairman for the Minnesota congresswoman's campaign for the presidency.
Hours ago, Sen. Sorenson resigned from his post with the Bachmann camp and publicly endorsed Ron Paul for the presidency, committing to get out the vote for the 12-term Congressman from Texas in the pivotal first-in-nation voting contest.
Mr. Enos made his comments in response to unfounded allegations that Sen. Sorenson's defection was made due to financial incentives made by the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign. Mr. Enos's comments on the matter follow, and are presented in full:
"I won't say much about the situation or the conflicting statements beyond this; I can say unequivocally that Kent Sorenson's decision was, in no way financially motivated. His decision had more to do with the fact that the Ron Paul supporters have been something of a family to him since he was first elected in 2008 and here in the end, as it becomes more and more apparent that the caucus cycle is coming to an end, Kent believed that he needed to be with them as they stand on the cusp of a potential caucus upset. While I personally disagree with Kent's decision, and plan to stay with Michele Bachmann because I truly believe in her, I cannot, in good conscious watch a good man like Kent Sorenson be attacked as a 'sell-out' ….That is simply not the case, and it was not the basis of his decision," said Mr. Enos.
