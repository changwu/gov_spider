    On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Barack Obama extends his congratulations to the people of Germany – and the people of Europe. On November 9, 1989, Germans from both sides of the wall joined together, moving freely between East and West – something that had been denied them for over a generation. This year, we commemorate and recognize their decision, and the decisions of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe in 1989 to choose freedom over oppression, liberty over captivity, and hope over despair.
President Obama today announced the designation of a Presidential Delegation to Berlin, Germany to attend the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 2009.
The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State, will lead the delegation.
