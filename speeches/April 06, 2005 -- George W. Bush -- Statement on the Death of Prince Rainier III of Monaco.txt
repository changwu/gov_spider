    Laura and I join Americans across the country in mourning the loss of His Serene Highness Prince Rainier III of Monaco. He will be remembered as a respected leader who secured the prosperity of Monaco's people. Monaco and the United States have long had a special bond of friendship. We extend our deepest condolences to His Serene Highness Prince Albert, to the Grimaldi family, and to all the people of Monaco.
