    I was greatly saddened to learn of the untimely death of President Makarios. His passing deprives the Republic of Cyprus and the world of a great statesman. We share the sorrow of the people of Cyprus over the loss of a man whose many years as leader of the Cypriot nation have left such a deep mark on history.
