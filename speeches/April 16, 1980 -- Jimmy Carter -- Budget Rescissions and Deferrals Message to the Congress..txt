    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 53 proposals to rescind a total of $1,472.7 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting 21 new deferrals totalling $6,916.4 million.
These rescission proposals and deferrals are an integral part of my recently announced anti-inflation program, and will help achieve a balanced Federal budget in 1981.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
