    Economic Program
Q. Mr. President, what kind of concerns are you hearing from congressional leaders?
The President. I think they want me to give them a good, credible program, and one that will get the economy—
Space Program
Q. Will you be cutting the space station, Mr. President?
The President. Tune in Wednesday. Before I discuss any specifics—I support—I think you all know I've always been a big supporter of NASA and the space program and the technologies it can represent. I think that people who care about that will be pleased by the recommendations we make.
Somalia
Q. Will the troops be coming home from Somalia?
The Vice President. Thanks for coming to the photo op. [Laughter]
Q. Will the troops be coming home from Somalia, sir, by April?
The President. Well, I'm encouraged by what the Secretary-General said today. This does need to go from a U.S. mission from a U.N. mission. I never thought we could do it. Even though I think President Bush hoped we could, I never thought we could do it by the end of January. And I'm hopeful, by the timetable he has suggested today. And I'll do some work on that Monday.
