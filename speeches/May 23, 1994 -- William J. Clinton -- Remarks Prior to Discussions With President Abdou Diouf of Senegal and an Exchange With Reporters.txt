    The President. Let me say, it's a great honor for me to have the President of Senegal here and to thank him publicly for the leadership that his country has shown in promoting democracy and economic market reforms and many activities of the United Nations designed to save lives. I am very grateful for that, and I look forward to this meeting. We've never had an opportunity to talk before, but our two nations have had very close and good relationships, and I think we'll continue them.

Q. Mr. President, can you tell us something about your remarks this afternoon?
The President. Well, I'll just do the best I can to try to speak on behalf of the Nation a word of gratitude and appreciation and farewell and perhaps a few personal remarks as well.
