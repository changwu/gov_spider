    Dear Bo:
It is with a very special sense of regret but also with profound appreciation for your outstanding service to our Nation, that I accept your resignation as Secretary of the Army, effective July 3, 1975.
For more than two years, your leadership has moved the Army forward with most impressive results. Through your efforts, an all volunteer Army has become reality, as more and more highly qualified young men and women choose to make the Army a career. You have established the Army's credibility with the Congress and the American people. Today's Army is accomplishing more with less than any Army in our history.
Under your guidance, the young men and women of today's Army are filled with enthusiasm for what they are doing. The result is a renewed pride and sense of mission within the Army, and a much greater respect for our men and women in uniform among the American people.
You will be greatly missed at Defense, but it is because of my unqualified confidence and trust in your abilities that I have asked you to take on an entirely different but singularly important set of responsibilities and I am deeply grateful for your willingness to do so.
As you step down as Secretary of the Army, you may take tremendous pride in your outstanding contributions to our country and this Administration, and I hope you will look back on these past two years with pride in what has been achieved. You have served with great distinction, and I look forward to our future association.
Betty joins me in extending to Beth and you our best wishes and warmest personal regards.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable Howard H. Callaway, Secretary of the Army, Washington, D.C. 20310]
