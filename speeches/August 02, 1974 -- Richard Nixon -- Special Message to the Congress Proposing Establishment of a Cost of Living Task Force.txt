    To the Congress of the United States:
Earlier this year, before the expiration of the legislation authorizing the Cost of Living Council, I proposed to the Congress that a residual group within the Executive Office of the President be authorized to monitor wages and prices, as an on-going part of our fight against inflation. The Congress did not act on this proposal.
In my economic address on May 25 of this year, I called for the establishment of a Cost of Living Task Force to monitor wages and prices. Again, no Congressional authorization was forthcoming. While I continue to oppose mandatory wage and price controls, it is essential that wages and prices be carefully watched, that labor and management be constantly aware of public concern in this area, and that Government have the information it needs to persuade labor and management to do their duty in the effort to reduce inflation. We have carried out this monitoring function as best we can with our existing resources, under the leadership of my Counsellor for Economic Policy, Kenneth Rush. The need for a properly authorized group continues, however, and it now appears that many Members of the Congress are prepared to reconsider their earlier opposition to my proposal for such a group. A senate spokesman for the majority party of the Congress is now advocating such a proposal.
Therefore, I am today transmitting a legislative proposal to establish a Cost of Living Task Force. I invite all those who have come to see the need for this proposal to join as bipartisan co-sponsors in this vital step in our fight against inflation.
