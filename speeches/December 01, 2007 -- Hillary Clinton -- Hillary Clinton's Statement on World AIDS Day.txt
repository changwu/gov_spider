    "Today, on World AIDS Day we are reminded that AIDS is not just an African problem, an Asian problem, or an American problem. It's not someone else's problem. It's a problem of our common humanity, and we are called to respond, with love, with mercy, and with urgency. And though we have made progress on many fronts, there are still 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS around the world, and here in America, HIV infection rates are rising among gay men and African Americans. The disease is taking a disproportionate toll on other communities of color, and it is an outrage that HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death of black women between the ages of 25 and 34. The time for action and leadership is now.
"That is why I have called for a doubling in funding for research for new treatments and a vaccine as well as investments in prevention, education, and access to treatment and other services. I have also proposed to increase funding for the global HIV/AIDS fight to at least $50 billion by 2013.
"But neither money nor government alone will solve this problem. We must all work together to care for those who are infected and their families, remove the stigma by showing it's not a sin to be sick, and encourage prevention and promote healthy behaviors. Then and only then will we be able to declare victory for this pandemic."
