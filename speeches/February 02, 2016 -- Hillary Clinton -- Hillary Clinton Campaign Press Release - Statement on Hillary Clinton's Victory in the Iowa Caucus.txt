    Hillary for America's Iowa State Director Matt Paul released the following statement following Hillary Clinton's victory in tonight's Iowa Caucus:
"Hillary Clinton has won the Iowa Caucus. After thorough reporting – and analysis – of results, there is no uncertainty and Secretary Clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegates. Statistically, there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clinton's advantage."
