    Jill and I send our deepest condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones in the devastating floods in Libya. In this difficult hour, the United States is sending emergency funds to relief organizations and coordinating with the Libyan authorities and the U.N. to provide additional support. We join the Libyan people in grieving the loss of too many lives cut short and send our hope to all those missing loved ones.
