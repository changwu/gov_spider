LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul remains competitive in a head-to-head matchup against incumbent President Barack Obama, according to a new USA Today/Gallup poll.
Paul garners 46 percent of the vote to Obama's 49 percent, within the +/- 4 percent margin of error for the survey. Paul fares better among nationally registered voters than fellow GOP competitors Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich.  Paul's main competitor nationally, Mitt Romney, comes in tied with Obama at 48 percent, meaning Paul and Romney — the only candidates with the resources for a 50-state campaign — are within the error margin for unseating Obama.
"We've been saying this has been a two-man race between Ron Paul and Mitt Romney, and this poll is further proof. The survey also demonstrates Ron Paul's competitive edge against the sitting President in a general election since Paul is the candidate capable of gaining support from independents and disenfranchised Democrats," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
The results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 27th and 28th, with a random sample of 907 registered voters, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

This poll follows a January 16th CNN/ORC Poll showing Paul and Obama in a virtual tie in a general election showdown. It also follows a CBS Poll from earlier this month showing independent voters' preference for Paul over Obama by 7 percentage points.
