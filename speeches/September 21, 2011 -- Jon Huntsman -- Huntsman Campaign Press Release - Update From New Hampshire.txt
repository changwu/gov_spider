Greetings from New Hampshire!
We were happy to have had Governor Huntsman in the state last week to hold his first town hall event at New England College - the house was packed.
We visited Merrimack High School (thanks for rolling out the marching band!) where Governor Huntsman was able to speak Chinese with their students and see their biodiesel lab. We toured Rokon Motorcycles, a great "made in America" manufacturer in Rochester and spoke to groups in Sandown, Exeter and Salem.
The buzz following the trip has been great with Foster's Daily Democrat, one of the major daily newspapers in the state, penning an editorial that said: "…Huntsman may finally offer the hope and change denied the country under President Obama's tenure…We do urge voters to spend the time to understand who Huntsman is and what he would do if chosen to occupy the Oval Office. We assure you it will be time and effort well spent."
And just yesterday the Union Leader reported that the third most influential person on the Seacoast according to the Portsmouth Herald, Renee Riedel-Plummer, is endorsing Governor Huntsman's campaign calling him, "the only candidate in the race who understands what needs to be done in order to get our economy moving and create jobs."
We are excited to have Governor Huntsman back in the Granite State on Saturday for a picnic hosted by the Milford/Amhert GOP committees and a town hall in Raymond.
If you are a Granite Stater and looking to get involved, you can SIGN UP HERE to volunteer and attend our events. Our New Hampshire team is growing rapidly and we could use your support!
