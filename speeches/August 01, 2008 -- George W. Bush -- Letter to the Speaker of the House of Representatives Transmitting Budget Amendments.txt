    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 Budget for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, and State, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. The amounts requested are fully offset by proposed reductions to other accounts.
Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2009 Budget would not be increased by these proposed requests.
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
