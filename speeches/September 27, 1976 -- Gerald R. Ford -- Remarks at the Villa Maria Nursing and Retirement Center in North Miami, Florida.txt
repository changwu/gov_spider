    I want to thank the administration and the diocese. I think the Villa Maria Nursing and Retirement Home epitomizes what kind of opportunities we want for all of our older citizens and all of those who are disabled and need the best care and attention.
History judges a nation on how well it takes care of its older people, and the United States of America has an obligation to do the maximum, because as I look around this room and have the opportunity to say hello and to express my best, I know how much all of you and your generation have done to make this country what it is today.
And so those of us, and younger generations than myself, have a moral obligation to make certain and to make positive that you have wonderful facilities like this, and that you have kind people like the nurses and the doctors and the administrators-- that they have a superb opportunity to do all they can to help you.
I promise you that our retirement nursing homes will be expanded, will be made more available, because we have a serious moral commitment and obligation to make a better America as you mature and as you retire, and I pledge that to all of you and to all like you.
Good luck, and God bless you.
