    In response to the suggestion of the Senate leadership and the Senate Foreign Assistance Subcommittee, the President will withdraw the notification of the sale for AWACS to Iran and resubmit it on the day the Congress returns, September 7, to be part of fiscal year 1977 arms sales.
Congress time is short because of other priority legislation. The President is anxious to give Members of the Senate and House sufficient time, as they have requested, to debate the complex technical issue of the proposed sale.
The President is confident that once Congress fully discusses the proposed sale and assesses the assurances we have provided regarding the security and management of the AWACS system in Iran, the sale will receive favorable congressional review.
