    On Monday, January 30th, as part of the First Lady's Joining Forces initiative, Dr. Biden and Deputy Secretary of Defense Dr. Kathleen Hicks will visit U.S. Army Garrison Fort Drum, New York, the home of the storied 10th Mountain Division, to meet with military families. During the visit, Dr. Biden will meet with military spouses and leaders in the military-connected community to discuss improving employment opportunities for military spouses, one of Joining Forces' focus areas to increase economic security for military families. This visit will be open press. For interested media, please RSVP HERE by Friday, January 27th as 6:00 PM ET.
The mission of Joining Forces is to support those who also serve: military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. The First Lady's work and priorities of Joining Forces are guided by the life experiences and the perspectives shared during listening sessions with military families.
