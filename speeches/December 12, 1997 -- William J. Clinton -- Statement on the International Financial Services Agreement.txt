    Since I took office, I have been committed to tearing down barriers to American goods and services exports. Today's agreement by over 70 countries to liberalize trade in financial services will ensure market access in sectors where we lead the world: banking, securities, and insurance. In the wake of recent financial instability, it is particularly encouraging that so many countries have chosen to move forward rather than backwards. I want to congratulate Secretary Rubin, Ambassador Barshefsky, Deputy Secretary Summers, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Lang, and Assistant Secretary Geithner for their hard work in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion.
