    Hello. Thank you. It's a lot drier than it was the last time I was here, on Valentine's Day. I'm glad to see you all. And I am so thankful that you're out here. I don't know if you can hear, but the Vice President and I are glad to be here, and we're glad to be here with Gary Locke and Mona Lee Locke, and I hope— [applause].
Thank you so much for coming out. Where's Brian Baird? Is he here? Democratic nominee for Congress, Brian Baird.
Folks, when I was here after the flood, I was so impressed with all of you—is this better? Is it better? [Applause]
When I was here after the flood, I was so impressed with all of you I talked about it for months and months and months. And I wrote a book to prepare for the campaign to tell the American people what I wanted to do in 4 more years and where I wanted our country to go. And I have a couple of mentions in that book of the day I spent here with you, the people I met, and the impression you made on me. So I came back here to thank you for what you did in demonstrating the best of America.
I want to introduce the Vice President. He wants to say a word or two. And we want to get out and shake hands, but in 6 weeks and 5 days we're going to elect the last President of the 20th century, the first President of the 21st century. We have worked hard to put this country on the right track. We are better off than we were 4 years ago, but we've got a lot left to do. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]
We need you. Thank you. God bless you. We're glad to be here. Say hello to Vice President Gore.
