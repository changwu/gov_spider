    To the Congress of the United States:
Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970, the President is required to make a decision each year on what, if any, pay adjustment should be provided for Federal employees under the General Schedule and the related statutory pay systems.
My pay advisors have reported to me that an increase in pay rates averaging 19.15 percent, to be effective in October 1985, would be required under existing procedures to raise Federal pay rates to comparability with private sector pay rates for the same levels of work. However, the law also empowers me to prepare and transmit to the Congress an alternative plan for the pay adjustment if I consider such an alternative plan appropriate because of "national emergency or economic conditions affecting the general welfare."
Accordingly, after reviewing the reports of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, and after considering the adverse effect that a 19.15 percent increase in Federal pay rates might have on our continuing national economic recovery, I have determined that economic conditions affecting the general welfare require the following alternative plan for this pay adjustment:
In accordance with section 5305(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code, the pay rates of the General Schedule and the related statutory pay schedules as adjusted by Section 1 of Executive Order No. 12496 of December 28, 1984, shall remain in effect without change.
Accompanying this report and made a part hereof are the pay schedules that will remain in effect under this alternative plan, including, as required by section 5382(c) of title 5, United States Code, the rates of basic pay for the Senior Executive Service.
