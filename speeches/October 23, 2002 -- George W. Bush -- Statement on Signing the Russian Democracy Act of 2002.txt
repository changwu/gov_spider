    I have today signed into law H.R. 2121, the "Russian Democracy Act of 2002." This Act seeks to promote democracy, the rule of law, and an independent media in the Russian Federation.
Section 3(b) of the Act purports to establish U.S. policy towards Russia. My approval of the Act does not constitute my adoption of the statements of policy in section 3(b) as U.S. foreign policy. Given the Constitution's commitment to the presidency of the authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs, the executive branch shall construe such policy statements as advisory, giving them the due weight that comity between the legislative and executive branches should require, to the extent consistent with U.S. foreign policy.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, October 23, 2002.
