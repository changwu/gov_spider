    
It was quite a year.
Presidential politics is a tough business—but it's also an incredibly inspiring one. Here are six moments that warmed our hearts (and a few that left us misty-eyed) this year.

1. When a 12-year-old feminist wrote this letter to Hillary Clinton about the future she wants to see.


2. When one man told us the love story that helped pave the way for marriage in all 50 states ...


... a historic moment that made us all proud.

3. When these little girls hand-wrote letters about what a woman president would mean to them.

4. When a man in New Hampshire told Hillary a story about his mom that moved her to tears.


5. When a former janitor saved up $1,000 to support his favorite presidential candidate—and then he got to meet her.



6. When a pint-sized politico got some encouragement—and the right outfit—to run for president.
