    CONCORD, N.H. â€“ Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Thursday filed papers with New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner to place the senator's name on the primary election ballot as a Democratic Party candidate for president.
On his way out of the Capitol, Sanders signed the storied candidate guest book. "We need a political revolution," he wrote. "Our government belongs to all of us, not just the 1 percent."
Addressing a rally attended by some 725 supporters outside the Statehouse, Sanders attributed the campaign's growing momentum to an outpouring of grassroots support in New Hampshire and across the country.
"What this campaign is about is saying no to a campaign finance system which is corrupt," he said.
"What this campaign is about is saying no to an economy which is rigged," he added.
"What the political revolution is about is creating a government which works for all of us, not just the 1 percent," Sanders said.
When he filed the paperwork to get his name on the ballot, Sanders was accompanied to the secretary of state's office by Raymond Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman.
Buckley had written a letter to the secretary of state on Oct. 7 saying the New Hampshire Democratic Party "considers Senator Bernie Sanders to be a member of the Democratic Party and supports the placement of his name into nomination as a Democratic candidate for president in the 2016 New Hampshire primary."
