    During National Mentoring Month, we celebrate the dedicated men and women who volunteer their time, talents, and resources to mentor, teach, and empower young people and those in need of guidance.
Mentors form a cross section of America. They are spiritual leaders, coaches, volunteers in civic organizations, business owners, teachers, counselors, school administrators, and many others. They come from diverse backgrounds, and in many inspiring ways, mentors improve the lives of America's youth, helping them to grow into responsible adults.
In communities across our country, mentors serve not only as role models for young people, but also as an inspiration to dream big and pursue any goal, regardless of circumstance. Their acts of generosity and compassion are a reminder that each of us has a deeper purpose and that we can make a positive difference by investing in others through our God-given talents.
As we conclude the holiday season and ring in the New Year, Melania and I encourage all Americans to share in the spirit of kindness during National Mentoring Month and throughout the year. Together, we will continue to pour into the lives of those in need, better equipping them to achieve their full potential.
