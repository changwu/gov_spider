    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Presidential Design Awards Program
As the largest purchaser of design services in the world, the Federal Government should be a leader in fostering design excellence. Good design can profoundly affect our lives by beautifying our surroundings, improving our productivity, and helping to effect social change.
Over two decades ago, the National Endowment for the Arts was asked by the White House to assist Federal agencies in improving the quality of design in the Federal Government. Over the years, the efforts of the Endowment's Federal Design Improvement Program have helped agencies to make significant progress in the pursuit of design excellence. I am committed to furthering those efforts.
The Presidential Design Awards Program was established in 1983 to honor successful achievement in Federal design and encourage excellence throughout the Federal Government. I recently announced the call for entries for Round Four of the Presidential Design Awards and asked Jane Alexander, Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts, to implement the Presidential Design Awards Program. I am confident that she will have your full support. Please designate an individual with an appropriate background and position to serve as your liaison with the Endowment to ensure the success of this important program. Please be advised that there will be a Presidential Design Awards Program briefing at the National Endowment for the Arts on July 18, 1994.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
