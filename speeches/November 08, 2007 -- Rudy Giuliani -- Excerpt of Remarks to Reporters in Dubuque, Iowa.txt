    MAYOR GIULIANI: "[I]t's great to be here in Iowa. I just checked in the clerk's office and I asked them a question. I asked [the] sheriff a question. I said, 'Can an illegal immigrant get a driver's license in Iowa?' And they said, 'No.' And in order to keep it that way, I've asked several members of Congress to consider passing a law that would prevent states from giving out driver's licenses, under any set of circumstances, to illegal immigrants. If, I think [Former Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection] Rob [Bonner] would probably understand this better than most, but the whole purpose of what we're trying to do is to simplify identifications and try to get it down to one form of identification for people that are here from foreign countries. We want people to come into the United States. We want people to help us grow. We want people to help us with our economy. We want people to help us with our society and our future. But we want them to do it legally and we want them to do it in a way in which they identify themselves. And the idea of giving out driver's licenses will already take a very confused picture and … it'll be much more confused. It'd be impossible to do employer verification. … It's going to make the job of all the immigration officials and local officials that much more complex. I just discussed it with the Sheriff and as you might expect, here in Iowa, he's got the common sense to understand that and he told me just exactly what I just said. So I want you to know that we're going to push very, very hard to get this done … "
