    John Kasich has created more than 400,000 good-paying jobs in Ohioâ€”including bringing jobs here from Mexico and China, places that Donald Trump has sent jobs. More of our members are working today because he understands the importance of investing in infrastructure and he's done it without raising taxes, in fact he's cut taxes for working families. It's why we supported John Kasich in his reelection and why I'm very comfortable supporting him for president. He grew up in a working family and he's proven he hasn't forgotten where he came from. He's got our best interests at heart and is someone who will continue to create opportunity for all Americans as president.
