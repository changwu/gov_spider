    I have signed H.R. 186, a bill to implement the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. This convention brings International Rules of the Nautical Road in line with modern maritime practices and technology. The convention, which has been ratified by the Senate, became effective for its international signatories on July 15, 1977. This bill would implement the convention fully for United States vessels.
Although I have signed this bill, I want to make clear that I have serious constitutional reservations about section 3(d). That section permits Congress, by concurrent resolution, to disapprove a proposed amendment to the convention. The Congress concurrent resolution would not be presented to the President for approval or veto. This may violate Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution.
