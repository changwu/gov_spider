    Today, First Lady Melania Trump joined a conference call with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Youth Preparedness Council (YPC) during their annual summit. The Council was formed in 2012 to bring together youth leaders interested in supporting disaster preparedness. Through national and local projects, they strive to engage children and provide the tools and resources needed to educate them on disaster preparedness.
Administer Gaynor provided welcome remarks and discussed the importance of YPC and the many achievements of its members. The Administrator then introduced the First Lady, who thanked the YPC members for allowing her to join the Summit to hear more about the ways America's children can learn how to prepare for emergencies in their homes, schools, and communities.
She expressed gratitude to the YPC members for their leadership to ensure that their families, friends, and neighbors are equipped with the tools they need to stay safe. Mrs. Trump also noted that our nation's children remain one of the most at-risk during and after disasters, and the important work FEMA's Youth Preparedness Council does to help foster the creative and innovative solutions that make their communities more resilient.
The First Lady thanked Administrator Gaynor and the YPC council members for this initiative and leadership, stating: "One of the main pillars of my Be Best Initiative focuses on the well-being of children, which includes the importance of educating young people from all backgrounds how to prepare for emergency situations. This Council embodies that pillar by integrating your voices and vital lessons for children into emergency preparedness. It is never too early for young people to learn how to react and cope during emergency situations."
