    President Bush used the occasion of the private visit of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola to review with him the status of the Angola Peace Accords. President Bush reiterated our firm commitment to the Angola peace process and to the full and timely implementation of all aspects of the accords. In light of the recent difficulties concerning the assembly and cantonment of troops and the slow pace at which discussions are proceeding toward agreement on an electoral calendar, including a precise date for elections, President Bush urged President dos Santos to resolve these issues quickly so that the peace process will maintain its momentum and genuine national reconciliation can finally be established in Angola. President Bush informed President dos Santos that we remain committed to establishing diplomatic relations with the government which emerges from free and fair internationally monitored elections. President Bush noted that he is looking forward to Angola's elections next year and reiterated our preference, also contained with the accords, that they be held in September.
