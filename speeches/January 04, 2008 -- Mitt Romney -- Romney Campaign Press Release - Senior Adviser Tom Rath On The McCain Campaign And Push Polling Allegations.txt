Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President New Hampshire Senior Adviser and former New Hampshire Attorney General Tom Rath issued the following statement regarding the McCain campaign and push polling allegations:
"Yesterday, Senator McCain's New Hampshire Vice Chairman chose to make an outrageous and irresponsible allegation by implying the Romney campaign had a connection to these calls. We know that New Hampshire voters reject these statements and so should Senator McCain. A half-hearted apology cannot undo these reckless comments. This election should be about issues and not baseless accusations, and I am calling on Senator McCain's New Hampshire Vice Chairman to immediately step down so that we can all move forward."
