    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sens. Burns (R) MT, Baucus (D) MT, and McCain (R) AZ)
The Administration supports the settlement of the water rights claims of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe and does not object to enactment of S. 1607. However, Federal appropriations to implement the settlement, except for $1.4 million to plan and design the Tongue River Dam Project, should be deferred until the State water court enters and approves the proposed water rights decree.
