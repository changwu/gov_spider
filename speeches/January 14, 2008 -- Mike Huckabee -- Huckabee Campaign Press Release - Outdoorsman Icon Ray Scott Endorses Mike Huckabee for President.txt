    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has received the endorsement of "America's Outdoor Icon" Ray Scott.
Scott founded the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) in 1968 which became the world's largest fishing organization with over 500,000 members. The company was bought in 2001 by ESPN. He is also the founder of the Whitetail Institute of North America.
"I am pleased to have received the endorsement of Ray Scott – a legendary outdoorsman and conservationist. We share a passion for the outdoors and I was proud to be honored along with him recently in Outdoor Life as one of 25 individuals who've had the greatest positive impact on hunting and fishing.
"Ray has worked hard to ensure that Americans continue to enjoy their outdoor pastimes. Even more he has helped them understand their responsibility to protect and preserve their outdoor resources and to recognize their power to improve them. Not just for themselves but for future generations."
Affectionately known as the "Bass Boss," Scott's BASS organization changed the face of sport fishing forever with his creation of Bassmaster Magazine, professionally run fishing tournaments including the Bassmaster Classic, bass fishing TV shows, and affiliated BASS clubs which became his highly effective grassroots conservation "minutemen."
"I am really pumped about Huckabee's candidacy," says Scott. I've never been a one-issue voter and I won't start now, but it's sure exciting to have an authentic angler and hunter as a candidate. I was thrilled to fid out he's been a life member of BASS since 1996. Even more important, I'm inspired by his message of hope and prosperity and strength. Like a friend of mine said, he's the 'real deal' and I think more and more people are seeing that.
"I look forward to doing my part to see to it that Mike Huckabee becomes the next President of the United States."
