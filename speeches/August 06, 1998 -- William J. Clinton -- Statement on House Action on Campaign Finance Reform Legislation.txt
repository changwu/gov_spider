    The vote for final passage of the Shays-Meehan bipartisan campaign finance reform bill is a heartening sign for the health of our democracy. The House vote to ban soft money and improve disclosure, in defiance of the Republican leadership, is a rebuke to the cynical view that political reform can never happen. Now, only a minority of the United States Senate stands in the way of campaign finance reform becoming the law of the land. I call upon those few Senators who now block reform to heed the actions of the House and the will of the people and pass bipartisan campaign finance reform. I again congratulate Representatives Christopher Shays, Marty Meehan, and all their colleagues who set aside partisanship to make real progress today.
