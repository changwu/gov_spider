    Senator John Edwards released the following statement today on the passage of New Hampshire State Senate bill raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 by 2008:
"The New Hampshire State Senate has taken an important step today in the fight to end poverty in this country and reward the hard work of struggling New Hampshire families. By raising the minimum wage to $7.25 and ensuring that tipped workers, the backbone of the service industry, see a raise for the hard work they do day in and day out, New Hampshire leaders have made an unquestionable commitment to justice and increased prosperity for New Hampshire's workers.
But we cannot stop here. We need to build a society that respects workers, and makes it possible for families to not only get by, but get ahead. I applaud New Hampshire leaders for taking a bold step today on behalf of working families and ask every American to join me in our fight for universal health care, a new energy economy, and a fairer tax code that rewards work."
