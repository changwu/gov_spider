    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the vote on the budget passed by the U.S. House of Representatives:
"We are making progress. The House of Representatives has unanimously rejected President Obama's vision of an America with higher taxes, unlimited spending, and expansive government. Owing in no small part to the leadership of Paul Ryan, it has put conservative fiscal principles into action and passed a bold budget that directly addresses the drivers of our nation's spending crisis. The House budget and my own plan share the same path forward: pro-growth tax cuts, getting federal spending under control, and strengthening entitlement programs for future generations. I look forward to working with Congress to achieve fiscal discipline and passing a budget that moves us toward a simpler, smarter, and smaller federal government."
