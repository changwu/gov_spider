    Today's GDP report is positive, but we cannot take growth and job creation for granted. For the sake of America's workers, I call on Congress to pass an economic security package that will protect American jobs and prosperity because I remain concerned about the economy. I'm pleased that consumer spending contributed to today's report, demonstrating that last year's bipartisan tax relief plan was the right thing to do for the American people and the American economy.
