    Dear Ray:
It is with deep personal regret that I am today accepting your resignation as Secretary of Labor. While I understand and appreciate your desire to devote yourself fully to your defense, I want you to know that you leave the Cabinet with my friendship and gratitude for the years of service you have given to this Administrationâ€”and for the tireless efforts you have made in my campaigns. Nancy and I are aware of the sacrifices you made to serve your country as Secretary of Labor, and the difficulties you and your family have endured. Know that in the days ahead, you and Cathy will be in our thoughts, and in our prayers.
Sincerely,
RON
[The Honorable Raymond J. Donovan, 1333 Skipwith Road, McLean, Virginia 22102]
Dear Mr. President:
It is with a profound mixture of regret and pride that I submit to you my resignation as Secretary of Labor.
It has been the greatest privilege of my life to have served for four years in the Cabinet of the best President this country has ever elected. Under your leadership, we have renewed the vitality of our economy and restored our citizens' faith in this great Nation. I know your second Administration will continue on the path to ensure the economic and spiritual growth of America.
I will be forever indebted to you for the opportunity to have served you and our country, and for your unwavering support and friendship.
Godspeed in your continued efforts.
Respectfully,
RAY RAYMOND J. DONOVAN
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
