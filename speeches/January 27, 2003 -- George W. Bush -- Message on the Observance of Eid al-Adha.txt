    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the world as you celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday.
The Qur'an teaches that the sacred feast of Eid al-Adha is a time for Muslims to join family and friends in thanking the Almighty for His many blessings and to reflect on the great sacrifice and devotion of Abraham. During this festive celebration, peace-loving people around the world, including millions of American Muslims, honor Abraham's example by sharing love and demonstrating compassion for those in need.
This year's celebration comes at a time when our world faces great challenges and important opportunities. The United States remains committed to promoting justice, tolerance, and understanding through-out the world, and we will continue to work together with our Muslim friends and people of all faiths to build a future of peace, freedom, and opportunity for all.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous celebration.
