The Administration supports the enactment of H.R. 2066, as amended.
The Administration appreciates Congressional support for the Federal Dietary Guidelines in the school meals program. Under this bill, the National School Lunch Program would continue to provide flexibility, but at the same time ensure accountability through a framework established by new Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidance. H.R. 2066 complements the USDA's school meals initiative for healthy children, which currently provides flexibility to schools through its three menu-planning options.
