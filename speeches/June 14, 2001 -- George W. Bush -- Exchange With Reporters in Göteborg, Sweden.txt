    European Union-U.S. Summit
Q. Mr. President, can you share with us your message for the European leaders?
The President. See, Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press] asked you to ask that. [Laughter] I haven't made up my mind who I'm calling on at the press conference yet, so if you don't behave, you may not get called.
Q. And chances keep diminishing. Right, sir? [Laughter]
The President. Did you put him up to that, Ron?
Q. I'm not that smart, sir. [Laughter]
The President. Let me just say this: I'm honored to be the first United States President to come to Sweden, and I appreciate so very much the hospitality that we've received, and I'm so looking forward to these discussions. What the people of Sweden and Europe will realize is that mine is an administration that is deeply committed to a prosperous Europe and a whole Europe and a free Europe. And we look forward to a constructive relationship.
