    Through nearly two decades in Congress, Jane Harman has been a champion of our national security, from standing up for our brave men and women in uniform to reforming our intelligence community after the 9/11 attacks. Michelle and I congratulate her on taking the next step in her career at Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, where she will continue to advance the policies we'll need to keep America strong and prosperous. We will miss her passionate voice in Congress, and we join the people of California in thanking her for her many years of service.
