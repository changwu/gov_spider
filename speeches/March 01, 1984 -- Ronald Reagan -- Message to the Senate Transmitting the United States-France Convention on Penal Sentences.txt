    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention Between the United States of America and France on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which was signed at Washington on January 25, 1983.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the treaty.
The Convention would permit citizens of either nation who had been convicted in the courts of the other country to serve their sentences in their home country; in each case the consent of the offender as well as the approval of the authorities of the two Governments would be required.
This Convention is significant because it represents an attempt to resolve a situation which has inflicted substantial hardships on a number of citizens of each country and has caused concern to both Governments. The treaty is similar to those currently in force with Bolivia, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Turkey. I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this Convention at an early date.
