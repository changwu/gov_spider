    When a vacancy exists or occurs in the position of postmaster of an office of the first, second, or third class, if such vacancy is not filled by nomination of some qualified person within the competitive classified civil service, the Postmaster General shall certify the fact to the Civil Service Commission which shall forthwith hold an open competitive examination to test the fitness of applicants to fill such vacancy, and when such examination has been held and the papers submitted therewith have been rated, the Commission shall furnish a certificate of not less than three eligibles, if the same can be obtained, to the Postmaster General, who shall submit to the President the name of one of the highest three eligibles for appointment to fill such vacancy; provided, that the Postmaster General may reject the name of any person or persons so certified if he shall find that by reason of character or residence such person or persons shall have become disqualified after said examination, in which event he may request said commission to complete the certificate of three names; provided that no person who has passed his 65th birthday at the date for close of receipt of applications for such examination shall be permitted to take the same unless he has been continuously in the postal service for two years immediately preceding such date; and provided further, that no person shall be examined for postmaster who has not actually resided within the delivery of the office for which application is made for two years next preceding such date; and provided further, that at the expiration of the term of any postmaster, or anticipating such expiration, the Postmaster General may, in his discretion, request the Civil Service Commission to hold an examination, or he may submit the name of such postmaster to the President for renomination without examination.
If, pursuant to this order, it is desired to submit to the President for nomination the name of a person in the competitive classified service, such person must first be found by the Civil Service Commission to possess the requisite qualifications.
No person who has passed his 65th birthday shall be appointed acting Postmaster in an office of the first, second, and third class unless he is already in the postal service.
