    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today regarding the Senate Judiciary Committee holding up Judge Leslie Southwick's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:
"Judge Leslie Southwick is a distinguished and qualified candidate who deserves a fair up or down vote on the Senate floor. The Democrats' obstructionism is a disgrace and is an example of politics at its worst. Our courts should not be compromised because of partisans who are forgoing their Constitutional responsibilities in order to pursue a political agenda.
"As President, I will work to ensure that all qualified judicial nominations receive a fair up or down vote."
