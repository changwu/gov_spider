    Local outlets across Virginia are spotlighting President Joe Biden's visit to Culpeper, Virginia where he outlined actions the Administration is taking to help cut costs for working families, and how his Build Back Better Agenda will lower the cost of prescription drugs.
The President was joined by Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (VA-07) who has been a vocal advocate for lowering prescription drug prices. He was also joined by 12-year-old Joshua Davis who, like his father, has Type-1 diabetes. Like many families across the country, the Davises spend thousands of dollars a year on insulin.
President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda is the most significant effort to bring down costs and strengthen the middle class in generations. In addition to major investments in children and care, climate, and health, the President's plan will allow Medicare to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies and cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.
