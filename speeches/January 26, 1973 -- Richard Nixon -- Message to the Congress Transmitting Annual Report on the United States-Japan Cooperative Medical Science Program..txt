    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the Sixth Annual Report of the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
This joint research effort in the medical sciences was undertaken in 1965 following a meeting between the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of the United States.
During 1972 it continued to concentrate on research in the prevention and cure of a number of diseases which are widespread in Asia.
In addition, during the past year, the scientific scope of this program was enlarged to include studies of methods to evaluate certain types of cancer which may be related to environmental pollution. A detailed review of the program's activities in leprosy and parasitic diseases was also completed, and a decision made to continue work in these areas.
The sustained success of this biomedical research program reflects its careful management, its continuously refined scientific focus, and the strong commitment to it by both of our countries. The increasingly effective research planning and communication between investigators in our two countries has intensified our scientific productivity and strengthened our determination to work together toward better health for all mankind.
