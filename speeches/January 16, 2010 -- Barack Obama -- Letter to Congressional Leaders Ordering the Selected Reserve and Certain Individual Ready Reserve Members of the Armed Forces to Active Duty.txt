    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Effective today, pursuant to sections 121 and 12304 of title 10, United States Code, I have authorized the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, to order to active duty any units, and any individual members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, of the Selected Reserve, or any member in the Individual Ready Reserve mobilization category and designated as essential under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, and to terminate the service of those units and members ordered to active duty. Members of the Armed Forces ordered to active duty pursuant to these authorities will augment the active forces in support of operations for Haiti. The authorities that have been invoked will ensure the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security can fully support the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development.
A copy of the Executive Order I have issued is enclosed.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
