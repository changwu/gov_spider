    On behalf of the American people, I want to extend my warmest congratulations to Ehud Barak upon his election as Israel's new Prime Minister. The people of Israel have given the new Prime Minister a strong mandate.
I have just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to thank him for his dedicated service to Israel. I also spoke with Prime Minister-elect Barak to congratulate him and reaffirm our Nation's steadfast support for Israel and its people. I will continue to work energetically for a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace that strengthens Israel's security. I look forward to working closely with Ehud Barak and his new government as they strive to reach that goal with their Palestinian and Arab partners.
