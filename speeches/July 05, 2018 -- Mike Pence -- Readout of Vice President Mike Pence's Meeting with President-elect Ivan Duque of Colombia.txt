    Vice President Mike Pence met today at the White House with Ivan Duque, President-elect of Colombia, to discuss the strong bilateral relationship between Colombia and the United States in advance of Mr. Duque's inauguration next month. The two leaders committed to acting decisively to combat drug production and trafficking, and reiterated the need to maintain pressure on the Maduro regime and address the tragic collapse of democracy in Venezuela. The two leaders also discussed other issues of mutual interest, including Peace Accord implementation, strengthening economic engagement, and addressing illegal immigration at the U.S. southern border.
