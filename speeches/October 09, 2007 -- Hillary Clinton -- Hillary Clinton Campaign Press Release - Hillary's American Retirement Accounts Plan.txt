    If you work hard and contribute to our country, you should have the opportunity to save and invest for a secure retirement. Hillary Clinton believes it's time for a new bargain with the American people—a bargain that reflects the changing global economy and allows all Americans to retire with security and dignity.
Part of her plan to rebuild America's middle class, Hillary's bold new American Retirement Accounts proposal helps millions of families go from just getting by to getting ahead—and finally achieving retirement security.
The plan builds on Social Security and includes generous matching tax cuts that will help tens of millions of families build wealth for their future. Working and middle class families could receive up to $1,000 in matching tax cuts from the government.
And the new American Retirement Accounts will be designed to provide no-hassle, portable savings throughout their careers. In essence, the plan will provide universal access to a generous 401(k) and ensure that Americans have the opportunity to save for a secure retirement.
