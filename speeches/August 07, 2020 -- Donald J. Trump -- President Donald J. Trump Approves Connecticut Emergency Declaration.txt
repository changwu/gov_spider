    Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump declared that an emergency exists in the State of Connecticut and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Isaias on August 4, 2020.
The President's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in all 8 Connecticut counties and the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe and Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut.
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.
Pete Gaynor, Administrator, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, named Robert V. Fogel as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
