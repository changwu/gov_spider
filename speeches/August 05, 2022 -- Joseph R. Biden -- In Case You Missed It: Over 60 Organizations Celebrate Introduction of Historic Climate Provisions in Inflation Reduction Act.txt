    Climate, clean energy, environmental justice, and other leaders are applauding the Inflation Reduction Act's historic investments to tackle the climate crisis, save families hundreds of dollars on energy costs each year, create new jobs, and improve U.S. energy security.
Read the Statement below: 
Key Democratic leaders have struck a historic deal to lower energy bills and address the climate crisis with the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 - which aims to reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and provide much needed relief on energy costs for families. In response to the announcement, 62 climate, building decarbonization, energy, health and affordable housing organizations released the following joint statement:
"Our groups welcome the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act for its historic climate investments. As our communities face extreme heat, drought, wildfires, storms and flooding - it's clear that the climate crisis and public health emergency is already upon us, and these investments set to decarbonize our buildings and homes are coming not a moment too soon.
"Provisions included in this bill will help address inflation, lower household energy costs, and improve our energy security with efficiency and electrification upgrades for homes and buildings - starting with disadvantaged communities first - so that they can run 100% renewable energy.
"The bill will also create good-paying clean energy jobs by strengthening the supply chain and accelerating the adoption of clean energy technologies like electric heat pumps through incentives that include tax credits and rebates. As a highly efficient technology, heat pumps - which provide both heating and cooling - can reduce household energy costs, and widespread adoption of the technology can reduce strain on the electric grid during extreme heat events.
"We also recognize that unfortunately - to secure the support required to pass the legislation - the bill includes some support for the continued production of fossil fuels on public lands and waters. Despite this, the bill gets many things right, and our groups celebrate much needed investments in a clean energy transition and to communities in need. The bill supports a just, equitable transition to healthier homes with incentives and rebates for efficient electric appliances like air- and ground-source heat pumps and heat pump water heaters as well as efficiency upgrades like insulation and air sealing for low- and moderate-income households.
"Today, our groups celebrate these critical investments and encourage the swift passage of this package to secure healthier homes, address inflation, lower energy costs for households and begin to build a more just, equitable world."
