    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Clay (D) MO and 136 others)
The administration strongly opposes H.R. 281. If H.R. 281 were presented to the President, the President's senior advisers would recommend disapproval.
H.R. 281 would apply the terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employees of one construction business entity to cover the employees of another. This so-called "double-breasting" provision would in effect deprive the employees of their right to decide whether they want to be represented by a union, and if so, to select the union of their choice. The bill is also objectionable because it contains a provision relating to pre-hire agreements that would apply the agreement and union representation to employees without allowing them to seek an election during the term of the agreement. The provision would also require the employer to continue to bargain with the union after the termination of the pre-hire agreement even though the employees had never selected that union as their representative.
