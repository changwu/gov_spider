    Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen:
As our joint communiqu√© indicates, President Thieu and I have had very constructive talks with regard to how we shall work together in the years ahead, working for the program of peace which we now hope will all be the wave of the future, not only for the Republic of Vietnam but for all of the countries in Indochina.
Mr. President, we have been allies in a long and difficult war, and now you can be sure that we stand with you as we continue to work together to build a lasting peace.
This is a great goal for our two peoples, and I am very happy that we could have had these extended talks in developing programs that will achieve that goal.
We wish you well as you go on to Washington and as you return to your own country, and we look forward to the time when we shall meet again.
