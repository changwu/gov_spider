On a recent visit to Arizona, I toured the proving grounds of manufacturing giant Caterpillar. Under President Trump's administration, this iconic American business has been booming, but to keep this momentum going — for Caterpillar and businesses across the country — we've got to open more markets for selling U.S. products. That's why I'm urging all Arizonans to call on Congress to pass the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
...
The USMCA is a state-of-the-art trade deal, and if it becomes the law of the land it could serve as a template for trade deals in the future. According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add more than $68 billion to our economy and create another 176,000 American jobs. That includes nearly 50,000 good manufacturing jobs like those at Caterpillar.
And so, for Arizona, for the manufacturing industry, and for America, we've got to get this done. Mexico has already ratified the USMCA, and Canada is ready to move as soon as we do. It's time for Congress to act.
