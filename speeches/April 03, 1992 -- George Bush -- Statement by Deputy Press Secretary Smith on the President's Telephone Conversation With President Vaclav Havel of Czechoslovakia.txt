    The President spoke by telephone for 15 minutes this morning with Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, who had just returned from a state visit to Russia. They concurred on the critical need to galvanize international support for President Yeltsin and the Government of the Russian Federation.
Specifically, they agreed that the success of the Russian Government's landmark economic reform program was vitally important for peace and stability in Europe. Pointing to the package of economic measures he announced on April 1, the President assured President Havel of the firm U.S. resolve to assist the Russian Government and other reform-minded States in the former U.S.S.R.
