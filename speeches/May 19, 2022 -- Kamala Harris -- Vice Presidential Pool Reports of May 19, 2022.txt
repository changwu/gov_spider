VP Pool Report #1
Hi everyone,
I'll be your pooler for the VP's third event of the day. The VP will give opening remarks before she will virtually meet with abortion providers. The remarks will be livestreamed at https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
The meeting is scheduled for 2:05pm in the South Court Auditorium.
On Background from a White House Official 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris will virtually meet with abortion providers at the White House. The Vice President will provide opening remarks, followed by a conversation with the providers. They will be joined by advocates in the audience.
The Vice President will hear stories from abortion providers who are working in states with some of the most extreme abortion restrictions, and she will thank them for fighting to protect reproductive health care, despite personal risk. Vice President Harris will emphasize that the Administration will continue to defend women's constitutional rights and protect access to abortion. The Vice President's opening remarks will be livestreamed at www.whitehouse.gov/live.
Confirmed Participants 

Dr. Rebecca Taub, OB/GYN practicing in California, Oklahoma, and Kansas
Dr. Bhavik Kumar, OB/GYN with Planned Parenthood practicing in Texas
Dr. Colleen McNicholas, Chief Medical Officer for Planned Parenthood of St. Louis, Missouri
Helen Weems, MSN, RN, APRN, Founder and Director, All Families Healthcare (Montana)

Additional Background

Vice President Harris is a longtime champion of protecting reproductive rights and access to abortions.
She is a longtime supporter of codifying Roe in federal legislation. Last week, she presided over the Senate's vote on the Women's Health Protection Act.
In September, the Vice President met with abortion and reproductive health providers and patients at the White House to discuss the impact of Texas Senate Bill 8 and other restrictions on reproductive health. The Vice President emphasized this issue is a critical priority for the Administration, and she thanked the providers and activists who are fighting to protect reproductive choice in their states.
The Vice President has spent her career fighting for women's health, safety, and wellbeing.

As California Attorney General, she signed onto multiple amicus briefs to ensure women have full access to their reproductive health care.


The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to promote and protect women's reproductive rights:

This Administration has made historic commitments to advancing gender equality, including standing up the White House's first-ever Gender Policy Council, dedicated to driving a whole-of-government effort that is advancing gender equity and equality, from championing women's access to high quality and equitable health care; to women's rights, equal opportunities and pay, equal protection, and safety from gender-based harassment and violence.
The President and Vice President have continued to stand side by side with women to protect and defend the long-recognized, constitutional right to safe and legal abortion.
In response to SB 8, the President and Vice President strongly denounced the law as an affront to a woman's constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade. The President and Vice President directed the Gender Policy Council and White House Counsel to lead a whole-of-government effort to protect women's rights across this country.
The Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to speak out as extremist Republican leaders are weaponizing the use of the law in states across the country to punish and control women.


The Vice President will continue to work with Members of Congress, state advocates and legislators, stakeholders, and those on the frontlines of the fight to protect reproductive rights.
