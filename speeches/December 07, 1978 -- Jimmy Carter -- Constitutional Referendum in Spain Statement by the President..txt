    All people who love freedom and believe in democracy won a victory in Spain yesterday.
The Spanish electorate decisively approved in a national referendum the draft democratic constitution placed before them by their elected parliamentary representatives. This occasion marks the culmination of courageous and determined efforts by the Spanish people, their representatives, and King Juan Carlos to establish a framework for Spanish democracy which meets with the approval of all Spaniards.
The success of the transition to democracy in Spain, and the manifest will of Spaniards across the political spectrum to establish a democratic system, have earned the admiration of people the world over who share similar ideals.
Yesterday's referendum symbolizes a remarkable and praiseworthy achievement. We want to congratulate the Spanish people on this occasion, and to reaffirm the hope and support of the American people and their government for continued success in this historic effort.
