One gimmick might keep insurers in the game: The law's "risk corridor" provision allowed Washington to tax profitable exchange plans to prop up unprofitable ones.
But even in Year One, there weren't enough profits to cover the losses â€” so Team Obama transferred money from elsewhere.
This subsidy was entirely distinct from the law's support for lower-income folks: It was a bailout for the companies. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put a stop to that last year, passing an amendment that prevents these back-door bailouts.
Without the extra taxpayer dollars, the administration can only deliver about 13 percent of the bailout cash needed this year. So it can't save the money-bleeding nonprofit "co-ops" the law set up either. More than half these nonprofits have failed already.

Marco pinpointed the problem with Obamacare years ago: It simply won't work unless we bail out the insurance companies that bought into the doomed law..

Marco stopped the bailout once, and now he is leading the fight to end these bailouts for good.
