    Today, I have signed into law S. 1595, the "Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018" (the "Act"). Sections 101 and 201 purport to require the President to deny certain aliens entry into the United States, without a sufficient exception for the exercise of the President's responsibility to receive ambassadors under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution. Section 104 purports to direct negotiations with foreign governments or to require the Executive to adopt a particular foreign policy. My Administration supports the diplomatic initiatives described in the Act but will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities in the area of foreign relations.
DONALD J. TRUMP
