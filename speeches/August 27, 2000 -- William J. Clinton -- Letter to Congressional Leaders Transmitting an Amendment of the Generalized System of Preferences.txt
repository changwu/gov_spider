    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit a Proclamation in which I have determined that it is appropriate to grant preferential treatment for Nigeria as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP benefits must be granted to Nigeria before that nation can receive further trade benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Public Law 106-200).
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
