    I have signed a proclamation suspending the entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of all persons—and the spouses, children, and parents of all persons—who plan, engage in, or benefit from activities that support the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) or that otherwise impede the peace process in Sierra Leone. These visa restrictions will immediately apply to President Charles Taylor, senior members of the Government of Liberia, their closest supporters, and their family members.
I call upon the Liberian Government to end immediately Liberia's trafficking in weapons and illicit diamonds, which fuels the war in Sierra Leone, and instead to use its influence with the RUF to restore peace and stability to Sierra Leone. Members of my administration have repeatedly made this request of President Taylor. The absence of any positive response from his government leaves us little choice but to impose these restrictions. Only when the Government of Liberia ends its participation in activities that support the RUF will the United States review this policy.
