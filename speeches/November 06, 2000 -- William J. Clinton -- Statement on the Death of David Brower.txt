    I was saddened to learn today of the death of David Brower, one of the earliest and most ardent defenders of the extraordinary natural heritage that enriches and unites all Americans. Over more than half a century, from Cape Cod to the Grand Canyon to the Alaska wilderness, he fought passionately to preserve our Nation's greatest natural treasures. His fiery activism helped build and energize the modern environmental movement, rallying countless people to the defense of our precious planet. Like the towering redwoods of his native California, David Brower's conservation legacy will stand tall and proud for generations to come.
Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Anne, his family, and his many friends and supporters throughout the world.
