I will help Angel Mom (and great woman) Mary Ann Mendoza with Twitter. I know Mary Ann from the beginning and she should never be silenced. She is a winner who has lost so much her child. Twitter if you're watching please do what you have to do NOW! @foxandfriendsRetweets: 30753Favorites: 114019

The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. When I became President it was practically shut down and closed for business. Not anymore!Retweets: 18037Favorites: 91508

The Washington Post Story about my speech in North Carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is Fake News. The only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the Democrats. You'll see in 2020!Retweets: 18040Favorites: 79846

I don't believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party but are weak & insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!Retweets: 41095Favorites: 183231
