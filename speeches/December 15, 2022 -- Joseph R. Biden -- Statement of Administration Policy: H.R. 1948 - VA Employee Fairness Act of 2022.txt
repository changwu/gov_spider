    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Takano, D-CA, and 218 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1948, the VA Employee Fairness Act of 2022, to expand collective bargaining opportunities for covered Federal employees.
The Biden-Harris Administration supports worker organizing and empowerment as critical tools to grow the middle class and build an inclusive economy. The Federal government, consistent with its obligations to serve the public, can be a model employer in this regard.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for the delivery of safe, effective, and timely patient care for our veterans, and dedicated VA employees work tirelessly to support our veterans' health needs, including in combating COVID-19.
The Administration is committed to continuing to work with Congress to support hard-working employees while protecting veterans' access to the care and services that they have earned through service to the Nation.
