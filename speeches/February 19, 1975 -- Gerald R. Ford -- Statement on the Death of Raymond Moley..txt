    FOR NEARLY half a century, Raymond Moley was one of the most perceptive and penetrating minds on the American political scene. As a writer and adviser to Presidents and as an author, editor, and columnist, Mr. Moley knew Washington as few other men have, going back to the early days of Franklin Roosevelt's administration.
Mr. Moley was also a scholar--a man of reflection as well as action--and his sense of balance and historical perspective led him to oppose political extremes in either direction. In his long and active life, he excelled both as a practitioner and an analyst of the political process.
Mrs. Ford and I extend our sympathy to Mrs. Moley and the Moley family on the loss of this distinguished American.
