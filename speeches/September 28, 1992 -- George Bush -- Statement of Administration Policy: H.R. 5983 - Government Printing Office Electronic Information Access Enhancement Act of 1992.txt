    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rose (D) North Carolina and 2 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5983, and will seek a Senate amendment to state expressly the bill's effect on the authorities of the Public Printer. The amendment would clarify that the bill does not authorize conditions or requirements on the creation, dissemination, or use of Federal electronic information or electronic directories by Federal agencies or the public.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA) requires that all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as- you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in an increase in the deficit; and if it does, it will trigger a sequester if it is not fully offset. Offsetting collections in this bill would recover costs of information dissemination, resulting in a net zero PAYGO effect. Thus, considered alone, this bill meets the PAYGO requirement of OBRA.
