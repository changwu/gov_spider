    Expanded Northern Headquarters Brings Additional Space for Organizing, Volunteer Activities
With hundreds of volunteers and a growing staff of organizers working throughout the state, Hillary Clinton's Nevada campaign today opened expanded offices in Reno. The new office more than triples available space for volunteer activities, organizing meetings, phone banking and other campaign efforts.
The new office is located at 1475 Terminal Way, Suite B (corner of Terminal and Villanova, next to the Democratic Party headquarters) â€“ in the same office complex as the campaign's previous northern Nevada headquarters, which opened in May. Volunteers and those interested in learning more about campaign activities in northern Nevada may utilize the same office phone number, (775) 333-6655.
Last week, the Clinton campaign opened a new office in the rural community of Pahrump.
"So many people throughout Nevada are excited about Hillary Clinton - her message of change, and the unmatched experience she will bring to our nation as president," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "Our Reno office has been packed seven days a week with an enthusiastic and growing corps of volunteers supporting the Nevada campaign, and this new office will provide a great base of operations for expanding outreach to northern communities."
