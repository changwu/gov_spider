    "Throughout the last few days, we held constructive meetings on behalf of President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden with delegations to the G-20 summit from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Commission, France (via phone call), Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and with the Secretary General of the United Nations.
"The President-elect believes that the G-20 summit of leaders from the world's largest economies is an important opportunity to seek a coordinated response to the global financial crisis. There is one President at a time, so the President-elect asked us to represent him in receiving the views of these important partners. We also conveyed President-elect Obama's determination to continuing to work together on these challenges after he takes office in January.
"We will brief the President-elect and Vice President-elect at the conclusion of our meetings."
