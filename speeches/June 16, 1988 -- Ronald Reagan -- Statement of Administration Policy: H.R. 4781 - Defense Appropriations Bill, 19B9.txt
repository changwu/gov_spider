    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sponsors: Whitten (D), Mississippi; Chappell (D), Florida)
The budget authority in the Committee bill appears to be inconsistent with the Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA) in as much as it includes $410 million for the Coast Guard. While the Administration does not object to such funding for the Coast Guard, it believes this item should be funded within the domestic discretionary levels of the BBA and the $410 million restored to Defense programs.
The Administration also objects to reductions in high priority programs and the addition of funds for lower priority programs. In particular, the Administration strongly objects to:

—    A $1,338 million cut for Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) research and development. The President has stated he will veto any Defense bill that would substantially impede our ability to execute the SDI program outlined to the Congress, either because of funding cuts or restrictions; and
—    A $693 million cut for Peacekeeper rail garrison basing research and development.
