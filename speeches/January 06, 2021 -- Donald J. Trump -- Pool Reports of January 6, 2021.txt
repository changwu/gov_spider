White House in-town pool report 1/covid test
Good morning.
The pool has been tested for covid-19 and there are no updates to the schedule so far.
The president is expected to address the pro-Trump rally on the Ellipse at approximately 11 a.m. That event is expected to be televised, but your pool will send color, key quotes, etc.
A large area around the White House has been blocked for vehicle traffic.

White House in-town pool report 2/motorcade
The president's motorcade was on the move at 11:39 for the extremely short ride to the Ellipse.
The president tweeted during the delay from his expected departure but the reason for his change of schedule is unclear.
Music from the rally can be heard from outside the White House. Some upbeat Journey, Genesis and "Gloria" at top volume. Other rally playlist standards include "Candle in the Wind" and "Beat It."
The black POW-MIA flag is flying today below the U.S. flag on the pole to the rear of the White House grounds alongside the driveway that runs between the West Wing and the OEOB.

White House in-town pool report 3/ arrival
Motorcade arrived at the rally site at 11:41.
"Macho Man" playing.
Trump will speak on a stage hung with blue banners reading "Save America March."
Sizable crowd on the grass. Lots of Trump flags, some worn as capes. One guy wrapped in a yellow "Don't Tread On Me" flag.
Red, white and blue "Trump" Pom-Pom beanies are a popular hat choice.

White House in-town pool report 4/ speech
Trump took the stage at 11:57. "God Bless the U.S.A." Is playing.
Speech will be widely televised.
Pool neglected to mention that we passed newly elected Rep. Ronny Jackson on the sidewalk as we entered. He gave us a cheerful wave?.

White House in-town pool report 5/ Pence
Sorry for delay - connection problems:
Trump has again said VP Pence "has to "come through for us" by sending the election "back to the states."
Said he had just spoken to Pence and told him "it doesn't take courage" to object but it would take courage to do nothing.
Also piled on Republicans who do not join the objection and urged the crowd to "primary the hell out of the ones" who do not fight.
Critiqued McConnell over the 2k stimulus, mocked Romney.
Said the crowd would "walk down to the Capitol" and that he would be with them.
Pool has no further information on that.
Check quotes against broadcast and transcript.

White House in-town pool report 6 / more Pence and Trump says he will go to Capitol
Trump said 'we're going to walk down" to the Capitol and told the crowd he would be with them.
Your pool has no further information on that.
"Mike Pence has got to come through for us, and if he doesn't that will be a sad day."
He also said Republicans must "fight" and urged the crowd to "primary the hell out of the ones who won't."
Mentioned Romney, who was heckled at an airport. "I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in."
Trump used the word "bullshit" which set off a chant of "bullshit, bullshit, bullshit."
Reminder these are rough quotes. Check against broadcast and transcript.

White House in-town pool report 7/ rally ends

White House in-town pool report 9/Pence quote
"If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election," Trump said to cheers."He has the absolute right to do it. We're supposed to protect our country â€¦"
He said what Pence should do is:"Send it back to the states to recertify, then we become president and you are the happiest people."
"I just spoke to Mike. I said, 'that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing," he said.
Earlier, the president claimed the crowd is "hundreds of thousands" and that the media will not show the true size.
Some familiar rhetoric about the "rigged election" and blame for the news media and "Big Tech.""Last night they didn't do a bad job either," he said, apparently meaning that the Georgia runoff elections were rigged.A few quotes from near the top, and as always check quotes against broadcast and transcript:
"We will never give up, we will never concede."
"Our country has had enough we will not take it anymore that's what this is all about."After Trump said "We will not let them silence your voices," a chant of "Fight For Trump" broke out.

White House in-town pool report 10/lunch lid until 3 pm
The White House has called a lunch lid until 3 pm.
Sorry about the overlapping pool report 5, which duplicates information in other dispatches from the rally that were floating in the internet ether for awhile due to sketchy WiFi. Sorry for the any confusion.
This report is numbered 10 to get us back on track.



January 6, 202115:12

White House in-town pool report 11 / no updates at White House
The White House is busy but calm, with no developments here. Obviously things are different at the Capitol.
The Marine was outside the Oval Office entrance at 2:35 p.m., roughly when he sent this tweet:
"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!"
I'll send out periodic updates from here, but as of now there is nothing further on the president's schedule for today.
