    House Majority Leader Eric Cantor made the following statement today on the controversy surrounding the Democratic Party platform: 
"President Obama's failure to take a coherent and decisive stand in recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel reflects his Administration's vacillating policies toward the Jewish state. Today's floor fight and begrudging platform reversal at the Democratic National Convention should be seen for what it is – a case study in political posturing.  Governor Romney's views stand in sharp contrast to the President's. Governor Romney strongly believes that Israel is our most important ally in the Middle East and that support for Israel is essential to extending freedom, peace and democracy throughout the region. As president, Governor Romney will restore and protect the close alliance between our nation and the state of Israel."
