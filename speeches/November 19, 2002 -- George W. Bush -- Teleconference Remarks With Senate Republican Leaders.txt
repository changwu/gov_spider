The President. Well, I appreciate that, Trent. And I want to thank you all for working hard. We're making great progress in the war on terror. Part of that progress will be the ability for us to protect the American people at home. This is a very important piece of legislation. It is landmark in its scope, and it ends a session which has been 2 years' worth of legislative work, which has been very productive for the American people.
Senator Lott. [Inaudible]
The President. Well, I want to thank you all. It is an honor to be representing the greatest country on the face of the Earth over in Europe. And we're going to have an historic day on Thursday when we go to expand NATO. The people of Europe appreciate America. They appreciate our strength, and most importantly, they appreciate our compassion and our love for freedom. And I know you all share that side of America with me.
Again, I want to thank all the Senators in the room there for your hard work and look forward to seeing you when I get back.
