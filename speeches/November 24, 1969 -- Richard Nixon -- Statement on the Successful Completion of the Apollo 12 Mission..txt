    ANOTHER CHAPTER in the history of American exploration has ended successfully. I extend the congratulations of all Americans to the crew of Apollo 12 and to the thousands who made its success possible. This mission has shown conclusively that the system we have developed has enormous scientific potential, and we can now look forward to utilizing that capability.
We have all been impressed over the last several days with both the technical proficiency and the high spirits of Commander Conrad, Commander Gordon, and Commander Bean.
The triumph of Apollo 12 is not only an American triumph. This second voyage to the surface of the moon represents another great victory of the human mind and spirit, one which will lift the sights and raise the spirits of men everywhere.
