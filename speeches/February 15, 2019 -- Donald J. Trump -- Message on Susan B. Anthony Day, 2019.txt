    Today we commemorate the birthday of Susan B. Anthony, an American champion of civil liberties and women's rights. Susan B. Anthony was a steadfast advocate for the founding principles of our Nation. She advocated tirelessly for life, liberty, and equality for all Americans, regardless of sex, and she is best remembered for her role in the women's suffrage movement. The right to vote for women was enshrined in the Constitution with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.
Susan B. Anthony's crusade for equal rights has benefitted every subsequent generation of Americans. Since her death in 1906, women and minorities in every realm of commerce, culture, and industry have shattered barriers and made indelible contributions to our country's security, prosperity, and way of life. Today, more women and minorities are serving in Congress than ever before, and in every facet of society, women are role models and innovators, inspiring others to pursue their dreams without hesitation.
We must also never forget that Susan B. Anthony's pursuit for equal rights demands respect for all human life, including innocent unborn babies. We must cherish innocent life, secure equal rights for all people, and relentlessly extend those protections to our most vulnerable.
On this day, we honor the legacy and accomplishments of Susan B. Anthony. Her tireless dedication to the empowerment of women changed the course of our Nation's history. We celebrate the immeasurable achievements of women throughout our history and reaffirm our commitment to advancing equal opportunity for all Americans.
