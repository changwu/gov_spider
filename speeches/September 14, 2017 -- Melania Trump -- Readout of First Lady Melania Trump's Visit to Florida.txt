    First Lady Melania Trump flew to Florida today to visit with first responders and families affected by the damage resulting from Hurricane Irma. Upon landing in Ft. Myers, the President and Mrs. Trump met with first responders from all over the State, and received a briefing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and State and local officials.
After the briefing, the First Lady took an aerial tour of Naples, Florida to view the flooding and damage before meeting with families who lost their homes. Once on the ground, the First Lady, the President, and the Vice President took a walking tour of a neighborhood particularly damaged in the storm. They stopped and visited with families, listening to their stories, concerns, and most pressing needs â€“ ice, gas, and power.
The First Lady then distributed lunch alongside FEMA officials and volunteers.
First Lady Melania Trump said, "We have certainly seen the unforgiving side of Mother Nature these past few weeks, and my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families so deeply affected by both Harvey and Irma. I will continue to receive updates from FEMA, and lend my voice, time, and resources to help those who need it most."
