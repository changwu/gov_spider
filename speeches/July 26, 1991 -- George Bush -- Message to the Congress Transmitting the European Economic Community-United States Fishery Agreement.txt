    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Economic Community Amending and Extending the Agreement of October 1, 1984, Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, as amended and extended. The agreement, which was effected by exchange of notes at Washington and Brussels on February 1 and June 14, 1991, copies of which are attached, extends the 1984 agreement for an additional 2 years and 6 months, from July 1, 1991, to December 31, 1993. The exchange of notes together with the 1984 agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of section 201(c) of the Act. The exchange of notes also amends the 1984 agreement to incorporate the latest changes in U.S. law and policy.
U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement to avoid disruption of ongoing cooperative fishing ventures. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
George Bush
The White House,
