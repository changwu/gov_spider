    I commend the Massachusetts Legislature for standing up for working men and women in the Commonwealth and taking action toward raising the State's minimum wage to $11 per hour by 2017. Under the leadership of Governor Patrick, Massachusetts joins a growing coalition of States, cities, and counties that are doing part to make sure no American working full time has to support a family in poverty.
I look forward to Governor Patrick signing this bill into law soon, and I urge Congress to follow Massachusetts' lead and lift wages for 28 million Americans by raising the Federal minimum wage to $10.10.
