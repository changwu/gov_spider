    LAS VEGAS – Bernie 2020 announced today that educators, education leaders and college professors from five counties across Nevada are endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president of the United States. The announcement comes as the campaign recently reported its $34.5 million fourth quarter fundraising haul, with "teacher" being the most common occupation for donors. This haul includes more than 500 new educators donating to the campaign in the final quarter of 2019.
"Any grassroots movement is incomplete without the support of educators, who are instrumental in securing a prosperous future for the next generation," Bernie 2020 Nevada State Director Sarah Michelsen said. "We are honored by their endorsements, and we know how important this is as we look ahead to the February caucuses. We look forward to working side-by-side with them to win Nevada for Bernie, to make our education system more equitable, and to expand educational opportunities for Nevada's youth."
