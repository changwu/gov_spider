    Boston, MA — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"This election is a choice between two very different visions for our nation's future. But absent a record to run on or a plan for the future, President Obama has begun grasping for straws. Pennsylvanians have realized that President Obama does not know how to create jobs, and creating a new government position — a Secretary of Business — is not the answer. Mitt Romney understands what Pennsylvanians need — real leadership for a real recovery. His leadership and job-creating experience is what has won Pennsylvanians over. Mitt Romney will win Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania will put him in the White House."
