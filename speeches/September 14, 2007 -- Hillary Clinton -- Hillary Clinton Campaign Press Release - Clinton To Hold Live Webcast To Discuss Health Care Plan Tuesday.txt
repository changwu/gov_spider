    Will Field Questions From Americans Across The Country
Hillary Clinton will hold a live interactive webcast on Tuesday, September 18, to discuss her new health care plan that will provide affordable, quality coverage for all Americans. Clinton will outline her plan and answer live questions from across the country at 8 p.m. EDT at www.hillaryclinton.com.
Throughout the campaign, Clinton has engaged Americans in new and innovative ways. She launched her candidacy with an online announcement and held a series of live video webcasts with tens of thousands of voters. Since then, she has announced the winner of her campaign song contest in a wildly popular web video and posted HillCast web videos on a range of policy proposals. The campaign has also launched www.HillaryHub.com to serve as a central repository for news, blogs and videos about Hillary's candidacy.
