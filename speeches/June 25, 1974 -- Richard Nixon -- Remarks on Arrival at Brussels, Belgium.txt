    Your Majesty, Mr. Secretary, and all of our distinguished guests:
Your Majesty, I wish to express our grateful appreciation for your gracious welcome, and also for your eloquent words with regard to the hopes we all share for building a structure of peace in the world.
And it is indeed an honor for me to join with my colleagues in the Atlantic Alliance in tomorrow reaffirming our dedication to the great principles of that alliance. What we must all recognize is that the Atlantic Alliance has been indispensable in keeping the peace in Europe for the past 25 years.
As you have noted, this visit to Brussels comes midway between two other visits, the first to the Mideast and the next to the Soviet Union. It is significant that this is the case, because this symbolizes the central role that the Atlantic Alliance plays in pursuing our goal of a lasting peace in the world. Without the Alliance, it is doubtful that the detente would have begun, and without continuing a strong alliance, it is doubtful if the detente would continue.
It is also very significant that this meeting will take place in Brussels, now the capital of Europe, and in Belgium, a nation which has suffered so much in two World Wars. And I am sure that all of those attending the meeting tomorrow will have in their hearts these sentiments that we wish that whatever we do there and whatever decisions we make and whatever we say may contribute to the goal we seek, not only for each of our own countries but for all nations in the world, a peace that will last.
