    The people of the United States join Indonesians in mourning the death of former President Abdurrahman Wahid. A pivotal figure in Indonesia's transition to democracy, President Wahid will be remembered for his commitment to democratic principles, inclusive politics, and religious tolerance. He worked for peace and prosperity for all Indonesians, and he sought to be a bridge between people of different faiths. We extend our deepest condolences to former President Wahidâ€™s family and to the people of Indonesia.
