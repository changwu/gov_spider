    Tonight, in response to Donald Trump's statement of regret from his prepared remarks, HFA Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds offered the following statement:
"Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people. He has continued to do so through each of the 428 days from then until now, without shame or regret. We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying and divisive comments he regrets—and changes his tune altogether."
