WH in-town pool report #1: Day ahead 
Good morning, I'll be your print pooler at the White House today. President Biden will meet this afternoon with the family of George Floyd, though it is closed press as of now. The president will also make a quick trip to Delaware this evening for what is billed only as a "local stop."
Press secretary Jen Psaki will hold a briefing at 12:30. If you're unable to be in the room but have a question you want answered, feel free to send it along and I'll do my best to ask it.
Finally, flagging for those who missed it: From a White House official: Today, the United States will reach 50% of American adults fully vaccinated.
Feel free to reach out with any questions!

Philonise Floyd said it was a "great" meeting. Called Biden a genuine guy and expressed appreciation for the opportunity to meet.
Rodney Floyd: "Today is about the remembrance of our brother George Floyd."
The speakers each addressed the need to pass police reform. They all raises their fists at one point, said "say his name," and said "George Floyd" in unison.
Crump was asked about GOP desire for buy in from policing organizations and the debate over qualified immunity.
Crump said the group was going to meet with Booker and Scott to continue to talk about a bipartisan bill.
"We don't think it was to be one against the other. It should be that we all want better policing," he said.
"This is an American issue. This isn't a police issue or a civil rights issue, Crump said.

WH in-town pool report #10: Full Floyd family remarks 
Video of the full remarks is available here: https://www.c-span.org/video/?512081-1/george-floyd-family-members-speak...
Some fuller quotes from family members:
Ben Crump said the meeting lasted for more than an hour. "I know the president was very personal because he got to know this family over the years, and he wanted to check on them on today of all days to see how they were doing. To reiterate that they are still doing everything to make sure that his legacy is respected, and that involves us going to meet with senators in just a few moments to continue to press forward for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that he says he is ready to sign any day.
"He said that he doesn't want to sign a bill that doesn't have substance and meaning. So he is going to be patient to make sure it's the right bill, not a rushed bill."
"Also the family encouraged the president to continue to meet with the civil rights leaders and advocacy groups who have been working on this for decades," Crump said, citing leaders of the NAACP, the Urban League and others.
Philonise Floyd: "We met with the president and the VP. It was just for the remembrance of what happened to my brother. Because this was his day that he was murdered. It was great. He's a genuine guy. They always speak from the heart, and it's a pleasure just to be able to have a chance to meet with them when we have the opportunity to.
We're just thankful for what's going on and we just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future.
"If you can make federal laws to protect the bird which is the Bald Eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of color."
Rodney Floyd said the day is about "the remembrance of our brother George Floyd. Father, uncle, friend, cousin, and Mr. President and Vice President gave us their condolences just keeping up and touching back on what happened last year, reiterating everything. They asked us how we were doing. Are we taking care of ourselves... and asked us all about how we're feeling and what's going on today about our brother. And we're thankful that they showed great concern."
Terrence Floyd: "Being here today is an honor. To meet with the president and the vice president and for them to show their concern to our family and for them to actually give an ear to our concerns and how we feel on the situation. I feel it was a very productive conversation, and I'm grateful for it."
Brandon Williams, George Floyd's nephew: I think that the meeting went well. He showed concern, and I think genuinely he wanted to know exactly how we were doing and what he could do to support us."
Biden told the family he's "not happy" about the deadline for the legislation not being met, but wants to make sure it's the right bill and that it "holds George's legacy intact."

WH in-town pool report #11: Gathering for Biden departure 
In-town pool is gathering for President Biden's departure from the Ellipse to Delaware Air National Guard Base in Wilmington.



May 25, 202117:26

WH in-town pool report #12: Biden departure and Q&A 
President Biden arrived at the Ellipse via motorcade at 5:15 p.m. He spoke to the pool for four minutes before boarding Marine One. He addressed his meeting with the Floyd family, policing reform talks, Nord Stream 2, Belarus and infrastructure talks.
On infrastructure, he laughed and said he doesn’t negotiate in public. On policing reform he said he’d spoken with negotiators on the issue. And asked about possible sanctions on Belarus he said they were in play but that he didn’t want to speculate.
I will send fuller quotes ASAP.
Marine One lifted off at 5:25 and flew away into the distance. Handing off to the out-of-town pool.

WH in-town pool report #13: Fuller Biden quotes 
Fuller quotes from Biden's gaggle with reporters before departing from Delaware. As always, check against the official transcript as it was difficult to hear with the helicopter in the background:
He said he's making the trip to Wilmington to attend the funeral of a long-time former staffer.
On meeting with the Floyd family:
"I got a chance to spend a lot of time with Gianna and the family, and we just talked about- you know, it's the one-year anniversary. And those of you that have been through personal loss know that although every anniversary is, you're happy people remember, it also brings everything back immediately like it happened that day. It takes a lot of courage to go through it. And they've been wonderful."
Asked specifically about George Floyd's young daughter, Gianna, Biden said the first thing she did was run to him and give him a hug, then asked for snacks. Gianna had Cheetos and milk (possibly chocolate milk) during the visit to the White House, he said.
"My wife's going to kill me," he joked after listing the snacks.
Biden said he's spoken with negotiators on policing reform and he's "hopeful that after Memorial Day" there will be a potential deal.
On Nord Stream 2: Biden said he opposed the project "from the beginning" but noted it's almost completed at this point.
"To go ahead and impose sanctions now would, I think, be counterproductive in terms of our European relations. They know how strongly I feel."
On infrastructure talks: "I never negotiate in public."
On possible Belarus sanctions: "That's in play. I don't want to speculate until we get it done."

WH in-town pool report #13: Biden return and lid 
Marine One landed on the Ellipse just outside the White House complex at 9:28 p.m. Biden disembarked and gave a quick wave to the pool but walked to his awaiting motorcade without stopping to speak to reporters. The motorcade drove off at 9:32 p.m.
With that, we have a travel/photo lid. Have a good evening, everyone.
