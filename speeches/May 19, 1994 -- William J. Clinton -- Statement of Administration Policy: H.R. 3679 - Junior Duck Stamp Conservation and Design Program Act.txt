    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/20/94)(House)(Ortiz (D) TX and 9 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 3679.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3679 would affect direct spending and receipts and is, therefore, subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
