    Today, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met with 16 CEOs of major companies across several industries including energy, food, and manufacturing to provide a briefing on the latest developments on Putin's unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine. The President joined for part of the discussion. They conveyed the Administration's commitment to continue imposing heavy costs on Putin to degrade Russia's war machine and support the people of Ukraine, while taking concrete actions to mitigate the price increases on American consumers caused by Putin's action. Participants also discussed the need to work together to address Putin's disruptions to global markets and supply chains, especially for energy and agricultural commodities, and identify alternative sources of supply for key goods. The private sector and the Administration committed to close communication and coordination going forward.
