    Today well-known Silicon Valley entrepreneur and former California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner endorsed Governor John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America leadership team as California state chairman and a national co-chair. Poizner will play an active role in formulating campaign strategy throughout the primary process, as well as in California during the general election, where his counsel will contribute to Kasich being very competitive.
Poizner pioneered GPS technology in cell phones, founding SnapTrack, Inc. in 1995, which was later acquired by Qualcomm. He was an advisor to the White House National Security Council on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection from 2001 to 2002 and was the elected California Insurance Commissioner from 2007 to 2011. Poizner is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations and was selected for the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame in 2014.
Said Poizner, "The next President needs to be able to hit the ground running on Day One, and John Kasich's tested executive leadership, national security experience and proven ability to bring people together to create needed change will let him do that. I've watched with respect as he's successfully worked with job creators to help Ohioans turn around their state and successfully led efforts to rein-in and reform Washingtonâ€”all while being a unifying, positive voice. It's the right mix and I'm proud to join John Kasich's team."
Said Kasich, "Steve Poizner is one of the people who invents the future everyday. His kind of leadership in public policy, in business and in technology is what makes America strong and creates opportunity. It's extremely humbling to earn his endorsement and I look forward to continue building our momentum nationwide with his counsel and support."
