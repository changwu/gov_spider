    McLean, VA - Today the Thompson Campaign announced the endorsement of 58 current and former Republican State Legislators. Thompson has more support among Republican legislators in Georgia than all other GOP Presidential candidates combined.
"All across the country, real conservative leaders like these Georgia legislators are rallying to Senator Thompson and his proven conservative leadership. We are proud to have their support," said Randy Enwright, Thompson's National Political Director.
"Because the Georgia General Assembly represents all corners of our great state, it is one of the most effective grassroots organizations around," says State Senator Chip Rogers, the Executive Director of the Thompson Campaign in Georgia. "Senator Thompson's consistent conservative record and commitment to the principles of federalism has earned him the support of these leaders."
"The response to Senator Thompson has been electric," said Thompson's Georgia Grassroots Chairman John Bozeman. "These guys are excited to put their entire political organizations to work for Fred Thompson."
The most recent opinion poll shows Senator Thompson with a strong lead among GOP voters in Georgia. According to a Strategic Vision survey of 800 likely voters, taken October 19-21, Thompson leads with 39% ahead of Rudy Giuliani at 20%. No other candidate had more than 9% support. With 72 delegates at stake, the Georgia Republican Presidential Preference Primary to be held on Tuesday, February 5th will have a significant impact on determining the eventual GOP nominee.
