    Today, in the United States and in nations near and far, we celebrate the valuable contributions and inherent dignity of people with disabilities. This year's theme for International Day of Persons With Disabilities—transformation toward a sustainable and resilient society for all—underscores the importance of removing societal barriers that diminish opportunities for people with disabilities and their families.
My administration is committed to expanding opportunities for Americans with disabilities. In June, I signed an Executive order to expand apprenticeship programs, giving more people—including those with disabilities—access to the relevant skills and tools needed to secure good jobs. Through technological advancements, job training and educational opportunities, and increased engagement from business and community leaders, people with disabilities will continue to enrich our Nation and our world in new and innovative ways.
Today we rededicate our efforts to uphold the principles of human dignity, empowerment, and opportunity for all. Too many people around the world hold the misguided view that disabilities justify degrading or destroying precious human lives or that people with disabilities should not be entitled to full participation in civic life. This way of thinking will always be morally wrong and contrary to our Nation's core values. As Americans, we must set the global standard for ensuring those with disabilities are treated with the dignity and respect that all people deserve. Working with other nations, we will advance the rights of people with disabilities around the world.
