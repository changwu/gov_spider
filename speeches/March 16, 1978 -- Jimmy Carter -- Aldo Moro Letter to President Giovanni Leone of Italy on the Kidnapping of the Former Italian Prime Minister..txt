    Dear Mr. President:
I was shocked to hear of the terrorist kidnapping of Aldo Moro. I know that millions of Americans join me in praying for his quick and safe return. This outrage deeply affects all of us. Please convey my personal sympathies to the Moro family and to the families of the brave men slain in the line of duty in this senseless terrorist attack.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
