    SANTA FE-- Governor Bill Richardson announced today that New Mexico ranked 11th among all states in a Mothers Against Drunk Driving "State Progress Report" in the battle against drunk driving.
"I am pleased that MADD's report reflects the progress we have made here in New Mexico to combat drunk driving," said Governor Richardson. "We are working tirelessly to fight DWI and we are seeing the results, but there is still more work to be done."
MADD's report ranks states based on their percent of total traffic fatalities that involve a drunk driver. In 2006, 28 percent of New Mexico's traffic fatalities involved a drunk driver.
The report also provides each state's drunk driving fatalities and highlights efforts to pass ignition interlock laws, as well as their status on sobriety checkpoints. While sobriety checkpoints are used extensively in New Mexico, MADD reports that eleven states do not allow law enforcement agencies to use checkpoints. Five states - Alabama, Hawaii, Maine, South Dakota and Vermont - have no interlock laws.
New Mexico DWI Czar Rachel O'Connor said, "I want to thank Mothers Against Drunk Driving for recognizing the efforts New Mexico has made on DWI. I would also like to credit the many citizens who have joined the fight against DWI by dialing the 'DrunkBuster' hotline and reporting suspected drunk drivers to law enforcement. The hotline, combined with our DWI enforcement program and our 'You Drink, You Drive, You Lose' public awareness campaign are helping reduce DWI in New Mexico, but we know DWI remains a critical public safety issue."
Transportation Secretary Rhonda Faught added, "It's great to see an organization such as MADD highlight New Mexico' progress against drunk driving. Too many lives are needlessly lost each year to DWI, and I want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that drunk driving is simply not tolerated in our state."
