I AM SHOCKED to learn of the sudden death of Miss Van Rensselaer. Her passing will bring a sense of personal loss to thousands from whom her quiet devotion to every cause looking to the well-being of children and to the enrichment of the life of women had evoked their warm affection and their deep respect. I wish especially to pay tribute to her great services in the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, and in the President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership. The Nation has lost a great citizen, and all who knew her a loyal friend.
