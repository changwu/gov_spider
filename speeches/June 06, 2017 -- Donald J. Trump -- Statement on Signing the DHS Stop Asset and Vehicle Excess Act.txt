    H.R. 366, the "DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act," would assign responsibility for achieving optimal vehicle fleet size in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to the Under Secretary for Management (the Under Secretary). I am pleased to sign this bill and applaud this legislative effort to eliminate waste. One provision of the bill, however, purports to require the Under Secretary to recommend budget rescissions to the Congress if the Under Secretary determines that DHS component heads have not taken adequate steps to achieve optimal vehicle fleet size in the previous fiscal year. My Administration, including the Under Secretary, will respectfully treat the provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President the exclusive authority to "recommend" to the Congress spending "Measures" in such amounts and for such purposes "as he shall judge necessary and expedient." My Administration, including the Under Secretary, looks forward to working with the Congress to identify and implement proposals to eliminate wasteful spending.
