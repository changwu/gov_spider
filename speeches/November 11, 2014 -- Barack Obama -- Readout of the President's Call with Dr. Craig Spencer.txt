    The President spoke by phone from Beijing, China on Wednesday morning with Dr. Craig Spencer, an American healthcare worker who contracted Ebola while working to combat the disease in Guinea. The President called Dr. Spencer, who on Tuesday was released from Bellevue Hospital in New York City after being declared Ebola-free, to herald his recovery. The President commended Dr. Spencer for his selflessness and compassion in fighting this disease on the frontlines in West Africa. The President underscored that his administration would continue to support those who—similar to Dr. Spencer—wish to act on that admirable commitment to serve others. The President noted that the most effective way to protect against Ebola cases at home is to continue to fight the disease at its source, and he thanked Dr. Spencer for his service to his country and to the people of West Africa.
