    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/28/94)(Markey (D) Massachusetts and 11 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2448.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2448 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. This Office estimates the pay-as-you-go effect is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
