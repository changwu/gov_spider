    This morning, the President and the Vice President hosted the bipartisan, bicameral leadership of Congress in the Cabinet Room. The leaders discussed a wide range of issues, and the President highlighted areas where Republicans and Democrats can work together to protect our national security and continue the progress we have seen in the economy. The President underscored there are priorities that rise above politics â€“ including keeping Americans safe by promptly and fully funding the Department of Homeland Security without delay so the men and women working there can operate with the confidence they need, and working together to pass legislation to combat the cyber security threats we face. The President committed to working with members of both parties on text for an AUMF that Congress can pass to show the world America stands united against ISIL. The President also underscored the importance of our diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, reiterating his strong opposition to additional sanctions legislation that could derail the negotiations and isolate the United States from our international coalition. Coming off the strongest year for private-sector job growth since the 1990s, the President asked that leaders from both parties work together to build on our growth. The President looks forward to working with Congress to make progress for the middle class, and ensure every American feels like they're part of their country's comeback.
