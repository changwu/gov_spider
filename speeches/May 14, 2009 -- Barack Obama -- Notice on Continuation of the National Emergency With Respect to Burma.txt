    On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208), that the Government of Burma has committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by United States persons contained in that section. The President also declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.
On July 28, 2003, the President issued Executive Order 13310, taking additional steps with respect to that national emergency by putting in place an import ban required by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and prohibiting exports of financial services to Burma and the dealing in property in which certain designated persons have an interest. On October 18, 2007, the President issued Executive Order 13448, expanding the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047 and taking additional steps to prohibit transactions or dealings with certain persons, including the Burmese regime's financial supporters and their companies, as well as individuals determined to be responsible for or to have participated in human rights abuses or to have engaged in activities facilitating public corruption in Burma.
On April 30, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13464, taking additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047, in order to address the Government of Burma's continued repression of the democratic opposition in Burma.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date, July 28, 2003, October 18, 2007, and April 30, 2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burma.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
