    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Kildee (D) MI)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the Head Start program, but strongly opposes H.R. 4421 unless it is amended to eliminate reauthorization of the following programs, each of which the Administration has recommended for termination: Follow Through, Dependent Care, and the Community Services Block Grant (including Community Food and Nutrition). These programs are unnecessary and duplicate several other existing Federal authorities.
The Administration urges enactment of H.R. 4527, its Head Start reauthorization proposal, instead of H.R. 4421.
