    Deputy Communications Director Phil Singer issued the following statement in response to the DNC's meeting with the Florida delegation today on seating its delegation:
"We have long maintained that pretending the voters of Florida and Michigan don't exist is not fair in principle and unwise in practice. This morning's Quinnipiac poll out of Florida reflects the urgent need for Democrats to get behind our effort to count Florida's voters and seat its delegation. Chairman Dean is clearly committed to seating the Florida delegation and we urge Senator Obama to join us in calling on the rules and bylaws committee to make this a reality."
