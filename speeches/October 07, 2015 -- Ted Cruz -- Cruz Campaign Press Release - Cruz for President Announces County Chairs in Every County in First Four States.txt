    HOUSTON, Texas – The Cruz for President campaign today announced that it has named a chairman in all 171 counties that comprise the first four early states – 99 Iowa counties, 10 New Hampshire counties, 46 South Carolina counties, and 16 Nevada counties.
"The only way we will turn our country around is through a grassroots uprising of the American people, and I'm grateful for the many courageous conservatives in the early states who have stepped forward to lead that grassroots movement," Cruz said. "I've always known we would have a great organization, but having a leader the 171 counties that comprise the four early states is an incredible achievement."
The campaign is also well-organized beyond the early states, having named more than 500 state team leaders in 19 states and one territory to date.
