    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault of France at the White House. Ambassador Rice offered condolences for the deaths of three French personnel in Libya and reiterated condolences on behalf of the American people for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Nice on Bastille Day. Ambassador Rice and Foreign Minister Ayrault agreed on the importance of continued close U.S.-French cooperation, including to advance the campaign against ISIL, to facilitate a genuine political transition to end the conflict in Syria, and to support for the Libyan Government of National Accord. In discussing the recent British vote to exit the European Union, Ambassador Rice emphasized that the United States has encouraged both sides to negotiate the UK's exit from the EU in a process that is smooth, orderly, and productive. She stressed that the United States will continue our robust work with Paris and other EU capitals to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity in Europe and beyond.
