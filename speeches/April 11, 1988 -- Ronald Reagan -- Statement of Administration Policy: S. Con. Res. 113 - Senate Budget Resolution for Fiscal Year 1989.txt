    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Chiles, (D) Florida)
The Administration congratulates the Senate Budget Committee for its timely action on the Budget Resolution for FY 1989. While the Administration may disagree with the levels of funding for particular programs assumed in S.Con.Res. 113, the Administration strongly supports meeting the various constraints of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, as the Senate Budget Committee Resolution purports to do.
The Administration is concerned that the scoring rules adopted by the Senate Budget Committee may be in conflict with the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. The Administration would like to emphasize that appropriations measures must be scored consistent with the understanding in effect last November.
The Administration hopes these issues can be resolved quickly, and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the deficit reductions agreed to last November.
