    Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) issued the following statement in response to news that former Governor Rick Perry had suspended his presidential campaign.
Rick Santorum said:
"Rick Perry is a great man and a committed public servant. One of the blessings of the 2012 Republican presidential primary was getting to know Rick and his family. He became a truly wonderful friend and I am grateful for that bond each day. I wish him, his wife Anita, and their children nothing but the best. I am sure this is not the end of Governor Perry's service to our nation."
