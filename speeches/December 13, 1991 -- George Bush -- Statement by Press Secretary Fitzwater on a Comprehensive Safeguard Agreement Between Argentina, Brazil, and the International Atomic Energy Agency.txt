    The President has congratulated Presidents Menem and Collor for their statesmanship in signing a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Presidents Collor and Menem have shown great energy and leadership in fulfilling the commitments they undertook in the November 1990 declaration in Foz do Iguacu to devote their nuclear programs exclusively to peaceful purposes and to submit all their nuclear activities to IAEA safeguards.
This action will contribute greatly to peace and stability in the Western Hemisphere and throughout the world. We wish Presidents Menem and Collor continued success as they work toward the final objective of the Iguacu declaration: The full entry into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco in their national territories. We call on all nations that need to take steps for the Treaty to enter into force throughout Latin America to do so at an early date, freeing the continent from the dangers of a nuclear arms race.
