Families are working harder than ever, but living paycheck to paycheck. Students are doing exactly what we told them to do and getting a college education. Yet they are graduating with mountains of debt and a degree that has no career path.
The news says evil is winning and we are less capable than ever to stop it.
Is it decline? Is it the normal course of history?
No.
It's a direct result of our leaders who have trapped us in the past.
Leaders from yesterday still believe in outdated economic policies. They have forgotten one of the timeless truths of our world: Jobs and prosperity are tied to our ability to compete internationally.
Today we face a fundamental economic transformation that leaves us with a choice.
We can embrace the future or be left behind by history.
In the New American Century we will reform our tax code and update our economic policies to make America the best place in the world to work, start a business and cultivate innovation.
It's time to leave yesterday behind.
