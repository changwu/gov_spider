    As a United States Senator, Joseph Montoya dedicated himself to legislation that would promote progress and benefit the people of his State and Nation. From the time he was first elected to the State house of representatives at the age of 21, he devoted his life to public serviceâ€”a total of 38 years in office.
He attained justified, national recognition for his performance in the Senate at a time of national crisis.
Senator Montoya was part of the ancient and proud Hispanic tradition of New Mexico. My deepest sympathy goes out to his family at his death.
