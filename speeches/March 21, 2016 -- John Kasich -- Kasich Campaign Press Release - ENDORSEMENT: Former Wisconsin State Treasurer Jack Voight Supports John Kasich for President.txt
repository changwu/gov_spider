    Today, former Wisconsin State Treasurer Jack Voight announced his support for Ohio Governor John Kasich and joined the Kasich for America leadership team.
"John Kasich has a proven record of balancing budgets, cutting taxes and fostering an environment for job creation. It is a recipe of success to shrink government, stop out-of-control spending and put power back in the hands of taxpayers around the country. That is the kind of leadership we need in the White House and exactly why I am supporting Kasich for president," said Voight.

Jack Voight served as the state treasurer in Wisconsin from 1995-2007.
"I appreciate Jack Voight's endorsement," said Kasich. "As Treasurer of Wisconsin, he successfully brought a higher level of accountability and fiscal sense to his state. He is a reformer and a remarkably dedicated public servant."
