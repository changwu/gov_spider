    I've got a brief statement I'm going to make if I can. I think the voters sent a clear message last night: Both parties have to step up and do something about crime, as well as gun violence.
And I sent, as you recall—with the first major bill we passed, we gave the States and localities billions of dollars—billions of dollars they have—and I encouraged them to use it to hire police officers and reform their police departments. Very few have done it.
In addition to that, I sent the Congress a request for $300 million in this year's budget to deal with hiring cops, to retrain cops, as well as to make sure they are adequately dispersed around the communities.
It's time they move. It's time to States and the localities spend the money they have to deal with crime, as well as retrain police officers, as well as provide for more community policing. It's time to get on with doing that. And that's what I think the message last night from the American public was in all the primaries.
Thank you.
