    Today, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder made the following statement on Mitt Romney's proposals for reforming education:
"Too many students are being forced to move back home with their parents after graduating because they can't find a job. Mitt Romney has a long track record as a job creator; he understands what it will take to get the economy running again. Mitt Romney's plan to align higher education with the needs of the job market is on the right track. Simplifying the student loan process and giving students the tools they need to make informed decisions will help ensure they are able to start their careers without being saddled with massive debt. Here in Michigan, we approved tenure reform legislation that makes it easier to reward great teachers and remove ineffective ones from the classroom. We also recently approved changes that will give parents and students more choices about where to attend school, including expanding options for online classes. Mitt Romney will bring ideas like these to the national stage. As a proud nerd, I'm encouraged by Mitt Romney's education reform plan."
