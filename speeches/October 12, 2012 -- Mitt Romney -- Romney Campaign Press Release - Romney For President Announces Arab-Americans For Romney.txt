    Romney for President today announced its Arab-Americans for Romney coalition. 
"I am very proud to have so many distinguished Arab-Americans on my team," said Mitt Romney. "This country has been a beacon to people around the globe. The American Dream belongs to the world, but lately, it has been harder to pursue that dream. I am committed to bringing prosperity to the United States and creating the good jobs that foster opportunity and will inspire another generation of dreamers. Together, we will restore America to the land of possibility it has always been."
"Over the decades, people have come to our country from around the world to pursue their dreams," said former Senator John E. Sununu. "But lately, it's been harder and harder to do just that. President Obama never hesitates to tell us that he inherited a tough economy. But he's less verbose in explaining why his policies have been so disappointing and what he would do differently these next four years if he is reelected. What we need is leadership, and that is precisely what Mitt Romney is offering. He has the experience and the plan to do what President Obama has failed to do—get Americans working again. And when he does, the dream that drove so many Arab-Americans and their forefathers to come to our shores will be alive again."
