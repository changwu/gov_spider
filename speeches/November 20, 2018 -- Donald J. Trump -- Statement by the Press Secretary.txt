    At this very moment, massive numbers of aliens are arriving at our southern border, threatening to incapacitate our already overwhelmed immigration system. Yet now, a single district judge has issued a nationwide temporary restraining order preventing the executive branch from performing its Constitutional duty to enforce our borders and control entry into the United States. This decision will open the floodgates, inviting countless illegal aliens to pour into our country on the American taxpayer's dime. The court's ruling is contrary to well-established Federal law, the Attorney General's and Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the President's own Constitutional and statutory authority. This temporary injunction is yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences, which are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American people, and interfering with the executive branch's authority to administer the immigration system in a manner that ensures the Nation's safety, security, and the rule of law. We will take all necessary action to defend the executive branch's lawful response to the crisis at our southern border.
