MITT ROMNEY: "I don't think you can afford another doubling of gasoline prices under Barack Obama. I mean, since he's been president, the price of gasoline has doubled, and that's happened in part because the President has not taken advantage of our energy. When I become president, we're going to double the number of permits on federal lands and federal waters for drilling, make sure that we can get more oil and gas and use our coal and our nuclear, renewables. We're going to have an energy abundance in America and keep our prices more moderate."
