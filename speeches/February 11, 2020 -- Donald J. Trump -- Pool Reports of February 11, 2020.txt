Pool Report # 4 - News from the Oval
After the veterans' bill signing, POTUS spent about 13 minutes taking questions. Here are the headlines:
- He hasn't gotten involved in the Roger Stone sentencing matter even though he could have, but "I thought it was ridiculous...I thought the (original) recommendation was ridiculous, I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous."
- He demurred when asked if he might consider commuting Stone's sentence.
- Blamed the severity of the original Stone sentencing proposal on some of the same prosecutors who worked for Robert Mueller; "They ought to be ashamed of themselves...I think it's been disgraceful."
- On two separate occasions he launched on Michael Bloomberg for going to a church and apologizing for his stop-and-frisk policies as NYC mayor. "He was practically crying...pathetic...he's a lightweight and and you're gonna find out. he's also one of the worst debaters I've ever seen."
"Our country doesn't need that kind of leadership."
"Romney is a disgrace."
More hard shots against Lt. Col. Vindman. More TK
Biden may be able to come back but it will be hard. "Obama took him off the garbage heap."
"I don't see how we lose but you never know."
Urge all to check the transcript carefully.

Pool Report #5 - Addendum and Lid
A travel/photo lid was called at 4:52.
Again, please check the transcript and cable news video.
Trump on Stone matter: "I have not been involved."
Asked if he knew the whistleblower's identity, he smiled and replied: "I don't want to say, but you'd be surprised."
He didn't break much new ground on Lt. Col. Vindman, but clearly he's still not happy with the ex-NSC officer. He went on at length about the transcript: "we had a totally accurate transcript." As for Vindman, "we sent him on his way" and the military can do whatever it wants.
As he has before, he described Adam Schiff as a sick person."

Pool Report # 6 Veterans 
The news uttered by the President overshadowed the stated purpose of the event - the signing of a bill opening more opportunities to "our amazing vets" and their families. The bill he signed is focused on expanding vet jobs in the fields of science, technology , engineering and mathematics (STEM). "It's a big deal," he said of the legislation.
The President couldn't resist an acronym of his own: the stock market is doing so well that there are four one trillion dollar U.S. companies: Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apple. Which spells - MAGA. POTUS held up a sheet of paper making that very connection.
POTUS talked again about well the economy is doing and noted that the stock market has reached a new high 144 times on his watch.
