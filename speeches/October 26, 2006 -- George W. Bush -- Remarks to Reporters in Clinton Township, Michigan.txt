The President. They asked me why I came here, and I said, one, I like small businesses, and two, I like sweets. [Laughter]
The entrepreneurial spirit is strong in this store. And the job of those of us in Washington who are lucky enough to serve the American people is to keep the taxes low on the small-business people, as well as the people who work for the small-business people.
And so we want to wish you all the best. Thanks for thinking the big dream.
Ronald W. Rapson. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for coming. Enjoy Sanders hot fudge, one of the best products in the State of Michigan.
The President. Looking forward to it. [Laughter]
Mr. Rapson. A couple of Michigan State and Michigan candy bars for you there.
The President. There you go. Now, the other thing is, is that the big money here is, of course, with the press corps. And I would fully suspect you all to shop. [Laughter] Fletcher [Michael Fletcher, Washington Post], how about it?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. All right. Thank you. Good to be with you.
