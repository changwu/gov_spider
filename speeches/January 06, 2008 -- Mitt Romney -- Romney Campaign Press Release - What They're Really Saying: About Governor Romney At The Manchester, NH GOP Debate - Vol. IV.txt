Fox News' Chris Wallace: "As far as Mitt Romney, I thought it was the best he has done in any of the debates I have seen. Not only the performance and the demeanor which was quite commanding." (Fox News' "Live," 1/6/08)
ABC News' Rick Klein: "I do think, for late-breaking voters, Romney comes across well because he's in command of his facts and looks very, very presidential." (Rick Klein, "Live Blogging During GOP Forum," ABC News' Political Radar Blog, http://blogs.abcnews.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
Power Line's Paul Mirengoff: "Mitt Romney, in my view, was the winner. His answers were crisp, knowledgeable, and poised. He was solid on each substantive issue and effective in defending his so-called attack ads. My guess is that he's cemented himself as the choice of Republicans in New Hampshire...." (Paul Mirengoff, "My Impressions Of Tonight's Debate," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
Time Magazine's Joe Klein: "Mitt Romney – even though under assault constantly in Saturday night's debate – has had two of his best debate performances yet." (Joe Klein, " McCain's Lost Weekend," Time's The Swampland Blog, http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/, Posted 1/6/08)
RedState's Erick Erickson: "As for the actual candidates. I think Fred Thompson and Mitt Romney did the best tonight. Mitt seemed even paced all night." (Erick Erickson, "Winners And Losers Tonight," RedState Blog, http://www.redstate.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
National Review's Rich Lowry: "[Romney] spoke forcefully and put the case for himself as the reformist businessman in the best possible light. I think he basically dominated the first hour, and fell off a tab after that, but otherwise was truly excellent. His best performance yet, in very high pressure circumstances. His answers on taxes, job creation, and immigration were top notch." (Rich Lowry, "Romney & McCain In Fine Form," National Review's The Corner Blog, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
The American Spectator's Quin Hillyer: "Romney does a great job explaining the characteristics needed in a president (and why executive leadership trumps Senate leadership and why executive leadership is more important than specific foreign policy expertise)." (Quin Hillyer, "After Commercial," The American Spectator's Blog, http://www.spectator.org/, Posted 1/6/08)
National Review's Kathryn Jean Lopez: "Romney was gracious on-point tonight. Good for him. This nomination fight isn't close to over. Thankfully." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "A Good Night," National Review's The Corner Blog, corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 1/6/08)
Townhall's Mary Katharine Ham: "1. Mitt: He was a stronger, more real version of Mitt tonight. I truly enjoyed it, and I haven't thought he's won a debate since the very first Republican debate." (Mary Katharine Ham, "Winners And Losers: Rank 'Em Up," Townhall Blog, http://www.townhall.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Ham: "I think he probably did himself a lot of good in New Hampshire tonight, and the Luntz focus group shows it." (Mary Katharine Ham, "Winners And Losers: Rank 'Em Up," Townhall Blog, http://www.townhall.com/, Posted 1/6/08)

Race 4 2008's Tommy Oliver: "Mitt Romney was very good." (Tommy Oliver, "Debate Wrapup," Race 4 2008 Blog, http://race42008.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Oliver: "Romney did what he had to do tonight." (Tommy Oliver, "Debate Wrapup," Race 4 2008 Blog, http://race42008.com/, Posted 1/6/08)

MSNBC'S Chuck Todd: "Given the circumstance, I actually think Romney had a better night than yesterday. He looked more in command than he did last night; this isn't a guy who's going to be giving up easily." (Chuck Todd, "Initial Take: Change Vs. Experience; Did Change Win?" MSNBC's First Reads, http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
Conservative Blogger's William Smith: "Mitt Romney had the performance of the night. He was prepared. He was solid. He defended his record and drew specific contrast between himself and his opponents. Romney pulled off the kind of performance that should only add to his lead." (William Smith, "Thoughts On Tonight's FOX News Republican Forum..." Conservative Blogger, http://www.conservativeblogger.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
