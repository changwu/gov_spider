    Dole for President Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"It's no surprise that Bill Clinton, the, man who levied the largest tax increase in history, would find fault with a plan that puts more money into the hands of Americans. In reality, the Dole tax cut plan is economist-approved, deficit-reducing, and family friendly. Bill Clinton may think tax cuts are irresponsible.. but Bob Dole knows tax cuts are key to giving American families control of their money, their lives, and their dream."
