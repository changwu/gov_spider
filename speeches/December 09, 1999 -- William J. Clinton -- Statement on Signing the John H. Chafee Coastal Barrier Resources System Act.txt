    I am pleased to sign into law S. 1866, the "John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System Act." Renaming the Coastal Barrier Resources System in Senator Chafee's honor is an appropriate tribute to a man who worked so hard—and so successfully—to find common ground in the struggle to protect and preserve the environment for future generations.
Senator Chafee authored the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, a law which protects pristine and fragile coastal barriers from development by restricting Federal expenditures that would otherwise encourage such development. This Act has successfully minimized the loss of human life by discouraging development in high-risk areas. It also has reduced the wasteful expenditures of Federal resources and protected the natural resources associated with coastal barriers. Today, approximately 3 million acres of fragile coastal barrier lands are part of the Coastal Barrier Resources System created by the Act.
Senator Chafee's legacy of achievements in environmental protection is extraordinary and far ranging. He worked tirelessly to ensure the protection of our land, air, and water and he took special pride in the success of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. For this reason, it is especially fitting that we honor Senator Chafee by renaming the Coastal Barrier Resources System as the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System.
