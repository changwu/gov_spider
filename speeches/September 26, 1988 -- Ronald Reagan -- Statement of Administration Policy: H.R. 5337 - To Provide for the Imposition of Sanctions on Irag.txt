    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 31 others)
The Administration supports the objective of H.R. 5337, and is determined to prevent Iraq from using chemical weapons again against the Kurds or anyone else. Prevention of chemical weapons use by anyone, anywhere, is of transcendant importance. Our relationship with Iraq is important, but the issue of chemical weapons use overrides other bilateral considerations. If the new and extensive controls on exports to Iraq contained in H.R. 5337 would bring us closer to achieving the objective of ending chemical weapons use by Iraq, the Administration would not hesitate to support imposition of such controls. The Administration does not support the legislation because it would not bring us closer to that objective.
