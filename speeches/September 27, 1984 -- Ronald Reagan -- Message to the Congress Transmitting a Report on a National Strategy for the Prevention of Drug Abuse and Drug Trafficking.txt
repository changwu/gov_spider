    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Title III, Section 305 of the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1972, as amended, I hereby transmit the 1984 National Strategy for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking. The Strategy establishes a comprehensive national plan of action which includes prevention of drug abuse through awareness and action, drug law enforcement, international cooperation to eliminate the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, and health-related treatment and research activities.
I am pleased with the progress in raising public awareness of drug abuse problems and in strengthening our efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, both domestic and international. Most important is the widespread recognition that the situation is not hopeless; that drug abuse can be conquered. Our citizens have begun numerous grassroots efforts which are likely to accomplish far more in preventing drug abuse than the Federal government, working alone, could hope to achieve.
I thank the Congress for its dedication and continuing support in the fight against drug abuse.
