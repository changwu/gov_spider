    Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). The request is needed to liquidate legitimate prior-year obligations for eligible participants in the AmeriCorps program, to complete the implementation of a comprehensive corrective action plan developed by CNCS to strengthen financial management, and to provide flexibility to support more than 50,000 AmeriCorps members in FY 2003. This request will not increase my FY 2004 request.
The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
