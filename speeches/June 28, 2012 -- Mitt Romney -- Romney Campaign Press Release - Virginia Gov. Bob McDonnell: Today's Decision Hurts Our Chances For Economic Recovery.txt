    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama's disastrous healthcare law is detrimental to the Virginia economy, our nation's prospects for economic recovery and the free-market system. Governor Romney has committed to repeal and replace Obamacare on day one of his administration, and that is why this election is so critical. It's going to be a clear choice between President Obama's big government takeover, accompanied by skyrocketing costs and tax increases, and Governor Romney's faith in free markets and consumer choice. With Governor Romney's leadership, we can replace Obamacare with healthcare solutions that put patients and doctors, not bureaucrats, in charge of healthcare in America and without sacrificing American jobs in the process."
