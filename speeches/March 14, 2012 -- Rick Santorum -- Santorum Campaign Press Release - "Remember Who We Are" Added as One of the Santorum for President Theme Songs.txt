    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce that it has chosen "Remember Who We Are" by Nashville artist Krista Branch as one of its theme songs.
Rick Santorum said: "Our campaign has focused on returning to a government that believes in the American people again, and few songs express the beauty and strength of who we are as free Americans better than Krista's. 'It's our time,' as the song says - our time to take a firm, unwavering stand against big government; and it is our time to take our country back.
Our campaign is a grassroots bottom-up movement - not a top-down, Washington insider campaign. We are supported by men and women across this country who understand what it means to be free. We must remember who we are, and that we are blessed to be a nation of free people. We have a responsibility to reclaim the foundation of freedom in its fullest sense - and to do everything we can to restore and preserve it for our children and grandchildren."
"Remember Who We Are" is available to download on ITunes and can be heard on YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHtVxDz43KY&sns=em
