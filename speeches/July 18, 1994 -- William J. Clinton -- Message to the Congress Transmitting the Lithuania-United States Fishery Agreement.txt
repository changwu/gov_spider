    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania Extending the Agreement of November 12, 1992, Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, with annex. The agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Vilnius, Lithuania on February 22, 1994, and May 11, 1994, extends the 1992 agreement to December 31, 1996. The exchange of notes, together with the 1992 agreement, constitutes a governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of section 201(c) of the Act.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the Republic of Lithuania, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
