    Montana House Member Franke Wilmer today announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President. Wilmer represents Montana House District 64, and is professor of political science and international relations at Montana State University. In 2005 she was appointed by Gov. Schweitzer to serve as chair of the Human Rights Commission.
"I'm proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. She not only has vision, she has substance. Hillary is the candidate with a plan and the know-how to make real change," Wilmer said.
"I am thrilled to have the support of Franke Wilmer. For years Franke has been committed to promoting social justice and human rights in Montana, through both public service and academics," Clinton said.
Wilmer cited Clinton's understanding of issues facing Montana and rural America as a deciding factor in her endorsement.
"Children, the elderly and the neediest Montanans should all have health care, not just some of us. Hillary's healthcare plan is the only one that will take care of all Montanans," Wilmer said. "Also, Hillary understands the need for alternative energy, knows how to get there, and knows Montana can be a leader in the effort."
In the Montana Legislature where she has served since 2007, Wilmer currently chairs the Committee of State Administration and Veterans Affairs (interim) and serves on the governor's Capital Financial Advisory Council. As an academic, Wilmer's expertise is in political science and international affairs. In past years she has served as Montana State University's Political Science department head.
