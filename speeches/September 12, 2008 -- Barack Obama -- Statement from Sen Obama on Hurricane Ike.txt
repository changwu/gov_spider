    Chicago, IL - Below is a Statement from Senator Barack Obama on Hurricane Ike:
"As another storm threatens the Gulf Coast, I'm praying for the safety of all those in Hurricane Ike's path, and urge everyone to heed the warnings of local authorities and seek safer ground immediately. Those who choose to stay are putting not only themselves at risk, but the emergency personnel working to ensure their safety. Now is the time to help those who want to leave but aren't able to - and once the storm passes, we must work to provide swift relief wherever it is needed," said Senator Barack Obama.
