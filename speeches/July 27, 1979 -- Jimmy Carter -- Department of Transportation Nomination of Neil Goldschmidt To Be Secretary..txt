    The President will nominate Neil Goldschmidt of Portland, Oregon, as Secretary of Transportation.
The President said, "Mayor Goldschmidt is known as an aggressive and innovative mayor with outstanding administrative abilities. He understands from personal experience the transportation needs of local governments. He will have my full support and confidence, and I have no doubt that he will be an outstanding Secretary of Transportation."
Mayor Goldschmidt and Acting Secretary of Transportation Graham Claytor have already discussed plans for a smooth transition.
Mayor Goldschmidt served as chairman of the transportation committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and has established a transportation system in Portland that is nationally recognized.
