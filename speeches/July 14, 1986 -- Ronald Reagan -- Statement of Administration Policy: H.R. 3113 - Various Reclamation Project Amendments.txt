    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Rep. Miller (D) California)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 3113, but only if the bill is amended to:
— eliminate the interest-free feature of Federal loans for irrigation and require that the bill's interest rate (Treasury borrowing costs plus one-eighth percent) apply to all new loans, including irrigation loans, made under the Small Reclamation Project Act. In a time of extreme budget restraint, it is fully appropriate and equitable to require that all beneficiaries of such reclamation projects pay interest at market rates on their loans; and
— delete title IV because it would provide an unjustified exemption to four water irrigation districts by voiding a requirement in current law under which user charges are imposed on non-Federal powerplants for the use of Federal dams and facilities related to hydropower production. Such exemptions are unfair and out of step with the general trend to compensate the Government when its property is used for private purposes.
