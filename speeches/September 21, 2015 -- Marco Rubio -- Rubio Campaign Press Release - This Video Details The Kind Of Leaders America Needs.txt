    

Our people and our economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st Century, but too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th Century.
If I'm our nominee, our party will be the party of the future. We'll be the party of the 21st century. We'll be the party of the bartenders and maids.
Together we can speak to the hearts and minds of millions of Americans who still believe that America can be greater.
We just need our leaders to show us the way.
