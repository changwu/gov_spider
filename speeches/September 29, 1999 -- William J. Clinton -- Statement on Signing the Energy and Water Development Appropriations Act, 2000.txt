    I have signed into law H.R. 2605, the "Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2000," which provides $21.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for the programs of the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, the Army Corps of Engineers, and several smaller agencies.
The Act provides necessary funding to maintain my Administration's commitment to ensuring the safety and reliability of our Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. The Act also provides funding to develop and protect the Nation's water resources.
I am disappointed that the Congress has not included full funding for my request for the Spallation Neutron Source, for additional safeguards and security reforms at the Department of Energy laboratories, or for research and development of renewable energy sources. I am also disappointed that the Congress has provided no funding for the Next Generation Internet and Information Technology Initiatives. Also, I note that the bill contains language that prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers from studying the full range of options for salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest. I will continue to work with the Congress on this important national priority. Finally, I am disappointed that the Congress has not enacted my Harbor Services Fund proposal, which would provide a stable source of funding for port and harbor activities and free up funds for other priority projects and programs. My Administration will work with the Congress on options for financing and increasing support for these initiatives in the future.
