    By registering their biggest monthly surge in nearly 33 years, the leading economic indicators in January flashed a bright green light for recovery. They provide compelling new evidence that the United States economy is rapidly gaining strength. Nine of the ten indicators rose, with solid gains in the average work week, new orders, and building permits. Our great national struggle to make this economy well again is beginning to pay off. For the sake of every American, it is imperative that the Congress work with our administration in a bipartisan spirit to build a lasting recovery that will create more jobs. If we do, and we resist going back to the inflationary policies of the past, we can create an era of prosperity filled with new opportunities for the American people.
