Phil Handy said, "President Obama and his policies have failed to deliver promised results to the American people. Mitt Romney's leadership is needed today more than ever. His record as Governor of Massachusetts and experience in the private sector gives me great confidence that he can put our country back on the path to prosperity. He understands the important connection between America's global economic competitiveness and world-class schools. As governor, he emphasized innovation and results at the state level and guided Massachusetts to distinction as a national leader in education."
