    As Governor Bush laid out in his announcement speech, we need an American president who will work in solidarity with a free Cuban people, not one that capitulates to an oppressive Castro regime.

President Obama's concessions to Castro have not resulted in more democracy or freedom for the Cuban people. In fact, Havana's repression of its citizens has continued despite the Obama administration's unilateral concessions, and in fact 75 democracy activists were arrested just last weekend. On Friday, Hillary Clinton will announce her support of President Obama's call to lift the Cuban embargo.
Hillary Clinton was adamantly against easing restrictions with Cuba in 2000 and 2008, going so far as to confirm she would not meet with Raul Castro until there was evidence of political change. There has been no change â€” and this is just another example of Hillary Clinton putting political expediency ahead of doing what's right.
Hillary Clinton and President Obama claim that our Cuba policy is a relic of history, but it's the Castro regime that is stuck in the cold war. As Governor Bush said last week, "The Cuban people are not imprisoned by the past, they are imprisoned by the Castro regime."
