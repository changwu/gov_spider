    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of the Sangamon County Republican Party. The County Party endorsed Mayor Giuliani last night at a meeting led by the county's Party Chairman Tony Libri.
"Mayor Giuliani is the Republican Party's best chance at victory in the general election," said Libri. "As Mayor of New York City, Rudy proved his ability to lead in times of crisis and that he has the executive experience needed to stop Washington's out of control spending."
"Rudy's campaign continues to gain momentum across Illinois. Securing the Sangamon County GOP's endorsement is further testament to the energy and excitement Rudy's campaign has in Illinois," said Dave White, Giuliani's Sangamon County Chair.
"As the campaign rolls on toward the February 5th primary, Mayor Giuliani continues to display his commitment to winning Illinois," said Rep. Tom Cross, Giuliani's State Chairman. "Rudy's message of cutting taxes and fiscal discipline is resonating with voters and increasing his grassroots support across the state."
The Sangamon County Republican Party joins a strong and growing Illinois team that includes Congresswoman Judy Biggert, former Governors Jim Edgar and Jim Thompson, former Lt. Governor Corinne Wood, former Attorney General Jim Ryan, and former Congressman Tom Ewing.
