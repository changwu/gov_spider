    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday in separate calls with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. Both Chancellor Merkel and President Macron agreed with President Trump that the Syrian regime, and its Russian and Iranian supporters, should immediately and fully implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401, which calls for an immediate ceasefire across Syria. The leaders called on Russia to stop bombing East Ghouta, to compel the Assad regime to halt offensive operations against civilian areas, and to hold Syria accountable for the deteriorating human rights conditions in East Ghouta, caused in part by the Assad regime's continued use of chemical weapons, attacks on civilians, and blocking of humanitarian aid. The President underscored that the United States will not tolerate the atrocities of the Assad regime. The leaders also shared their serious concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent statements on nuclear weapons development, which they agreed detract from productive discussion of a range of issues between Russia and the West.
