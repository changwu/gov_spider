    Chicago, IL - "I spent much of my childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, and for most of my adult life, I've lived in Chicago, a city with its own vibrant Asian American and Pacific Islander community. So I join millions of Americans in celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month by honoring the many contributions this community has made to our country."
"Let's honor them by rededicating ourselves to the challenges we all have in common - whether it's protecting our civil rights, making college more affordable, or passing comprehensive immigration reform. And let's fight for affordable, high-quality health care, so we can cover the 2.4 million Asian American and Pacific Islanders who are currently uninsured. Finally, let's make sure that Asian American and Pacific Islanders are getting the pay and jobs they deserve by raising the minimum wage and investing in small businesses."
"This month, let's honor Asian American and Pacific Islanders by coming together to build a better future for all Americans."
