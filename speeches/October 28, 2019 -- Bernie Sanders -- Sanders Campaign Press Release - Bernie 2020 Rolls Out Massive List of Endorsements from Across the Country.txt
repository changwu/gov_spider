    WASHINGTON - In just the last week, Bernie 2020 announced endorsements from one hundred elected officials, activists, and community leaders from across the country, including in California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, among others.
The endorsements follow a rally and endorsement from Rep. Rashida Tlaib yesterday in Detroit, as well as endorsements from Reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. The endorsements represent a diverse slate local leaders and progressive elected officials and show the strength of Sanders movement in communities across the country.
"From Rhode Island to California progressive leaders are getting behind Bernie Sanders' campaign for president, because they know he is the only candidate running who has the guts to take on the corporate elites and the billionaire class," said Faiz Shakir, Bernie 2020 Campaign Manager. "We are proud to have the support of so many progressive leaders. This is a growing movement, driven by both justice and compassion, that will defeat Trump and transform America."
Endorsements include Iowa's Linn County Supervisor Stacey Walker and New Hampshire's Nashua Alderwoman-at-Large Shoshanna Kelly, a rising star in New Hampshire Democratic Party, and first person of color elected to her office in Nashua, as well as multiple mayors in California including Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin and San Luis Obispo Mayor Bruce Delgado.
