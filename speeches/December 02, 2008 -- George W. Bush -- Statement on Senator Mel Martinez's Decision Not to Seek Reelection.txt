    Throughout his distinguished career, Senator Mel Martinez has been a wonderful public servant. Mel's life story is a testament to the power of the American Dream. Since immigrating to the United States from Cuba at the age of 15 as a part of Operation Pedro Pan, he has taken on big challenges and built a record of achievement.
By becoming our country's first Cuban American Cabinet member as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the first Cuban American United States Senator, he has been a source of inspiration to people all across our country. As general chairman of the Republican National Committee, he worked to strengthen our party and expand outreach to new audiences. In addition, he has been a passionate voice for freedom in his native country.
Laura and I thank Mel for his leadership and friendship over the past 8 years, and we wish him and Kitty the best as he finishes his career in the Senate and afterward.
