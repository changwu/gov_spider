A new poll released Thursday evening finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only Republican presidential candidate with enough potential support to defeat Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the November general election in New Hampshire.
Poll Results:
Kasich 50, Clinton 36 (Kasich +14)
Trump 31, Clinton 50 (Trump -19)
Cruz 34, Clinton 48 (Cruz -14) 
Defeating the notion that Kasich is only winning because of lower name ID, Kasich is unknown to just 6 percent of New Hampshire voters. Despite the high name ID, Kasich's favorability numbers are significantly stronger than Cruz and Trump.
Favorable/Unfavorable:
Kasich — 53/31 (+22)
Cruz — 21/72 (-51)
Trump — 21/75 (-54)
From WMUR:
With the possibility of a contested convention for one or both parties, New Hampshire residents who voted in the Primary were asked who they would like to win their party's nomination, regardless of whether that person was currently running for president. There is a degree of "buyer's remorse" among Republican Primary voters as 26% want Kasich to be the nominee, 22% want Trump, 9% want Cruz, 9% want Marco Rubio, 4% want Paul Ryan, 4% want Mitt Romney, 3% want Rand Paul, 2% want Carly Fiorina, and 2% want Jeb Bush.
