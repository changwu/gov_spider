    Thank you all for coming out to say hello. Thank you for making this a really comfortable airplane. [Laughter] I can't tell you what an honor it is to fly overseas in Air Force One and have that big bird park, have people around the world see the great majesty of our country reflected in this airplane.
And I know many of you are working hard to outfit theâ€”its companion. I appreciate your hard work. I will assure you one thing: I will ride that airplane with great pride. I mean, there's nothing better than representing the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.
I appreciate your hard work. Thanks for coming out to say hello. I'd like to kind of work along here and make sure I don't lose my touch and shake a few hands. I'm honored to be here with Senator Pat Roberts and Vicki Tiahrt. They're strong supporters of the programs here, strong supporters of Boeing.
I appreciate you coming out to say hello.
And I ask for God's blessings on your families and on our country. Thank you very much.
