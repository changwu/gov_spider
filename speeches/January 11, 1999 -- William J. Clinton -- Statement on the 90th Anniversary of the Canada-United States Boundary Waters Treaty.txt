    Today the United States and Canada mark the 90th anniversary of our Boundary Waters Treaty, signed on January 11, 1909. I salute the U.S.-Canada International Joint Commission (IJC), established to implement the treaty's terms, meeting today in Ottawa. For most of the 20th century, the IJC has served to prevent and resolve disputes over the use of shared waters and to provide independent advice on other transboundary environmental issues. The excellent relationships we have developed in dealing with the precious air and water resources we hold in trust together reflect the success of the Commission's efforts. From cleaning up the Great Lakes to managing water levels and flows in transboundary lakes and rivers, the Commission has come to serve as a global model for international cooperation in the realm of shared resources. More importantly, the IJC has improved the quality of life for Americans and Canadians while preserving for future generations the beauty and vitality of our lakes and rivers.
Through its air quality monitoring and international watershed initiatives, the Commission is already confronting future environmental challenges along our border. I look forward to its continued success as the United States and Canada extend their partnership into the 21st century.
