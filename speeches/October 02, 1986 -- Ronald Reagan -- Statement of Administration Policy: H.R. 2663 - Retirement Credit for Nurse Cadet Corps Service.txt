    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Slattery (D) Kansas)
The Administration is opposed to H.R. 2663, which would count time spent in the Nurse Cadet Corps during World War II as creditable for civil service retirement. The student nurses in the Corps participated in a training program and were not Government employees. The General Accounting Office has ruled that this training was not Federal service, and that there is no justification for giving the Corps members retirement service credit as if they.were bona fide Federal employees.
