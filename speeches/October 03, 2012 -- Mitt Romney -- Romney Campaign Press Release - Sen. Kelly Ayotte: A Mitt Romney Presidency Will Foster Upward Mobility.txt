    New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte made the following statement on tonight's presidential debate:  
"Mitt Romney's confident, articulate performance tonight laid out the big choice this November in the clearest terms yet. President Obama has an abysmal record and no second-term agenda — meaning voters can only expect another four years of job-killing policies, budget-busting spending, and government-centered health care funded by our hard-earned tax dollars if he is re-elected. A Mitt Romney presidency, on the other hand, will foster upward mobility and success by championing job creation, implementing market-based health care reforms, reining in federal spending, cutting taxes for middle-class families, and protecting American interests abroad."
