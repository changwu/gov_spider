Rick Santorum said: "This is more great news for our campaign. To receive the endorsement of this esteemed group of Colorado conservative leaders today helps prove that we are the only true conservative in this race. This list is made of people who've been great advocates for traditional America and the values that make us great. Their deep network in Colorado and beyond will be a tremendous asset to our campaign as we continue to build the momentum necessary to notjust win the Republican nomination, but defeat Barack Obama this November.
This election is about offering clear contrasts. We have the only clear conservative record that offers a clear conservative contrast to the liberal policies supported by Gov. Romney and Speaker Gingrich - and Barack Obama."
