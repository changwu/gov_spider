    United States Forces took defensive action in the Persian Gulf Monday evening, when an Iranian landing craft was discovered laying mines in international waters 50 miles northeast of Bahrain. We have previously communicated with the Iranian Government the way in which we would respond to such provocative acts which present an immediate risk to United States ships and to all ships. United States Forces acted in a defensive manner and in accordance with existing roes of engagement.
