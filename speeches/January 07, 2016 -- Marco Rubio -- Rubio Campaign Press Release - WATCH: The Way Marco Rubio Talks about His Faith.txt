Marco has a new ad debuting in Iowa, and in it he talks about how his faith plays a pivotal role in his day-to-day life. Take a look:


Our goal is eternity, the ability to live alongside our Creator for all time. To accept the free gift of salvation offered to us by Jesus Christ.
The struggle on a daily basis as a Christian is to remind ourselves of this. The purpose of our life is to cooperate with God's plan.
To those whom much have been given, much is expected. And we will be asked to account for that. Were your treasures stored up on earth or in heaven? And to me, I try to allow that to influence me in everything that I do.
I am Marco Rubio and I approve of this message.
Marco has often spoken about his faith on the campaign trail, and has spoken about being faithful in all aspects of life â€” public and private.
