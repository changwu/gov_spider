    Vice President Kamala Harris today met with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland. The Vice President reaffirmed our ironclad commitment to NATO's Article 5, welcomed our growing defense cooperation with Poland, and thanked the Prime Minister for Poland's leadership in supporting Ukraine's security and for its significant contributions to the provision of humanitarian assistance. The two leaders condemned Russia's continued brutal aggression against Ukraine and discussed their shared determination to continue imposing costs on Russia for its violation of international rules and norms as well as on the Belarusian regime for its malign activities. The leaders discussed the importance of a shared commitment to democratic values, which underpins our close and growing cooperation in other areas. The Vice President expressed appreciation for Poland's leadership in reducing European dependence on Russian energy and congratulated Poland on its selection of a U.S. technology partner for development of its civil nuclear power program, which will strengthen our bilateral ties and European energy security, help address the climate crisis, and create thousands of jobs in each of our countries. They also discussed the importance of close transatlantic alignment on the challenges posed by China.
