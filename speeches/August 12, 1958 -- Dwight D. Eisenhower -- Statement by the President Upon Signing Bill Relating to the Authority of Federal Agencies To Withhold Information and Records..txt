    I HAVE TODAY signed the bill H. R. 2767, "To amend Section 161 of the Revised Statutes with respect to the authority of federal officers and agencies to withhold information and limit the availability of records." The purpose of this legislation is to make dear the intent of the Congress that Section 161 of the Revised Statutes shall not be cited as a justification for failing to disclose information which should be made public.
In its consideration of this legislation the Congress has recognized that the decision-making and investigative processes must be protected. It is also clear from the legislative history of the bill that it is not intended to, and indeed could not, alter the existing power of the head of an Executive department to keep appropriate information or papers confidential in the public interest. This power in the Executive Branch is inherent under the Constitution.
