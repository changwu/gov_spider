Section 1. Establishment of Board. There is established, effective May 16, 1986, a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days after the date of its creation.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 9A(c) of the Act, from the date of the creation of the board and for 120 days thereafter, no change, except by agreement of the parties, shall be made by the carrier or the employees in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.
Sec. 4. Expiration. The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in Section 2 of this Order.
