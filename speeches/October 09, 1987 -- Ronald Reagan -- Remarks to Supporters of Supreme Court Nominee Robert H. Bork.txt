    Audience. We want Bork! We want Bork!
The President. I just want to thank you all and tell you that Judge Bork, if you don't know already, has made a statement to the effect that he is going to remain as the appointee. So, I'm just going to say to you that we are going to fight on for an independent judiciary and we'll stay in the fight and see that we get our story told. Thank you very much.
Audience. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
