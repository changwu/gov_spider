(Senate)
(Sen. Schumer, D-New York, and 5 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3628. The Administration believes the DISCLOSE Act is a necessary measure so that Americans will know who is trying to influence the Nation's elections. S. 3628 also prevents those who should not interfere in the Nation's elections - such as corporations controlled by foreign interests - from doing so. Unless the strong new disclosure rules in S. 3628 are established, the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case will give corporations undue power to influence elections. This bill is not perfect. For example, the Administration would have preferred no exemptions. But, by providing for unprecedented transparency, S. 3628 takes great strides to hold corporations that participate in the Nation's elections accountable to the American people. As this is a matter of urgent importance, the Administration urges the Senate to approve the DISCLOSE Act and looks forward to working with both Houses of Congress promptly to produce a final bill for the President's signature.
