    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after earning the endorsement of the The Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), AFL-CIO. The OPEIU represents over 110,000 workers from all 50 states. Clinton now has the endorsement of 25 national labor unions or labor alliances representing more than 13 million employees.
"I am honored to have again earned the endorsement of The Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU).
OPEIU and their members make our economy run. American workers built the middle class by fighting for higher wages, retirement security, and the right to collectively bargain. Now, working families are under attack by Republicans who want to strip workers of their hard-won rights and keep stacking the deck for those at the top.
As President, I will stand up for workers and fight attacks on collective bargaining. I will fight to protect retirement security and finally secure equal pay for women and paid family leave for allâ€”because when unions are strong, families are strong, and when families are strong, America is strong."
