    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about the unsuccessful Congressional vote on overriding President Bush's veto of legislation to expand SCHIP, the children's health insurance program:
"Today is another sad example of how broken Washington is. Instead of standing up for children and health care, House Republicans have decided to stand up for special interests and lobbyists. From this day forward, House Republicans are on notice. When I am the Democratic nominee, the days of Republican members who voted against children's health care will be numbered. We are taking names and, together, as one party, we will campaign against them."
"Sadly, there is strong message here for Democrats and Republicans. We should never have to consider selling out to lobbyists when it comes to the health of our kids. If universal health care is ever going to be more than a dream, we need to do more than change the president. We need to elect strong Democratic majorities in the House and Senate with the backbone to stand up to the big insurance and drug companies that are going to do everything they can to block universal health care. We need a strong ticket from top to bottom that will compete and win everywhere in America.
"And, when I am the Democratic nominee, we will not only win the White House, we will make every Republican who stands against children's health care pay the price."
