    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am submitting to you a bimonthly report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question.
During this period U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar continued his mission of good offices to achieve a negotiated Cyprus settlement. U.N. Under Secretary General Goulding visited Cyprus from November 6 to 12 to follow up on the Secretary General's discussions with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in September and to explore with them how best to move forward.
According to the Secretary General's December 2 report to the Security Council on the U.N. operation in Cyprus (enclosed), Mr. Goulding discussed with the two Cypriot sides the Secretary General's approach to his mission of good offices and his effort to help the two parties achieve a negotiated settlement. He told the parties that the Secretary General was determined to pursue his efforts, preserving all that had been achieved so far and building on it for future progress.
The two Cypriot sides reiterated to Mr. Goulding their positions on the draft framework agreement submitted by the Secretary General last March. They also expressed their support for the Secretary General's good offices mission.
Mr. Goulding also visited Ankara and Athens and informed the Turkish and Greek governments of his discussions in Cyprus.
Mr. M. James Wilkinson, the U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator, visited Cyprus January 19 to 22 and met with President Kyprianou and Mr. Denktash. Mr. Wilkinson reiterated during his discussion our sincere interest in progress toward a just and lasting Cyprus settlement and our support for the efforts of the U.N. Secretary General to reach that goal. We are continuing our consultations with the Secretary General and with the parties to help them find ways to move forward.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
