    Today, the White House Office of Trade & Manufacturing Policy (OTMP) released a report outlining how China's policies threaten the economic and national security of the United States. Read the full report here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FINAL-China-Technology-Report-6.18.18-PDF.pdf.
OTMP studied how China seeks to capture, through its Made in China 2025 plan, the emerging high-technology industries that will drive future economic growth. China is targeting industries ranging from artificial intelligence, aerospace, and augmented and virtual reality to high-speed rail and shipping and new energy vehicles. Many of these Made in China 2025 industries have important defense applications.
OTMP outlines how China aggressively seeks to acquire American technology and intellectual property through multiple vectors including: physical and cyber theft, forced technology transfers, evading United States export controls, export restraints on raw materials, and investments in more than 600 high-technology assets in the United States worth close to $20 billion.
