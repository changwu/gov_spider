    Thank you, Governor Mickelson, and what a glorious place to plant a tree today. Thank you, Mayor White, for welcoming us here. And most of all, thank all of you. Any excuse to get out of school -- I know how it works. But here you are, and I couldn't be more pleased. Thank you.
The South Dakota Centennial Commission deserves great recognition here for all the restoration of this park as a centennial project. And I know that many people and organizations were involved in the project, and I'd like to congratulate each and every one of them.
I do love seeing all you kids here today. Let me tell you about this tree that I'm presenting today to commemorate the centennial. It's a Bonfire Silver Maple. It's a hardwood tree which provides a brilliant display of colors every fall. And like the people of South Dakota, this tree is hearty and resilient, and should provide beauty to your children for years to come.
Someone said a tree is a gift of God and a friend of man. Well, I hope this tree will grow and flourish, be a friend of Sioux Falls and to South Dakota. And with this gift I can say, as your centennial bumper stickers so proudly proclaim and as your Governor invited me to, I've got roots in South Dakota. Happy birthday South Dakota! And thank you all very, very much for the welcome.
