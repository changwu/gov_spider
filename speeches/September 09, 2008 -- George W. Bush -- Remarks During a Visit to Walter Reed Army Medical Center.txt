    The President. General, thank you for your hospitality, and thank you for your leadership.
I come to Walter Reed to do a couple of things; First, I pay my respects to those who have been wounded; I've come to pay my respects to the healers and doctors and nurses and thank them for their service. I can truthfully say that the health care our troops receive here is first class.
I've also come to pay my respects to family members that are praying that their loved one can get back on their feet and serve again, or get back on their feet and live a normal life.
It's—this is a interesting experience because, on the one hand, you see the horrors of war; on the other hand, you see the courage of the people that have volunteered to serve. I marvel when I come to Walter Reed, I marvel at the fact that people say to me, "Mr. President, I'd do it again." And you see somebody in bed who's been severely wounded, and they look and they say, "I'm honored and proud to have served." They had one kid in there who got hurt pretty bad, and he says, "I'm looking forward to getting back in uniform, getting back on the frontlines."
America is lucky to have men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform and to serve to protect us. And, General, we're lucky—and they're lucky—to have health care that can provide for the wounded and provide comfort to those who need the care. So I'm honored to be with you.
Maj. Gen. Carla G. Hawley-Bowland. Well, thank you. You energize our staff, as well as the patients and their families, to get even better. So thank you very much.
The President. Thank you all. Thank you.
