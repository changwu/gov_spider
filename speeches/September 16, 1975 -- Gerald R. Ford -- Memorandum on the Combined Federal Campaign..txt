Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
I am pleased to announce that the Honorable Frank G. Zarb, Administrator, Federal Energy Administration, will serve as Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area this fall.
This campaign, to begin soon, combines into a single drive the solicitation efforts of the United Way of the National Capital Area, the national health agencies and the international service agencies. In this one drive we will seek to do our share to meet the needs of more than 150 local, national and international health, welfare and social service agencies.
These organizations deserve our wholehearted support. Working together through the Combined Federal Campaign we can provide such support, helping our neighbors and friends with special needs. For those in need, the voluntary agencies are a beacon of hope. Frequently, they are the only source for needed assistance.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign, Federal workers are offered a unique opportunity to help persons in our community, in our Nation and in overseas lands by one gift once a year. Their pledge can be fulfilled through voluntary payroll deductions. I am confident that Frank Zarb will have your wholehearted support in this endeavor. I urge you to commend the campaign with its payroll deduction feature to Federal employees and military personnel in your organization.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the combined campaign in your organization and appoint one of your top assistants as your Vice Chairman. Please tell Frank Zarb if you will serve as Chairman and who you designate as your Vice Chairman.
GERALD R. FORD
