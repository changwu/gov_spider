    I was deeply saddened to hear that Congressman Steve Schiff has died after a courageous year-long battle with cancer. Hillary and I extend our sympathies to his wife, Marcia, and their two children. Steve's constituents in the First Congressional District of New Mexico and people across America have lost an effective legislator and an honorable public servant.
His work on behalf of this Nation will long be remembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
