    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
This letter forwards the Fourth Annual Report of executive branch activities covered by the Privacy Act of 1974. The report reaffirms this Administration's commitment to protecting individual privacy, illustrates steps taken to achieve this goal, and outlines agency activities in administering the Privacy Act during 1978.
I hope you will take this record of our progress into account as you consider the Administration's legislative proposals on individual privacy. This report not only documents how far we have come since the passage of the Privacy Act, but how important personal privacy is to this Administration.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
