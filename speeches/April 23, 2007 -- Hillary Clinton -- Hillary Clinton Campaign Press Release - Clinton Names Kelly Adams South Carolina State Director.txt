    The Hillary Clinton campaign today announced that Democratic operative Kelly Adams will serve as the campaign's South Carolina State Director.
"Kelly is a talented organizer with deep roots in the Palmetto State, and I'm delighted she's going to run our South Carolina campaign," Clinton said.
Adams most recently served as Director of the South Carolina House Democratic Caucus, where she helped craft the caucus' legislative agenda and developed an aggressive fundraising and candidate recruitment program. Prior to that, Adams was a field organizer for the National Association of Social Workers and South Carolina Deputy Director of Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign.
As state director, Adams will oversee the day-to-day operations of Clinton's South Carolina primary campaign.
"At a critical time in our nation's history, Senator Clinton has the experience and vision to get this country back on the right track, and repair America's image in the world," Adams said. "Senator Clinton represents leadership and government we can trust."
