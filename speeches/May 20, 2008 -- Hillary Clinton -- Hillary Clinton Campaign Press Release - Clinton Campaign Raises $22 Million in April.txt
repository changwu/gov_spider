    Fundraising pace represents campaign's 2nd best month of the campaign
The Clinton campaign tonight announced that it raised approximately $22 million in the month of April.
"Senator Clinton's game-changing victories last month turned the tide for this campaign and resulted in an outpouring of grassroots support," said Campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe. "Just like Hillary, our supporters continue to fight. The support for Hillary continues to grow with each month and we are so thankful to the army of supporters who have assured that we'll have the resources needed to win the upcoming contests."
Included in the $22 million total, representing the campaign's second best fundraising month to date, is $10 million raised by the campaign in the 24 hours after Hillary's significant Pennsylvania victory. This total is in addition to a loan to the campaign of $5 million.
Additional details will be available in the campaign's FEC report, to be released later this evening.
