    I am heartened that the House of Representatives rejected the politics of business as usual by passing real, bipartisan campaign finance reform. Passage of the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform legislation is a victory for the American people. Now I urge the Senate Republican leadership to let a majority rule by allowing the Senate to take an up-or-down vote on this historic legislation. The time has come for Congress to redeem the public's faith in the health of our democracy.
