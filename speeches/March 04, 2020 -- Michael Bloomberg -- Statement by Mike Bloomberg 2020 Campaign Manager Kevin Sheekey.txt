    "We launched our campaign exactly 100 days ago. In that incredibly short time, we've built a nationwide coalition focused on building a better future for America, and that starts with defeating Donald Trump in November.
"As Mike has traversed the country, meeting with voters in more than 70 cities across 27 states, he's engaged with voters about his record of taking on tough fights on the issues that matter most to Americans. From his unmatched record on gun safety and climate change, to his plans to lead America through a crisis, Mike Bloomberg has shown voters he knows how to get it done.
"Tonight, only one-third of delegates will be allotted. As Mike said tonight, 'No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible. In just three months, we've gone from just 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination.'
"Our number one priority remains defeating Donald Trump in November."
