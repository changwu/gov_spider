    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related Protocol, signed at New Delhi on September 12, 1989. I also transmit the report of the Department of State on the convention.
The convention would be the first tax treaty between the United States and India. It includes special provisions that take into account India's status as a developing nation and that reflect changes in U.S. tax treaty policy resulting from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Of particular importance are the provisions limiting the withholding tax rates on various categories of investment income, as well as those designed to prevent third-country residents from taking unwarranted advantage of the convention by routing income from one Contracting State through an entity created in the other. The convention also provides for the exchange of information by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.
I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention, together with a related protocol, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
