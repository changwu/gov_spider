    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and five others)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) but opposes provisions of H.R. 3345 that would effectively reduce the regulatory authorities of the agencies primarily responsible for procurement. For example, the Administration opposes assigning the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council authority to issue government-wide procurement regulations, rather than limiting the Council to coordination and monitoring, as provided in S. 2215. The Administration will seek to make this and other appropriate changes as the differences between H.R. 3345 and S. 2215, as passed by the Senate, are reconciled by Congress.
