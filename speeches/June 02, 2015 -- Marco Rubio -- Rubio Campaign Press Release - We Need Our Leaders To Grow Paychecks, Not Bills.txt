In this new century we are facing the most significant period of change since the Industrial Revolution. Instead of benefitting from new opportunities, our people are being held back by challenges. While our economy is transforming, our policies and leaders are not.
The time has come for a new generation of leaders — leaders who will create a growing economy, not a growing government, more paychecks and not more bills.
What we must change now is our leaders. If we can make our time the time of new ideas — we will be well on our way to A New American Century.
