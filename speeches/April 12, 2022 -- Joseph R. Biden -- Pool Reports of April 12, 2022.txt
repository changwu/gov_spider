Travel pool report #10 — POET background
Passing along from the WH:
Background on POET:
POET is the largest producer of first-generation (corn) ethanol in the country. The POET biofuels facility in Menlo, IA was acquired by POET on June 1, 2021. This state-of-the-art bioethanol production facility produces 150 million gallons of bioethanol annually and is one of six facilities recently acquired, bringing POET's annual production capacity to 3 billion gallons of bioethanol (total US annual production is ~15 billion gallons).
POET is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with 33 bioprocessing facilities across eight states and more than 2,200 team members. POET focuses on producing plant-based alternatives to petrochemicals, like Dakota Gold and NexPro distiller grains, Voila corn oil, renewable biofuel, biogenic CO2 and dry ice, purified alcohol, and JIVE asphalt rejuvenator. They have committed to net zero bioprocessing facilities by 2050.
POET has a long history of research and development partnership with DOE and the National Labs, with 5 funded projects from 2003 to present, headlined by a decade-long project for an integrated cellulosic biorefinery (Project LIBERTY in Emmetsburg, Iowa) to produce ethanol from corn stover (the stalks and leaves leftover from harvesting). DOE has invested more than $100 million in the project and, while this project experienced challenges and delays, it represents a major step forward for the cellulosic ethanol industry. The facility began production in 2016 and by 2017 it had reached production efficiency goals.

Travel pool report #12 — arrival, POET
Motorcade arrived at POET at 2:25pm CT
A little color from the ride…
4 onlookers waved to motorcade and filmed as we exited the airport.
At exit 101 on highway 5, a small convoy of Trump supporters greeted the motorcade with the usual signs and flags including "TRUMP 2020/2024" "F*** BIDEN" "LGB" and a thin blue line flag.
Driving through Menlo, pool encountered a few dozen more onlookers. No visible signs to gauge political ideology, but many waved and were filming as pool drove past.
Pool spoke too soon… one pickup truck with a pair of teenagers filmed the motorcade and were flying a giant Trump flag just outside the plant grounds. A second cluster of clearly identifiable Biden supporters was also near the plant entrance. Co-pooler Aurelia End also noticed one older gentleman holding a handmade "CROOKED HILLARY" sign



April 12, 202214:45 CDT

Travel pool report #13 — tour
POTUS had entered the POET facility by the time pool exited the motorcade, but he linked back up with press for the beginning of his walking tour at 2:42pm CT
POTUS was speaking with Congresswoman Axne and Jack Mitchell, Regional Vice President, POET Bioprocessing at the first stop, but pool literally could not hear any words exchanged due to extreme noise at the plant and nearby silos.

POTUS had donned a navy Beau Biden Foundation hat for the outdoor portions of the tour and carried it with him to the additional stop at the Fermentation Chamber indoors.

Travel pool report #23 — boarding, "yes" to genocide
POTUS finished his photo line and headed out onto the tarmac at 5:22pm CT
He stopped to answer questions, confirming "yes" he intentionally used "genocide" during todays remarks. We're wheels up soon but here's audio:
https://otter.ai/u/heTvDnj5Mol1OftA8DfBSX4baRc
Q: have you seen enough evidence to declare genocide?
"It's become clearer and clearer that Putin is trying to wipe out the idea of being Ukrainian.
The evidence is mounting. It looks different than last week. More evidence is coming out literally of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine.
And we're gonna only learn more and more about the devastation and we'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies but it sure seems that way to me"
