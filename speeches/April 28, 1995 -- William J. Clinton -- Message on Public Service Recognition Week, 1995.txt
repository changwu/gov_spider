    Greetings to everyone celebrating Public Service Recognition Week, 1995.
Our nation's government has tremendous potential for good when it works in partnership with citizens to expand opportunity. With the assistance of dedicated public employees, our government has helped to advance civil rights, defend freedom, protect our environment, and uplift the lives of countless Americans. All those who serve the people of the United States can be proud of their contributions to this important legacy.
As our Administration continues its efforts to make government work better and cost less, this week offers Americans a special opportunity to learn more about the importance of public service. Every citizen has a solemn responsibility to understand and become involved in ensuring our country's success. I encourage all of you to discover the many ways in which our government is changing to keep pace with the times. Your participation can help to ensure a brighter future for you and your family and for communities throughout the land.
Best wishes for a most successful week.
BILL CLINTON
