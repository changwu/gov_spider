    The United States strongly condemns the violence initiated by elements of the armed forces of Mali. We call for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule in Mali, including full civilian authority over the armed forces and respect for the country's democratic institutions and traditions. The United States stands by the people of Mali and the legitimately elected government of President Amadou Toumani Toure. We welcome the strong statements by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States condemning this unconstitutional seizure of power.
