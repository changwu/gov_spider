    AUSTIN â€” Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement regarding Donald Trump's comments on Megyn Kelly:
"Donald Trump has proven once again that he doesn't have the temperament to hold our nation's highest office. Attacking veterans, Hispanics and women demonstrates a serious lack of character and basic decency, and his comments distract from the serious issues facing our country."
