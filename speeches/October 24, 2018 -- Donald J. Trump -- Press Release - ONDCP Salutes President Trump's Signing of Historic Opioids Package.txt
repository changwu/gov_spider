    Today, President Trump signed into law historic legislation – the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act – to strengthen our efforts to combat the opioid crisis.
"From day one of this Administration, President Trump has called upon a whole of government approach to combat our addiction crisis," said Deputy Director James Carroll of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). "That call has been manifested into today's bill signing. This historic package makes meaningful reforms to keep illicit drugs out of our communities, better monitor prescribing, prevent addiction and help those suffering with a substance use disorder get the treatment and recovery support they need. It also reauthorizes ONDCP so that we can continue our mission and coordinate across the federal government."
"I want to thank the President and Members of Congress for leading this bipartisan effort to help prevent drug use, treat addiction locally, support Americans in recovery across their lifespan, and stop the flow of illicit drugs into their neighborhoods. By working together, we can save lives, strengthen our communities and safeguard our country."
