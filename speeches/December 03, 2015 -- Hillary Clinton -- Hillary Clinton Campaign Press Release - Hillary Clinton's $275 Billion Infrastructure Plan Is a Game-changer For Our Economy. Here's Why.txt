Hillary just unveiled a $275 billion plan to fix America's infrastructure—or, as she calls it, a "down payment on America's future." It will help repair crumbling bridges and roads. It will also mean world-class airports, a faster rail system, and broadband internet access for every American household.
And Hillary's plan would be a game-changer for creating good-paying, middle class jobs—especially for members of the construction, building, and transportation industries.
Here's how a few of them reacted to the news:

"I think a lot of women don't always have the opportunity to get a good wage but in construction, we do. So building the infrastructure through the United States and having more construction jobs and project labor agreements ... I think is a really great opportunity for women to make better wages, and I think Hillary is the best person for the job."—Deb, painter?


I'm here to support Hillary Rodham Clinton. My personal issue is the middle working class and trying to save for the next generation, for instance, our grandchildren and the future.—Elmer, carpenter


I know that Hillary will support the union as a whole. She can give us more opportunities for work because that's one of the main points that a lot of my brothers and sisters ended up without a job for a long period of time. And they struggle economically. And she's going to look out for our brothers and sisters.—Santos, industrial painter
