    Hillary for America Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds released the following statement after Donald Trump officially announced his running mate:
"We were prepared to respond with the many ways in which Mike Pence is the most extreme pick in a generation—a doubling down of Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies. But after publicly waffling over his own choice, Trump spent more time today making false attacks on Hillary Clinton—several of which could also be leveled against Pence—and talking about his own businesses than his own running mate. It turns out, you can force Trump to make a choice and give him a speech, he's always going to be Trump."
