    One of today's major challenges is the finding of suitable employment for disabled veterans and other handicapped workers. This is a major reason why a proclamation was issued today declaring the week of October 6-12 National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. Although many government and private organizations are participating in this particular week's activities and all of us are concerned, only the employers of the Nation can meet this challenge.
There are now listed with the United States Employment Service approximately 225,000 disabled veterans, in addition to 75,000 other physically handicapped persons who are seeking employment. As long as they are not gainfully employed they represent a substantial loss to the productive capacities of our country.
The United States Employment Service has the facilities to counsel, select, and refer these disabled veterans and other impaired workers to employers. By matching the physical capacities of the applicant with the requirements of the job, USES can refer these useful citizens to jobs in which they can do as good or better work than unimpaired persons. But USES cannot bring jobs and disabled veterans and other handicapped workers together unless employers list their employment needs with USES.
I ask the cooperation of every employer in meeting this challenge. The employment of disabled veterans and other handicapped workers in suitable jobs is not a matter of sentiment or charity. It's good business.
