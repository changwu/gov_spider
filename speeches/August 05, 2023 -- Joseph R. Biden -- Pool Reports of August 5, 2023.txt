Out of town pool report #1 - Church
Hello from Wilmington.
At 5:01 pm the pool bus joined the motorcade near the president's residence and after a very short drive we reached St Joseph on the Brandywine.
At 5:04 pm your pooler spotted POTUS walking towards the entrance of the church.
We are now holding nearby.

Out of town pool report #2 - Back to residence and lid
At 5:51 pm the president came out of the church and spent approximately ten minutes engaging with the people around him.
He chatted with a priest and with parishioners. Your pooler, from a distance, saw him pose for a picture and take selfies.
At 06:03 pm POTUS got back in his car and at 06:09 pm the motorcade dropped him off at his house.
We have a lid for the night, have a nice evening you all.
