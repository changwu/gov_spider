    President's Visit to Wisconsin
Q. Mr. President, your reaction to the crowds and the towns?
The President. Very, very warm and very hospitable reaction. A lot of people coming out, for which I'm grateful.
Q. What did you get?
The President. Vanilla custard. It's highly recommended. I'm recommending vanilla for Hillman [G. Robert Hillman, Dallas Morning News].
Q. You are dripping. You need a napkin.
The President. I'm going to get one in a minute. Would you like some?
Q. No, thanks.
The President. I'm trying to get you a little national publicity.
Q. I think I've got all I need. [Laughter]
The President. I enjoyed talking to you, girls. Enjoyed talking to you. Thank you. All right, let's go back to work.
Q. First a candy store and now ice cream, sir?
The President. I'm loading up, carbo-loading for the weekend. [Laughter]
