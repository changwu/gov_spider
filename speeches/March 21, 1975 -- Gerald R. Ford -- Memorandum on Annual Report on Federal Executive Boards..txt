    Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies
During 1974, the 25 Federal Executive Boards across the nation made significant strides in improving internal Federal management and responding to unique community needs. This Annual Report of the FEBs attests to their collective ability to improve coordination and communication among Federal field offices, at other levels of government, and with the public.
As a result of their demonstrated commitment and enthusiasm, I believe FEBs can continue to be instrumental in supporting Presidential initiatives and programs. They can set an example in such areas of critical concern as improvement of management of resources in limited or short supply, encouragement of energy efficiency, productivity, and the restoration of confidence in government.
Please make your senior officials in the field aware of the importance of their continuing involvement with and support of FEBs. It is a very worthwhile effort.
