    Throughout National Diabetes Month, we reaffirm our continued efforts to discover better solutions for the more than 34 million Americans living with diabetes today.
Facing the threat of diabetes head on—particularly in our aging population—is a top priority of my administration. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and approximately a third are prediabetic, meaning they are at a high risk of developing it.
Through innovative policies, we are confronting the public health challenge of diabetes head on. The United States has increased efforts to reduce the prevalence of diabetes, namely through increased physical activity and changes to our diets. For those living with diabetes during the pandemic, the increased risk of experiencing poor clinical outcomes if diagnosed with COVID-19 is an extra burden, particularly for the elderly and those with other chronic conditions. That is why my administration has taken action to provide many seniors in Medicare Part D plans with access to a broad set of insulins at a maximum $35 copay for a month's supply and started covering newer insulin delivery devices. We have also made great strides to make prescription drugs, including antidiabetic drugs, more affordable and accessible. Since I took office, we have approved the largest number of generic drugs in history, and prescription drug prices declined for the first time in nearly 50 years. Improving the price and accessibility of medications to manage diabetes enhances quality of life and provides security for patients and their loved ones.
As we collectively observe National Diabetes Month, the First Lady and I pray for the millions of Americans who are living with this condition. Together, we will continue working towards innovative and affordable cures and therapies to secure a healthier future for all.
