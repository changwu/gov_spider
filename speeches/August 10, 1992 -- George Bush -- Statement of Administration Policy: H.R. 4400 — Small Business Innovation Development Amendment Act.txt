    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Skelton (D) Missouri and 47 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 4400 but will seek an amendment in the Senate to delete the new Small Business Technology Transfer program. This new program would establish a set aside from the research and development budgets of certain Federal agencies for proposals from small businesses for technology transfer. Such a program is not necessary and will detract from other research priorities. Current authorities, including the Federal Technology Transfer Act, already authorize and encourage technology transfer for commercial use.
