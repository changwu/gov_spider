    Today I am signing into law S. 680, the "Tourism Policy and Export Promotion Act of 1992." The Act authorizes appropriations for the United States Travel and Tourism Administration. This Federal agency promotes the United States as an international travel destination. It assists small and medium-sized U.S. travel and tourism companies in entering and competing in the international market.
The travel and tourism industry is America's third largest retail industry. It employs over six million workers, making it America's third largest employer. In 1991, travel and tourism generated $344 billion in receipts, accounting for a trade surplus of $16.8 billion. Both receipts and the surplus are expected to grow even larger in 1992. The health of this industry is important to our economic recovery.
In signing this legislation, I must note my concerns with one provision. S. 680 would establish the Rural Tourism Development Foundation as a charitable and nonprofit corporation to assist in the development and promotion of rural tourism. Although most of the provisions in the Act demonstrate an intent to establish the Foundation as a private entity, there are certain provisions that undermine this conclusion. Entities that are neither clearly governmental nor clearly private should not be created because they blur the distinction between public and private entities in a way that may diminish the political accountability of Government.
On balance, I believe the Congress intended to create the Foundation as a private entity. However, in order to remove any doubt as to the nature of the Foundation, I instruct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to prepare legislation for submission to the next Congress to amend this Act to ensure that the Foundation is considered solely a private entity.
