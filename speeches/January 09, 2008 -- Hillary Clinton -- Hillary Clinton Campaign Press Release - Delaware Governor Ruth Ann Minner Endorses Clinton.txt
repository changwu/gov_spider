    Governor Ruth Ann Minner of Delaware today announced she is endorsing Hillary Clinton for President.
"Hillary Clinton has a proven track record of making change happen, and getting results. She had a goal of expanding health care to low income children, and as a result, over six million kids nationwide have health insurance today. Concerned that National Guard and Reservists were not receiving adequate health care, she teamed up with Republicans and Democrats and passed legislation guaranteeing them health care, regardless of their deployment status. We need Hillary's results-oriented leadership and commitment to change in the White House to move our country forward."
"Governor Minner has spent over three decades working for the people of Delaware, and as governor, has created thousands of new jobs and continues to expand educational opportunities for Delaware students," said Clinton. "I am truly honored to have her support."
Governor Minner was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974, where she served four terms, then served three terms in the state Senate. Minner served as Lieutenant Governor from 1993-2001, and was elected the first female Governor of Delaware in 2000.
As Governor, Minner has successfully created and retained nearly 65,000 jobs in Delaware and has passed measures to strengthen education standards and modernize Delaware's public schools. A fierce protector of the environment, Minner signed a multi-state agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses and is a frequent promoter of alternative energy sources.
Minner announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton after previously supporting Sen. Joe Biden. Delaware will hold its primary on February 5.
