    President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke today by phone about recent developments in the P5+1 negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program and Israeli-Palestinian relations following the Palestinian application to join the International Criminal Court (ICC). The President reaffirmed to the Prime Minister that the United States is focused on reaching a comprehensive deal with Iran that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and verifiably assures the international community of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program. The President underscored the United States' enduring commitment to the security of Israel and the importance of continuing close cooperation with Israel on this issue.
On the Palestinian ICC bid, President Obama reiterated the United States' position that the Palestinian Authority does not yet constitute a state and is therefore not eligible to accede to the Rome Statute. President Obama underscored that the United States does not believe Palestinian accession to the ICC is a constructive way forward. The United States continues to strongly oppose actions by both parties that undermine trust and encourages both sides to seek ways to deescalate tensions.
