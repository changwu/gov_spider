    In the summer of 2011, the Washington establishment pinned its hopes on a so-called 'Super Committee' of 12 Congressmen and Senators to solve America's deficit and spending problems. The Committee was established with a law that imposed mandatory cuts to defense and other programs as a threat to force action.
At the time, Newt Gingrich was alone in calling this "Super Committee" what it was: "a truly dumb idea." Today, Newt 2012 released a new web video, with clips from the August 11th presidential debate in Iowa, where Newt was the leading critic of the "Super Committee" and predicted its failure.
We need a president with the experience of balancing the federal budget and reforming government if we are going to get our fiscal house in order. That's Newt.
Transcript of Newt's quotes in the video:
"I think this Super Committee is about as dumb an idea as Washington has come up with in my lifetime."
"I used to run the House of Representatives, I have some general notion of these things. The idea that 523 senators and congressman are going to sit around for 4 months while 12 brilliant people -- mostly picked for political reasons -- are going to sit in some room and brilliantly come up with $1 trillion, or force us to choose between gutting our military and accepting a tax increase is irrational."
"They're going to walk in just before Thanksgiving and say 'Alright, we can shoot you in the head or cut off your right leg, which do you prefer?'"
"What they oughta do is scrap the committee right now, recognize it's a dumb idea, go back to regular legislative business, assign every subcommittee the task of finding savings, do it out in the open through regular legislative order, and get rid of this secret phony business."
