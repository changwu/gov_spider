    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Coble (R) North Carolina)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 672.
Pay-As-You Go Scoring
H.R. 672 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB is developing its preliminary PAYGO estimate.
