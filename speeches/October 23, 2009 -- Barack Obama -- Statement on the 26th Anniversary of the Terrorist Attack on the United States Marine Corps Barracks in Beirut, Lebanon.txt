    We remember today the 241 American marines, soldiers, and sailors who lost their lives 26 years ago as the result of a horrific terrorist attack that destroyed the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. The military personnel serving in Beirut were there to bring peace and stability to Lebanon after years of internal strife and conflict. The murder of our soldiers, sailors, and marines on this day on 1983 remains a senseless tragedy.
We pay tribute on this day to the courage and sacrifice of those whose lives were lost in the Beirut attack, as well as their families and loved ones. We also wish to honor the brave service of all members of the United States military who are protecting Americans and promoting freedom and security around the world, as well as those international peacekeepers who serve in harm's way.
In remembering this terrible day of loss, we are at the same time hopeful that a new Government in Lebanon will soon be formed. We look forward to working with a Lebanese Government that works actively to promote stability in the region and prosperity for its people.
