Time's Joe Klein: "I watched tonight's debate with the Frank Luntz focus group at the famed Merrimack Diner... And they...Just. Loved. Romney." (Joe Klein, "McCain's Lost Weekend," Time's Swampland Blog, http://www.time-blog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Klein: "Most of those who came in undecided had switched to Mitt by the end of the show. They just adored his position on illegal immigration (their dials plummeted when McCain said we had to be 'humane.')" (Joe Klein, "McCain's Lost Weekend," Time's Swampland Blog, http://www.time-blog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)

Fox News' Carl Cameron: "Romney was seated in the middle, and he was in the middle of every exchange. He stuck to his guns and fired several good shots of his own. He let almost no charge go un-rebutted and pivoted to offense effectively on many. As far as debating tactics, poise and execution are concerned he won." (Carl Cameron, "Mitt In The Middle," FOX's Cameron's Corner, http://cameron.blogs.foxnews.com/, Posted 1/7/08)
- Cameron: "He withstood withering condescension from his rivals, tough questions from Chris Wallace, all after a full campaign day. Romney has campaigned harder and for longer than all of them." (Carl Cameron, "Mitt In The Middle," FOX's Cameron's Corner, http://cameron.blogs.foxnews.com/, Posted 1/7/08)
- Cameron: "Mitt Romney scored spectacular numbers in Frank Luntz's focus groups." (Carl Cameron, "Mitt In The Middle," FOX's Cameron's Corner, http://cameron.blogs.foxnews.com/, Posted 1/7/08)

Politico's Jonathan Martin: "Overall, Romney was much more effective at driving his message this evening, taking advantage of numerous opportunities to talk up his new theme of bringing change to Washington. He was able to discuss taxes and immigration – precisely the issues his campaign wants to spotlight here before the primary – and seemed at ease and relaxed the whole time." (Jonathan Martin, "From Smackdown To Somnolent," Politico, http://www.politico.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
CBN's David Brody: "Mitt Romney picked a great time to come up with a solid homerun debate performance." (David Brody, "Romney's Smashing Success," CBN's The Brody File, http://www.cbn.com/, 1/6/08)
Brody: "Billed as a 'Presidential Forum', Romney looked presidential and pretty much commanded the roundtable without coming across as petty and vindictive. This is called 'coming through at crunch time.'" (David Brody, "Romney's Smashing Success," CBN's The Brody File, http://www.cbn.com/, 1/6/08)

Race 4 2008's Matthew E. Miller: "I really think Mitt Romney has come into his own over the last few days. In particular, I thought he was fantastic tonight." (Matthew E. Miller, "A Comeback Kid?" Race 4 2008 Blog, http://race42008.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Miller: "On just style alone, I think he's bowled over even the usually engaging Huckabee, two nights in a row." (Matthew E. Miller, "A Comeback Kid?" Race 4 2008 Blog, http://race42008.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Miller: "But, beyond style, Romney has shown a staggering command of issues and details. He continually projects competence and seriousness, with well-thought out responses to tough questions." (Matthew E. Miller, "A Comeback Kid?" Race 4 2008 Blog, http://race42008.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Miller: "Last night, Romney bore a brutal assault amazingly well, but tonight he actually won, because he not only seemed like the grown-up in the room, but the other candidates took a respite from their vicious anti-Romney glee." (Matthew E. Miller, "A Comeback Kid?" Race 4 2008 Blog, http://race42008.com/, Posted 1/6/08)

RedState's Leon Wolf: "Let's be clear - for the purposes of New Hampshire, tonight was about who could win between McCain and Romney, and Romney was the clear winner." (Leon Wolf, "Mitt Romney's Finest Hour," RedState Blog, http://www.redstate.com/, Posted 1/7/08)
- Wolf: "Romney was clearly on his game." (Leon Wolf, "Mitt Romney's Finest Hour," RedState Blog, http://www.redstate.com/, Posted 1/7/08)
- Wolf: "Romney clearly impressed the focus groups, and spoke to issues that appeal to the folks of New Hampshire." (Leon Wolf, "Mitt Romney's Finest Hour," RedState Blog, http://www.redstate.com/, Posted 1/7/08)
