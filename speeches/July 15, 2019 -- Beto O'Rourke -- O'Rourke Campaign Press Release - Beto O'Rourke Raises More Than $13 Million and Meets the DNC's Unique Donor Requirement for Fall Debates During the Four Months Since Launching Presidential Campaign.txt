    Beto's campaign added more than $3.6 million in Q2 with an average donation of $30, without a dime from PACs, corporations or federal lobbyists
EL PASO, TEXAS -- Beto O'Rourke raised more than $13 million during the first four months of his presidential campaign from nearly 200,000 donors across the country. His more than $3.6 million in Q2 came from 119,888 contributions with an average donation of $30.
Beto has officially met the DNC's 130,000 unique donor requirement for the fall primary debates. Relying on small-dollar donations and with teachers, nurses, and students across the nation as the top contributors by occupation, 98% of the contributions made during Q2 were below $200. A full 99% of the Q2 fundraising came in online. The campaign received donations from every single state and D.C. during the three month FEC reporting period.
Signaling growing grassroots support, nearly half -- 48% -- of the contributors who pitched in during Q2 were new donors to Beto's presidential campaign.
