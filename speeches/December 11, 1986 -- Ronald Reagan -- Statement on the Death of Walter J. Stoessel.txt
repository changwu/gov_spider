    Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel was a dedicated and talented public servant. With pride, competence, and grace, he represented our country as Ambassador to Poland, the Soviet Union, and the Federal Republic of Germany. He earned the respect and admiration of those with whom he worked, and he was an effective and articulate advocate of our foreign policy goals. As Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Deputy Secretary of State, Walter Stoessel served his country with distinction and a deep sense of patriotism. He was motivated by the goal which all diplomats share: making the world a better place for their fellow men. I will miss Walter Stoessel's wise counsel. Nancy and I extend our deepest sympathy to Mary Ann and their family.
