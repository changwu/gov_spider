In 1987, Joe Biden Told A Questioner "I Think I Probably Have A Much Higher IQ Than You Do." "'I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do,' Biden snapped. Nor did he let it go at that, replying that he was graduated from law school in the top half of his class and suggesting that the questioner was 'a heartless technocrat' for caring more about law school grade averages than about leadership abilities. Biden made his remarks during one of those meet-the-candidate gatherings that do not rate extensive coverage. But a C-Span camera was there, homing in on Biden's mirthless grin as he chewed out the hapless questioner." (Frank Clifford, "Face-Offs Proliferate," Los Angeles Times, 7/25/87)
