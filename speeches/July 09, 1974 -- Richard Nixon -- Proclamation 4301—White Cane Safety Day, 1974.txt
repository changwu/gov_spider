  A Proclamation

More than a million Americans have severe visual disabilities. A few years ago most of these individuals would have been condemned to a life of dependence upon others. But a simple device—a White Cane—has given most of them mobility and with it, independence.
If those blessed with the gift of good eyesight do their part, those who are denied this blessing may still enjoy the independence they must have to work and support themselves and, not infrequently, their families. They can enjoy the independence they need to be fulltime partners in the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness which more fortunate Americans enjoy.
We should be constantly aware of the significance of the White Cane and, without hesitation, extend every courtesy to those who carry it. In this way we can respect the privacy and independence of our visually disabled while, at the same time, assuring that we do nothing to hinder their ability to shape and pursue a productive and fulfilling life.
In recognition of the significance of the White Cane, the Congress, by a joint resolution of October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), authorized the President to proclaim October 15 of each year as White Cane Safety Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1974, as White Cane Safety Day.
I urge all Americans to mark this occasion by giving greater consideration to the special needs of the visually handicapped, and particularly by learning to heed the White Cane in order that our visually handicapped may use our streets and public facilities with maximum safety.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.

RICHARD NIXON
