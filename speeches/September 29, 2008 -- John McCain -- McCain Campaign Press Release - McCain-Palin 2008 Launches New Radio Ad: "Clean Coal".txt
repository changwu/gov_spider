    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest radio ad, entitled "Clean Coal." The ad highlights the Obama-Biden energy plan that opposes coal and clean coal technology. For states like Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, that would mean thousands of lost jobs. Unlike Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the McCain-Palin "all of the above" energy plan will invest critical resources into developing clean coal technology and creating jobs.

In Springfield, Missouri, Barack Obama Said That Oil Drilling Will Not "Solve Our Problem" And That "It's Not Real." "'If I thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem, I'd do it ... This is not real. I know it's tempting. The polls say the majority of Americans think it's one way we'll resolve our problems, but it's not real." (John Whitesides, "Obama, McCain Duel Over Celebrity Ad, Attacks," Reuters, 7/30/08) 
Barack Obama Called Offshore Drilling A "Scheme." Obama: "Now the latest scheme is well, we're going to drill offshore. Now, I want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this. If I thought that I could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of California and New Jersey, I understand how desperate folks are. I met a guy who couldn't go on a job search that lost his job, couldn't go on a job search because of the high price of gas. Just couldn't fill up his tank. I met a teacher in South Dakota who loved her job as a teacher on an Indian reservation, she had to quit because the drive was too far, it was taking up too much of her paycheck. I know how bad people are hurting. So If I thought that by drilling offshore, we could solve our problem, I'd do it." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks At Campaign Event, Springfield, MO, 7/30/08)
