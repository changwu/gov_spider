    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/18/92 )(House)(Gephardt (D) Missouri and Michel (R) Illinois)
The Administration supports enactment of H.J. Res. 512.
PAY-As-You-Go Scoring
H.J. Res. 512 affects receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB estimates that enactment of this resolution would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this proposal may deviate from this estimate. If H.J. Res. 512 is enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all legislation on direct spending and revenue will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
