Out-of-town pool report #7: Press sec on WH and coronavirus
Judd Deere forwards:
"Reports that the White House has issued formal guidelines to staff instructing them to limit in-person interactions and meetings are completely false. While we have asked all Americans to exercise common-sense hygiene measures, we are conducting business as usual. I want to remind the media once again to be responsible with all reporting."

WH Pool Report 1 -- updated gather time for arrival
Good afternoon.
The White House press office just sent out an updated final gather time of 3:10 pm EDT at the Palm Room doors for the president's arrival on Marine 1.



March 9, 202015:31 

WH pool report 2 — no questions
Marine 1 descended out of a soft blue sky with a few wispy cirrus clouds and settled onto the South Lawn at 1519.
Pool had been told to position at the West Wing side of the driveway, but Trump instead walked directly toward the residence.
A mad dash ensued, but he took no shouted questions and entered the building at 1522.
A few minutes later he led a dozen or so along the colonnade to the West Wing, watching and pointing as the helicopter throttled up and flew off.



March 9, 202017:31 

WH Pool Report 3 -- Coronavirus briefing pushed to 6
There was an announcement over the loudspeakers that the briefing will begin at 6.
Reminder -- the briefing is open press.



March 9, 202018:05 

WH Pool Report 4 -- make that 6:30
It was just announced that the coronavirus briefing has now been pushed to 1830.



March 9, 202018:36 

WH Pool Report 5 -- Trump arrives
The president entered the briefing room at 1834 and has begun with his statement.
This event is open press.



March 9, 202018:54 

WH Pool Report 6 -- Trump leaves -- ignores question about whether he has been tested
The president gave a statement for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, in which he said:
- His administration is taking proposals to Congress about reducing the payroll tax, finding a solution to workers who do not have paid sick leave who might not want to self-quarantine for fear of losing paychecks, helping the cruise industry.- He also said he has done a great job by closing the borders, something which had never been done.*
After Pence spoke for 7 minutes on these topics, Trump again stepped to the lectern, said he would have a press conference tomorrow about those issues, and repeated that he has done a great job -- "This blindsided the world, and I think we've done a very, very good job." -- and then left.
He ignored a shouted question about whether he has been tested for the virus.
After he left, Pence said he didn't know if Trump had been tested, but that he would find out.
[* This was not an accurate statement. Your pooler recommends due diligence.]
More quotes to come ASAP.
The briefing continues with members of the Coronavirus Task Force.



March 9, 202019:38 

WH Pool Report 7 -- More complete quotes
Trump said he would be pushing a payroll tax cut – "substantial relief… it's a big number" – as well as help for hourly workers who do not have sick leave so they don't have to worry about missing paychecks if they self-quarantine.
"So they don't get penalized for something that's not their fault." He then described how he has done a great job already:
"We have been handling it really well. We made the decision early when we shut down our borders. We were the first ones ever to do that. We've never done that in our country before."
[NB – the president did not "close our borders." He imposed bans on foreign nationals from entering the country from, at first, China, and then also Iran and certain regions of Italy and South Korea.]
He then said he will be working with the Small Business Administration to make loans for small businesses, and with the airline, cruise ship and hotel industries.
"We'll be working with them very, very strongly."
"We'll be taking care of the American public."
NOTE: Here is the corrected quote from his second visit to the lectern: "This blindsided the world, and I think we've handled it very, very well."



March 9, 202019:42 

WH Pool Report 8 -- Lid
Apparently the press office called a travel/photo lid for the evening at about 1925.
Bonne nuit.



March 9, 202022:02 

WH Pool Report 9 — Trump has not had the coronavirus test
This from the WH:
From Stephanie Grisham:
The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms. President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.
Per current CDC guidelines, medical professionals should base testing decisions on patient symptoms and exposure history.
