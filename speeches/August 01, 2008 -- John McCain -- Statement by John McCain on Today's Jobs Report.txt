    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on the jobs report:
"Across this country, Americans are hurting and today's job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face. We must enact a Jobs for America plan that supports job creation and helps small businesses, which even in these tough economic times are creating jobs.
"Unlike Senator Obama, I do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems. There is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses. The American people cannot afford economic policies that will take us backward."
