    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement regarding Earth Day:
"In 1970, our nation recognized the first Earth Day as millions of Americans affirmed their commitment to being good stewards of our environment. Today, Americans will join those from across the world in reaffirming that commitment. Whether it is clean air, safe and healthy water, conserving open space or sustainable land use, we are called upon to protect our natural treasures for our children, grandchildren and future generations.
"As President, I will ensure that we protect all of nature's blessings while recognizing that our environmental and economic interests are not mutually exclusive. In this, we must work together -- the government, environmental and conservation groups, business and the public -- in a manner that fulfills our responsibilities to the environment.
"On this Earth Day, we must also look ahead to the serious threats that confront our environment today. We must have the courage to realistically confront the specter of climate change. This is one of the greatest challenges confronting the next President. On this issue, I will act to safeguard our environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels in a manner that spurs innovation of cleaner, more reliable energy sources.
"Let us commemorate Earth Day by committing to meet our obligation as creation's caretakers and ensure that our children and grandchildren do not have to face the challenges that we have failed to meet."
