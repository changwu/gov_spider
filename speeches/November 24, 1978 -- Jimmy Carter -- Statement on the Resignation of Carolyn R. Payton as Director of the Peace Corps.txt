    I have come to the conclusion that there are unresolvable policy differences between the Director of ACTION, Sam Brown, and the Director of one of its major agencies, the Peace Corps, Dr. Carolyn Payton. In order to carry out the important programs of ACTION and to resolve this serious impasse, I am today accepting the resignation of Dr. Payton as Director of the Peace Corps.
This does not in any way reflect on the competence, integrity, or sincerity of Dr. Payton. I wish to express my appreciation to her for the good service which she has rendered.
