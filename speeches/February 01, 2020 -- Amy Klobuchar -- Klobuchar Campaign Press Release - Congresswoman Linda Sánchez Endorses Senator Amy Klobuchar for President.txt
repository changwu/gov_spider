    Two Days Before Iowa Caucuses, Sánchez Throws Her Support Behind Klobuchar
MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Today, two days before the Iowa Caucuses, Congresswoman Linda Sánchez (CA-38) announced her endorsement of Senator Amy Klobuchar for President citing her track record and history of delivering real results.
"Our number one priority in this election is defeating Donald Trump and Senator Amy Klobuchar is the best candidate to take him on," said Congresswoman Linda Sánchez. "Amy not only has bold, progressive policies and an optimistic economic agenda, she also has a proven track record of delivering real results as I've seen in the Senate. Amy will be a President for all of America and I'm proud to support her in this campaign."
Nationally recognized as a leading progressive voice in Congress for working families, Congresswoman Linda Sánchez has fought to strengthen communities by helping small businesses create more good-paying jobs, increasing access to educational opportunities, and helping hard-working people get ahead.
Congresswoman Sánchez served as Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus in the 115th Congress (2017-2019), the fifth-highest ranking position in House Democratic Leadership. In this leadership position, she focused on strengthening the American Dream for men and women all across the country. Congresswoman Sánchez is the first Latina elected to a leadership position in the U.S. Congress.
The endorsement comes on the heels of endorsements from the Quad-City Times, the New York Times and three New Hampshire papers: the New Hampshire Union Leader, The Keene Sentinel, and the Seacoast Media Group.
