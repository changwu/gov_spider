    I commend the Government of Algeria for taking an important step forward today by formally lifting the state of emergency that has been in place in Algeria for 19 years. This is a positive sign that the Government of Algeria is listening to the concerns and responding to the aspirations of its people, and we look forward to additional steps by the Government that enable the Algerian people to fully exercise their universal rights, including freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The United States is committed to continuing our cooperation with the Government of Algeria as it works to represent and meet the needs of all Algerians. We will also continue speaking up for universal freedoms, justice, and the dignity of every human being.
