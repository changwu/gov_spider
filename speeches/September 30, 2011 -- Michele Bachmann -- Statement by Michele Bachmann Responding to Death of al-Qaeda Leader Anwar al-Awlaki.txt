    Charlotte, NC â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann released the following reaction to the strategic U.S. attack that killed a major al-Qaeda operative:
"The United States military and our intelligence community have demonstrated again why they are the best in the world. With the greatest of skill, they successfully took out Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda leader known for recruiting terrorists who would carry out deadly plots against innocent Americans. As one of the most-wanted terrorists, al-Awlaki was linked to the tragic and deadly shooting at Fort Hood, and was connected to a failed attempt to bomb a U.S. bound passenger jet on Christmas Day 2009.
"I want to applaud and thank our men and women in uniform, and those who gather intelligence, for their brave and sacrificial work. We know that enemies of freedom, like al-Awlaki, are relentlessly bent on the destruction of our great country. They wake up every morning seeking new ways to terrorize and kill. But, once again, the courageous fighting force of the United States of America has defeated them."
