"Following the Columbine shootings, Peggy Noonan, you may have seen her column, wrote an article in which she described our world as 'the ocean in which our children now swim.' She described a cesspool of violence, and sex, and drugs, and indolence, and perversions. She said that the boys who did the shooting had in her words 'inhaled too deep the ocean in which they swam.' I'd like to see us clean up the water in which our kids are swimming."
