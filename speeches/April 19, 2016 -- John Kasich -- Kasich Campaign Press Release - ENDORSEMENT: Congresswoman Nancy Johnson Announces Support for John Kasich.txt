    
Today, former Congresswoman Nancy Johnson (R-CT) endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president. 
"Governor John Kasich is both the only candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton and the only candidate who has what it takes to renew accountability and trust in government," said Johnson. "I worked with John when he served in Congress and together, we fought for responsible solutions that put the country first to help more Americans get ahead. I know that will continue to be his focus and mission as president. I am proud to support him and I call on my fellow citizens in Connecticut to do the same on April 26."

Congresswoman Johnson represented Connecticut's fifth and sixth districts from 1983-2007.
 "I am honored to have the endorsement of Congresswoman Johnson," said Kasich. "She always put people, not the party, first. In the House, she was a strong voice for her constituents. It means a great deal to have her support as we move forward to the convention in July."
