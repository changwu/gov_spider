    We are deeply concerned by, and strongly disagree with, today's decision by a federal district court ordering the release into the United States -- by this Friday morning -- of 17 Uighurs currently held at Guantanamo Bay. This decision, we believe, is contrary to our laws, including federal immigration statutes passed by Congress. The Department of Justice intends to seek emergency relief tonight to stay the court's order and to request a prompt reversal of the order by the Court of Appeals. The district court's ruling, if allowed to stand, could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11, who may also seek release into our country.
Consistent with the safety of our citizens and the safety of the Uighurs themselves, the United States will continue working to find a country to which these men could be transferred.
