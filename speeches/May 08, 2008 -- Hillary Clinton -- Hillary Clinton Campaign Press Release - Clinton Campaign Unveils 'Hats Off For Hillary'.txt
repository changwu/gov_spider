    Demonstrating Hillary's strong commitment to breast cancer awareness, the Clinton campaign today unveiled its 'ËœHats off for Hillary' drive in Kentucky. The drive, which will take place until May 20, will encourage women across the state to donate their Kentucky Derby hats to charity.
"Hats off for Hillary is just another example of the strong commitment Hillary has shown to fighting breast cancer and raising awareness," said former Miss America and Hillary supporter Heather French Henry. "Hillary is the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to eradicate breast cancer in our lifetime. We look forward to working with other Kentuckians to raise even more awareness."
Kentucky women interested in participating in 'Hats off for Hillary' can drop their derby hats at any Clinton Campaign office in the state. All derby hats will be donated to "Hats for Hope," a charity which supports the American Cancer Society's "Making Strides for Breast Cancer" initiative.
