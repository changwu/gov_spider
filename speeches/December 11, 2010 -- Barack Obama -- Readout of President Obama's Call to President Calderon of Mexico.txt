President Obama congratulated President Calderon for his leadership and Mexico's excellent work chairing the Cancun conference to a successful conclusion that builds on the historic Copenhagen Accord and advances the effort to address the challenge of climate change.
The Presidents also underscored the importance of the U.S.-Mexico partnership across a broad range of issues and reaffirmed their shared commitment to work together against transnational criminal organizations, to enhance border cooperation, and to improve the economic well being of people in both countries. The Presidents discussed the deplorable actions by WikiLeaks and agreed its irresponsible acts should not distract our two countries from our important cooperation.
