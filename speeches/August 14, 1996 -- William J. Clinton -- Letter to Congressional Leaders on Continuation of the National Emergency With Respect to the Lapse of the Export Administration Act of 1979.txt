    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On August 19, 1994, in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.), I issued Executive Order No. 12924 declaring a national emergency and continuing the system of export regulation under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). Under section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice of its continuation.
I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12924. Attached is a copy of the notice of extension.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
