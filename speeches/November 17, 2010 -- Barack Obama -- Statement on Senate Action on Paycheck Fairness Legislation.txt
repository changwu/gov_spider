    I am deeply disappointed that a minority of Senators have prevented the "Paycheck Fairness Act" from finally being brought up for a debate and receiving a vote. This bill passed in the House almost 2 years ago; today it had 58 votes to move forward, the support of the majority of Senate, and the support of the majority of Americans. As we emerge from one of the worst recessions in history, this bill would ensure that American women and their families aren't bringing home smaller paychecks because of discrimination. It also helps businesses that pay equal wages as they struggle to compete against discriminatory competition. But a partisan minority of Senators blocked this commonsense law. Despite today's vote, my administration will continue to fight for a woman's right to equal pay for equal work.
