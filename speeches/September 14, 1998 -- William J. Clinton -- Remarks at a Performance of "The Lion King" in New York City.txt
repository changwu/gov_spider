    Thank you so much. I will be very brief tonight. For one thing, you need to know that I have to be brief tonight because if we're not out of here, with all the pictures taken, by 11:30, we kick into overtime—[laughter]—and we dilute the impact of your contributions in November. [Laughter] And I don't want to do that.
But I do want to say to Peter, to Tom, to the incredible cast and the musicians, I found myself looking back and forth—I have a cricked neck from looking at these two percussionists here who were so magnificent tonight. Thank you very much.
And I just want to thank you all for giving us a night we'll never forget in this magnificent theater. I also want to thank all of you for being here, for being here for Hillary and me and Al and Tipper, for what we have done for the last 6 years and what we can do in the next 2 and what we should do in November.
This is a very, very important time. The stakes are high; the issues are clear. I knew Al Gore was going to stand up here and say that Scar was the embodiment of the other guys. [Laughter] That's what happens when you think you can destroy the environment while you grow the economy. I knew he was thinking that. I knew he was thinking that.
Hillary said the same thing. Hillary said, "That's what happens if those Republicans that have the House get the whole thing. Look at that." [Laughter]
Well, we do believe in the balance of forces and the balance of people and in bringing everybody into our big tent. We believe that all the animals in the jungles can live together if they have peace in their heart.
So I want you to leave here determined to make your investment good, remembering why you came, proud of it, and touching everyone you can now about what is still at issue in this great, great cause.
Thank you, God bless you, and good night.
