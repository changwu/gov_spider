    Dear Nelson:
I thank you and the other members of the President's Panel on Federal Compensation for your report of the Panel's recommendations. All of you are to be commended for the tremendous effort you put into this study.
Your assessment of the current Federal Compensation System is very important and timely. It provides the Administration with a valuable tool to improve the Federal pay system so that it is equitable and fair to both Government employees and the American public.
Once again, thank you for a job well done.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[The Honorable Nelson A. Rockefeller, The Vice President of the United States, Washington, D.C.]
