    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dymally (D) California and Fauntroy (D) District of Columbia)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4257 because it superimposes a new and unnecessary Supreme Court on the District of Columbia court system, resulting in a wasteful proliferation of appeals and an unwarranted burden on litigants.
