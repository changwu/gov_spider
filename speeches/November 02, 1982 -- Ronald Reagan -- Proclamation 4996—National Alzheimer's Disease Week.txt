  A Proclamation

Alzheimer's disease, a major brain disorder, results in the progressive loss of mental faculties, often beginning with impairment of memory, learning, attention, and judgment. While some types of dementia are curable, Alzheimer's disease is not. In time, it erodes thought, feeling, and behavior and leads to death. Family members and friends of the afflicted fully comprehend the special suffering imposed by this depersonalizing illness.
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders represent a health problem of enormous dimensions. Thanks to progress in neurobiological research, we know that Alzheimer's disease is not, as once thought, a normal consequence of aging. Rather, it is a pathological deviation from the normâ€”and as such must be susceptible to prevention or treatment once its underlying cause or causes are known. Alzheimer's disease is being fought through several approaches; promising early studies are spurring further vigorous research.
The fight against Alzheimer's disease needs many allies. I salute the many Americans who are working for increased public awareness of this baffling disorder and the scientists whose research holds the promise of hope.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, in accordance with House Joint Resolution 496, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 21 through November 27, 1982, as "National Alzheimer's Disease Week," and I call upon government agencies and the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 2nd day of Nov., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
