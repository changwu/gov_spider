LAKE JACKSON, Texas - The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today its new ad 'Betrayal' aimed at Rick Santorum.
The ad will begin airing on Monday, January 9th on television in the key early voting state of South Carolina. In addition, the campaign has arranged for internet promotion on websites where conservatives congregate.
'Betrayal' exposes Rick Santorum as another serial hypocrite in the vein of Newt Gingrich, showcasing the former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania's record of duplicity on issues such as spending - including raising the debt ceiling - and insider lobbying. The ad also features Santorum's appalling record on right to work, an issue dear to South Carolina residents but one of pivotal importance right now due to the NLRB-Boeing dispute. The ad also includes Rick Santorum's now-infamous confession that he is, in his own words, "no longer a deficit hawk."
"Ron Paul can come to South Carolina with a clear conscience and an impeccable record on the issues important to voters there: fiscal restraint, right to work, and strict adherence to the Constitution and one's own promises. In addition, Dr. Paul has support from many of our armed services men and women," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"This ad showcases the real Rick Santorum and it's the reason why Santorum should be leery of competing in the 'First in the South' Republican primary, and it is why we hope for a strong, competitive showing in the Palmetto State," added Mr. Benton.
