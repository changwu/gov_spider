    Memorandum for All Federal Civilian Employees and Military Personnel
The promise of America is contained in our Constitution whose bicentennial we celebrate this year. Let us take the opportunity provided by the 1987-88 Combined Federal Campaign to help all Americans participate in our Nation's promise.
Your history of increasing generosity over nearly three decades of voluntary giving demonstrates your continuing concern for the needy in the United States and around the world.
You have a record of unselfishness and concern for others that is unsurpassed. I am proud of you all. I am confident that your outstanding past performance will continue in this year's Campaign. While the decision to give is personal and voluntary, I encourage each of you to join me in wholeheartedly supporting the 1987-88 Combined Federal Campaign.
RONALD REAGAN
