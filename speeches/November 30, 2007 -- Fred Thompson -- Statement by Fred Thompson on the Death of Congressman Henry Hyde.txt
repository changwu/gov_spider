    McLean, VA - Senator Fred Thompson released the following statement today on the life of Henry Hyde:
"Henry Hyde was a true conservative hero. He was a patriot, a leader, a man who defended freedom and who understood America's standing in the world and the need for us to lead, and most importantly, a man who defended life. The Hyde Amendment placed the U.S. government on the side of respecting human dignity and has served our nation well."
