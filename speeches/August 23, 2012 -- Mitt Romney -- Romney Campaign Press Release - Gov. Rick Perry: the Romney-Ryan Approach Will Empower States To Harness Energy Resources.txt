    Texas Governor Rick Perry made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"The Romney-Ryan energy plan will spark job creation, unleash our nation's vast domestic energy resources, and free states' energy sectors from an overreaching, activist Obama Administration. From stifling energy producers with onerous taxes and regulations to ignoring states' successful efforts to clean their air while protecting jobs, President Obama has made it clear he cares more about keeping job creators fighting misguided bureaucrats than allowing them to create a stronger economic climate that our nation so desperately needs. As governor of the nation's largest energy producing state, I understand what tools states need to maintain a thriving energy industry. Mitt Romney's state-focused, all of the above approach is exactly what will empower us to harness our energy resources, achieve energy independence, and provide a regulatory framework that will foster job creation, and reward instead of punish those who invest in our energy economy."
