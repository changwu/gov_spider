    The earthquake which struck southern Italy on the evening of Sunday, November 23, was the worst natural disaster to strike Western Europe in half a century. Human suffering—from the anguish of those with families buried under the rubble to the misery of survivors without shelter in the face of cruel winter storms—is incalculable.
The death toll mounts as the missing become confirmed dead. Well over 3,000 have died, and at least 200,000 are homeless. The Italian Government and its people have mobilized their resources. Army, police, firemen, and volunteers work to the limit of their strength in rescue efforts.
But the Italian effort is not enough. The international community must help and is doing so. The United States is doing its part. I have asked our Agency for International Development office of foreign disaster assistance to respond swiftly to Italian requests, and it has already made available more than $3.5 million in relief supplies. U.S. military personnel in Italy are cooperating closely with international donors and Italian officials. An American delegation will be sent to Italy.
Congress moved quickly and generously in 1976 following a serious earthquake in Italy's northeast. Last week's disaster was far more tragic and destructive. The reconstruction effort will be enormous. The Italian Government will need help in meeting the burden, and the United States must join with others in providing that help. Therefore, I fully encourage congressional initiative to provide up to $50 million for Italian earthquake relief and to support reconstruction. I urge swift passage of the appropriate legislation. This U.S. aid will be made available when an adequate system for accepting and distributing the funds is established.
