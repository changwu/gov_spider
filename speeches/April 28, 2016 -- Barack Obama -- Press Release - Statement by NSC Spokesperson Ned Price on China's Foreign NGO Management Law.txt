    The United States is deeply concerned that China's new Law on the Management of Foreign NGO Activities will further narrow space for civil society in China and constrain contact between individuals and organizations in the United States and China. Recognizing that a vibrant civil society is a cornerstone of stability and prosperity, the Administration has expressed strong support at every level for the role of civil society in China. We urge China to respect the rights and freedoms of human rights defenders, journalists, business groups, development professionals, and all others who make up civil society, including by protecting the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in China.
