    In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson, Governor Scott McCallum and former Congressman Scott Klug released the following statement in support of Ohio Governor John Kasich for president.
"Only one candidate in this race has the temperament, experience and vision to be president and it's Ohio Governor John Kasich. He has the proven record of turning an economy around by bringing more than 400,000 jobs to Ohio while also turning an $8 billion budget shortfall into a $2 billion surplus. Further, after serving 8 years on the House Armed Services Committee, Kasich is equipped and ready to be Commander-in-Chief to keep our nation safe.
"John Kasich isn't just the leader we want and the proven leader we need, he is the only person who can defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall. Poll after poll, including Wisconsin's gold standard, the recently released Marquette Law Poll, shows that a vote for Donald Trump or Ted Cruz will put Hillary Clinton back in the White House to continue the sluggish legacy of the Obama economy and further weaken our country, increasing America's exposure to international and domestic threats."
"In this election where experience, real solutions and winning matter only John Kasich has what it takes to go all the way."
