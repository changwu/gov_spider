    The United States and Poland will sign an Open Skies air transport agreement on June 18, 2001. The accord demonstrates the growing ties between the United States and Poland. It provides a basis for the development of significant new commercial opportunities for both counties and facilitates new cooperation between U.S. and Polish airlines.
Compared to the existing agreement that was reached in 1988, the new agreement represents a substantial expansion in air transport opportunities for airlines of both countries. By the time the agreement becomes fully effective in January 2004, U.S. airlines will have access to all of Poland while Polish airlines will have access to the entire United States. Last year, some 355,077 passengers traveled between the U.S. and Poland on the Polish national airline, LOT. There will be no limits on frequency or the number of flights.
Open Skies agreements permit unrestricted air service by the airlines of both countries between and beyond the other's territory, eliminating restrictions on how often the carriers can fly, the kind of aircraft they use and the prices they charge. The United States now has negotiated over 50 Open Skies agreements with partners in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East.
