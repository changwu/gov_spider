    "At a time when nearly 23 million Americans are struggling for work, President Obama has sacrificed thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue by targeting Virginia's offshore drilling efforts. This is just the latest example of a president who is more interested in playing politics than creating jobs and getting the economy moving again." -Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
The Obama Administration Has Fought Offshore Drilling Off Virginia's Coast, Costing The Commonwealth Thousands Of Jobs:
In 2007, The Bush Administration Authorized Expanded Offshore Drilling Off The Coast Of Virginia. "The Interior Department has put the final touches on a five-year plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore from Alaska and Virginia. Interior officials said Friday the plan will include more environmental buffer zones around lease areas and make other minor changes to a previous draft. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne is scheduled to announce the "major oil and gas development program" Monday, a department statement says. ... Interior's plan would, for the first time, allow drilling off Virginia's eastern shore, in a wedge-shaped area between the Maryland and North Carolina state lines stretching to a point about 200 miles east." ("Interior To Propose Expanding Offshore Drilling," The Associated Press, 4/27/07)
In 2010, The Obama Administration Upended Virginia's Plans To Be The First Atlantic Coast State To Permit Offshore Drilling. "The pursuit of oil and natural gas off Virginia's coast, gaining momentum two months ago, came to an abrupt halt Thursday as President Barack Obama clamped down on the offshore drilling industry. Obama said he will cancel lease sales planned off Virginia and in the western Gulf of Mexico, continue a ban on new deepwater oil drilling permits for six months, and delay a lease sale off Alaska. ... Canceling the Virginia lease sale upends Gov. Bob McDonnell's effort to make Virginia the first Atlantic coast state to permit offshore drilling." (Cory Nealon, "Va. Drilling Plans Dealt New Setback," Daily Press, 5/28/10)
The Following Year, The Obama Administration Excluded Virginia From Their Latest Five-Year Oil And Gas Drilling Plans. "The Obama administration's new five-year plan for offshore oil and gas drilling includes lease sales in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska but will not offer leases for drilling off Virginia or other parts of the eastern United States. The Interior Department's proposed plan delineates where oil and gas companies can bid, from 2012 to 2017, to lease offshore areas they think hold the promise of new oil and gas reserves." (Steven Mufson, "Offshore Drilling Plan Excludes Virginia," The Washington Post, 11/8/11)
According To A Business Group Estimate, Offshore Drilling Off Virginia's Coast Could Create Nearly 2,000 Jobs And Generate Nearly $20 Billion In Additional Government Revenue. "By going forward with offshore Atlantic oil and gas leasing and with Virginia participating in the development of offshore Atlantic resources, a recent report estimates that the state's activity could: Create approximately 1,900 new jobs in Virginia; Add $365 million annually to the Gross Domestic Product; and Generate almost $19.5 billion in government revenues at all levels of government (federal, state and local)."

Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell: "At A Moment When We Should Be Looking For Every Opportunity To Safely Produce More Domestic Energy, The Obama Administration Unilaterally Declared A Seven-Year Timeout." (Bob McDonnell, Op-Ed, "Virginia Could Be An Energy Power—If Washington Would Let It," The Wall Street Journal, 4/30/12)
Even Democrats - Including The President's Former DNC Chair - Called On The Obama Administration To Reconsider Its Drilling Plan For Virginia:
President Obama's Former DNC Chair Tim Kaine: "I Hope The Department Of Interior And The Obama Administration Will Recognize The Bipartisan Support For Developing Virginia's Offshore Energy Resources." "'I believe that clean, renewable energy will power our future. In the meantime, responsible domestic production can help create jobs, generate revenue, improve national security, and address our energy needs while clean energy technology is developed,' Kaine wrote. 'I hope the Department of Interior and the Obama administration will recognize the bipartisan support for developing Virginia's offshore energy resources and add Virginia to the current lease sale.'" ("Virginia Left Out Of Offshore Drilling," The Fredericksburg Free Lance Star, 11/8/11)
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, On President Obama's Decision: "This Is Disappointing ... I Will Be Urging The Administration To Take Another Look At Including Virginia In Its Five-Year Plan."  "Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., also said he hopes there'll be a change of heart. 'This is disappointing, because the safe, responsible development of offshore energy resources has broad support from Virginians and among the bipartisan elected leadership of the state,' Warner wrote. 'I will be strongly urging the administration to take another look at including Virginia in its five-year plan.'" ("Virginia Left Out Of Offshore Drilling," The Fredericksburg Free Lance Star, 11/8/11)
Democratic Senator Jim Webb, On Offshore Drilling In Virginia: "Would Boost Domestic Energy Production, While Benefiting The Commonwealth's Economy." "Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., said he hopes the administration will reconsider. 'Oil and gas exploration within the Virginia Outer Continental Shelf-if coupled with an equitable formula for sharing revenues between the state and federal governments-would boost domestic energy production, while benefiting the Commonwealth's economy,' Webb said in a press release. 'As we work to address our energy future here in Congress, it is important to note the administration's existing authority to include Virginia in the current five-year lease plan, and I once again urge the president to exercise that authority.'" ("Virginia Left Out Of Offshore Drilling," The Fredericksburg Free Lance Star, 11/8/11)
And President Obama's Energy Policies Have Also Harmed Drivers Across The Commonwealth And Virginia's Coal Industry:
Under President Obama, Virginia's Gas Prices Have More Than Doubled From $1.70 Per Gallon In January 2009 To $3.73 Per Gallon Today. (AAA Website, www.aaa.com, Accessed 5/2/12)
President Obama's EPA Regulations Will Force More Than 32 Of The Nation's Coal Fired Plants To Shut Down. "More than 32 mostly coal-fired power plants in a dozen states will be forced to shut down and an additional 36 might have to close because of new federal air pollution regulations, according to an Associated Press survey. Together, those plants -- some of the oldest and dirtiest in the country -- produce enough electricity for more than 22 million households, the AP survey found. But their demise probably won't cause homes to go dark." (Dina Cappiello, "AP Impact: EPA Rules Threaten Older Power Plants," The Associated Press, 12/19/11)
The Obama Administration's Regulations Have Caused American Electric Power Company To Close Down One Virginia Coal Plant And Shut Down A Unit Of Another By 2014. "About 500,000 tons of coal a year are burned at the Clinch River plant, an aging Appalachian Power Co. facility that has been producing electricity since Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House. The fate of this 53-year-old power plant, and others like it across the country, could soon be determined by new regulations proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ... American Electric Power Co., the parent company of Appalachian, says the rules would force it to shut one unit at the Clinch River plant and convert the remaining two to burn natural gas instead of coal. The second coal-burning facility that Appalachian runs in Southwest Virginia, the Glen Lyn plant in Giles County, would be shut down completely by 2014." (Laurence Hammack, "Power Or Poison? EPA Rules Could Limit Coal-Fueled Plants' Emissions," Roanoke Times, 10/9/11)


    The Closures Will Increase Electricity Rates From 10-15 Percent And Eliminate 80 Area Jobs. "The closures and conversions could mean a 10 percent to 15 percent increase in electricity rates, Appalachian has said -- adding another twist to the conflict between coal and clean air. ... About 80 power plant jobs would be lost to the regulations in the 9th District." (Laurence Hammack, "Power Or poison? EPA Rules Could Limit Coal-Fueled Plants' Emissions," Roanoke Times, 10/9/11)
  

Appalachian Power Has Claimed That Coal Regulations "Could Potentially Mean The Shuttering Of The Plants In Giles And Washington Counties And A Sharp Uptick In Customers' Bills." "Appalachian operates two coal-fired power plants in Virginia. Mallan said that the tailoring rule, as well as other proposed regulations, could negatively affect rates, permitting processes and company profits. He said some changes could potentially mean the shuttering of the plants in Giles and Washington counties and a sharp uptick in customers' bills."  (Annie Johnson, "Seeking Clarity On Pollution Rules," Blue Ridge Business Journal, 1/20/12)
