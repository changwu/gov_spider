New Hampshire will always have a special place in Hillary Clinton's heart.


  " To paraphrase your native son Daniel Webster, New Hampshire is a small state, but there are those who love it. And I am one of them. Going all the way back to 1992, you opened your homes and your hearts to us. In 2008 you lifted me up and gave me back my voice. You have taught me again and again the only direction that matters in life is forward."Hillary, February 5, 2016

Almost twenty-five years ago, she stopped by the New Hampshire State House to file paperwork to run for president—for her husband, Bill.

  " I filed my husband's candidacy papers in December of 1991, and there was nobody there. Like: ?Who is this guy from Arkansas? Who are you?' ?Well, I'm his wife, and I'm filing his papers.'"Hillary, November 10, 2015

In 2015, she went back to file her own papers.


A couple things had changed.




But at the end of the day, a lot of the things we're fighting for are exactly the same.


  " I'm running for president because I believe that America can't reach its full potential when you're held back from reaching yours. I want to break down all the barriers holding Americans back from achieving their dreams."Hillary, February 5, 2016
