    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 11, 2019) â€” Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer released the following statement following the Saddleridge Brush Fire emergency in the northern Los Angeles area:
"Today, our thoughts are with those families directly impacted by the devastating fires in southern California.
Moments like this serve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be, if we don't address the climate crisis immediately. Increasingly, we are seeing the growing threat of wildfires continue to put entire cities and communities at risk of being displaced or entirely wiped out. Climate change increases the chances and intensity of wildfires, making it more challenging to contain them with each passing year. We must act now.
Addressing climate change will be my number one priority as president, and my administration would declare the climate crisis a national emergency on day one and will use the emergency powers of the presidency to lessen the effects of climate change."
