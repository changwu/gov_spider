Ms. Mason, 21, was crowned Miss Indiana on November 4, 2007. She is a student at Ball State University and a strong advocate for ending school violence. She has traveled across the Hoosier State speaking to thousands of students about character building and respect, to ultimately work towards a brighter future for our schools and our communities.
"Hoosier families face a struggling economy with spiraling gas prices, stagnant wages and rising health care costs." said Mason. "We need a president who will stand up for us, fight for us and work with us everyday to tackle our toughest challenges.

I am confident that as President, Hillary will rebuild the middle class and restore the American promise."
