  ROMNEY MICHIGAN LEADERSHIP TEAM MEMBERS VOTED FOR LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN STATE HISTORY

Two Members Of Mitt Romney's Michigan Leadership Team Voted For Recent Sales And Income Tax Increases. "Among the very few Republicans who voted for the largest tax increases in Michigan's history this week: two endorsers of ex-MA Gov. Mitt Romney. They are: State Sen. Valde Garcia, a member of Romney's mid-Michigan leadership team, and State Sen. Ron Jelinek, a member of Romney's West Michigan leadership team …Michigan's 11.5 percent income tax hike and its sales tax extension will almost certainly be the subject of a question or two."
