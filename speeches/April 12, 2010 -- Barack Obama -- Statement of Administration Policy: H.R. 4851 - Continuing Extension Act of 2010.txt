(Senate)
(Rep. Levin, D-Michigan, and 4 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of legislation that is important for the economic security of American workers and their families. Accordingly, the Administration supports Senate passage of H.R. 4851, which will extend access to health care benefits for workers who have lost their jobs and extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are looking for work.
