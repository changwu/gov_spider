    My dear Mr. Secretary:
I HAVE warm pleasure in commending again to our countrymen the annual observance of Navy Day in accordance with the established custom of setting apart the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt for that purpose. I hope that on this day the American people will learn more about our Navy for it is through the moral support of our citizenry that the Navy derives its most vigorous incentive to strive for preparedness of our defense at sea.
We are at peace with all the world and for that we are thankful. We as a nation have no plans of conquest; we harbor no imperial designs. War will be avoided by all honorable means. To keep the peace is a fundamental policy of the United States; to live and let live in the spirit of the good neighbor is our earnest desire. I believe it entirely consistent with our continuing readiness to limit armaments, to maintain a defense at sea sufficient to insure the preservation of our democratic ideals and the maintenance of a righteous peace.
Happily recalling my earlier personal and official association with the Navy, I congratulate the Navy on its splendid efficiency, on its record of past achievement, and the competent leadership which directs it. I have full confidence that the Navy will maintain with honor the heritage of its worthy tradition.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable, The Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C.
