    
This has been her fight for decades.
Hillary Clinton's latest campaign video features footage from every stage of her careerâ€”and while she's worn many hats (and sported a wide range of hairstyles) over the past few decades, her mission has always been the same: improving the lives of kids and families.
1979

As first lady of Arkansas, Hillary served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, spearheading an effort to train pediatricians to work in poor rural areas and make emergency care available to children across the state.
1983

When she was appointed to the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, Hillary crossed the state, investigating public schools, listening to parents and teachers, and working with a team of educators to create policy that would better prepare Arkansas students for a 21st-century economy.
1992

As first lady, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now provides coverage to more than 8 million kids. And she helped pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which improved the foster care system and helped countless kids move from foster care to adoptive homes.
2000

As a U.S. senator, Hillary wrote legislation to recruit and retain high-quality educators, improve the safety of pediatric medication, and to promote quality education in developing countries.
And she's still fighting to give every child the chance to reach his or her full potential.
