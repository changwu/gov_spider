    Earlier today, President Biden announced new actions to combat COVID-19 as we head into the winter months and face the new Omicron variant. In remarks during a visit to the National Institutes of Health, the President highlighted key parts of the plan, including a nationwide booster campaign, launching hundreds of new family clinics to make it easier for parents and kids to get vaccinated together, and free at-home tests for Americans.
Health care organizations and providers, business organizations, and federal and state leaders applauded the President's actions to protect communities, slow the spread of COVID-19, and accelerate our path out of the pandemic.
See below for what they are saying:
Sterling Ransone, Jr., MD, President, American Academy of Family Physicians: "The American Academy of Family Physicians supports actions announced today by the White House to combat COVID-19. The Delta and Omicron variants pose a significant threat to the nation's health, and now is the time to take additional steps to prevent infection and prepare for surges during the winter months when viruses spread more rapidly." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
Gerald E. Harmon, MD, President, American Medical Association: "President Biden's plan will make our communities—and the world—safer in the face of an evolving pandemic and confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. The education and outreach program to seniors will save lives by encouraging widespread acceptance of booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines…Similarly, the expanded approach for vaccinating children five and older will help protect kids and allow schools to stay open. This, combined with making at-home testing more widely accessible, will ease the anxiety facing many working families. Physicians see a lot to like in this plan." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
Lee Savio Beers, MD, FAAP, President, American Academy of Pediatrics: "The White House actions announced today take important steps toward protecting children and families from COVID-19 and include a major development that will ensure families who rely on Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) can talk with their trusted primary care doctor about the vaccine for their children... The AAP applauds the Biden administration for taking this step and pediatricians are eager to continue doing the work to protect children and teens against this virus." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers: "In the wake of multiple COVID-19 variants, we have learned a great deal about the strategies that help keep our economy and our schools open, and the White House has put those lessons into practice: making testing affordable and accessible and using it more aggressively, ensuring vaccines and boosters are widely available, and bringing the entire education community—and the country—together in this effort." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
National Education Association: "@POTUS's decisive action today to support students, educators, and families in the fight against #COVID19 will help keep our schools safe and open for in-person instruction." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Neil Bradley, U.S. Chamber Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer: "We echo the sentiment expressed today by President Biden that no business should have to shut down this winter because of COVID-19. Vaccines are the most effective way to stop the spread of this deadly virus. We encourage employers to find ways to remove barriers to vaccination by providing workers with paid time off to get their first, second, or booster shot." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
Washington Governor Jay Inslee: "This is great news in the ongoing fight against COVID. I am grateful for our strong partnership with the federal government, and these FEMA Family Mobilization Clinics coming to King County is a great result of that partnership. This is an innovative model that will help increase equitable access to vaccination for all Washingtonians." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
Vermont Governor Phil Scott: "President Biden today outlined a strong plan to confront COVID-19 that will help the country keep moving forward. Like Vermont's current policies, it strongly prioritizes vaccines, boosters and testing. I share the President's commitment to progress by prioritizing what we know will work best, which are not the broad restrictions of 2020, because we need to be able to bring Americans and Vermonters along with us 20+ months into the pandemic." [Press Release, 12/2/21]
Senator Patty Murray (D-WA): "Expanding free, at-home, rapid COVID-19 tests is exactly what we've needed and is an important step towards keeping people safe from this virus and emerging variants like Omicron." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07): "This is a great step from @POTUS! Let's do everything we can to have a safe and healthy holiday season." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Representative Veronica Escobar (TX-16): "Boosters for adults and seniors; Vaccination sites for kids and families; Free at-home testing for Americans; Accelerating global vaccination efforts. These are just some of the ways @POTUS is fighting against COVID-19 and protecting our communities." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Representative Haley Stevens (MI-11): "I applaud today's announcement by the Biden Administration. I have been pushing for a federal expansion of our nation's testing capabilities. Testing is a critical element in defeating this pandemic and at-home testing should be free and readily accessible for all." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Representative Ruben Gallego (AZ-07): "We're still learning about the Omicron variant, but what we do know is the best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. As we head into winter, the @WhiteHouse is making it easier to get tested, get vaccinated, and stay healthy." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Representative Don Beyer (VA-08): "President Biden is unveiling a plan today to keep Americans safe and healthy without last year's awful winter that saw widespread school and business closures and 3,000-4,000 deaths per day at its peak. A far better strategy than Republicans' plan to let Covid rage unchecked." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
Representative Tom Suozzi (NY-03): "Incredible leadership from @POTUS. Every state, including New York must have a holiday plan ready. We must be ready for Omicron." [Tweet, 12/2/21]
