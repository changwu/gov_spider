    As required by Section 536(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act, the President is transmitting to the Congress a certification to release funds for aid to Nicaragua. The specific finding required by the law was that the Government of Nicaragua has "not cooperated with or harbors any international terrorist organization or is aiding, abetting or supporting acts of violence or terrorism in other countries."
The certification is based upon a careful consideration and evaluation of all the relevant evidence provided by the intelligence community and by our Embassies in the field. It also takes into account the Government of Nicaragua's repeated assurances that it is not involved with international terrorism or supporting violence or terrorism in other countries. Our intelligence agencies as well as our Embassies in Nicaragua and neighboring countries were fully consulted, and the diverse information and opinions from all sources were carefully weighed. The conclusion was that the available evidence permits the President to make the certification required by Section 536(g) of the Act.
This certification to the Congress permits the administration to proceed with disbursement of economic assistance urgently required to further U.S. national interests in this critical area. The administration does not intend to abandon the vital Central American region to Cuba and its radical Marxist allies. To the contrary, the assistance made available by the President's certification will enable us to give effective support to those moderate and democratic Nicaraguans who are struggling to preserve individual freedoms, political pluralism, the democratic process, and a strong, free enterprise participation in their economy. Sixty percent of the total $75 million in assistance will go to the private sector in Nicaragua.
