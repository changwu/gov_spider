    Dear Friends,
Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, when you can drop off your expired, unused, and unneeded prescription drugs at approved collection sites â€“ no questions asked. This year, I'm dropping off some old prescriptions because I don't need them, and disposing of them prevents these pills from being misused in the future. This can even save lives.
Prescription opioid pain medications are an important tool for managing the pain of people who have had surgery or other severe injuries, but the misuse of these medications and the use of heroin have taken a heartbreaking toll on too many Americans and their families while also straining law enforcement and treatment programs. More people now die from drug overdoses than in motor vehicle crashes.
You can help prevent opioid abuse by participating in Take Back Day. So tomorrow, head down to your local collection site between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. to drop off your expired, unused, and unneeded medications. And by doing so, you may just save a life.
Sincerely,
Richard BaumActing Director of National Drug Control Policy
