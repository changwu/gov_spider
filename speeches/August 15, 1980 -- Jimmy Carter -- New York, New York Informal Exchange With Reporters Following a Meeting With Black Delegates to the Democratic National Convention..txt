    Q. Mr. President, could you give us your impressions of the meeting?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it was an outstanding meeting. The fact is that the minority American—the blacks and the Spanish and others—have perhaps more at stake in this election than they've had in my lifetime, because the course of this country in the future—about equality and opportunity, the elimination of discrimination, the provision of jobs, the services for the old and the afflicted people—depend on who wins in November. And regardless of whether these delegates here supported Senator Kennedy or me—and they were fairly well divided—we are absolutely united in making sure the Democratic Party wins in the fall, because I think the future of this country, particularly for minority Americans and their rights, is at stake.
Q. Mr. President, do you have any reason to think that you won't get as much of the black vote this year than you did in 1976?
THE PRESIDENT. No. I think I'll get at ]east as much or more.
REPORTER. Thank you.
