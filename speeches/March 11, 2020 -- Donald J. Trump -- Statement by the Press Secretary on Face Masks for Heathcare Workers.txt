    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing his Cabinet to make general use face masks available to our healthcare workers. This is yet another decisive action to safeguard the health and safety of the American people, especially our Nation's dedicated healthcare providers, during the COVID-19 public health emergency. President Trump is focused on the health of the American people, and so his Administration has taken action to provide protection to manufacturers that will enable production of millions of additional masks for our healthcare providers.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services has already taken bold steps to incentivize the development of vaccines, therapeutics and other products and expand the availability of other needed products to address COVID-19 by issuing a declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act. Today's Food and Drug Administration letter on the March 2 Emergency Use Authorization will help make available millions of general use respirators to keep healthcare workers safe, mitigate further transmission of the disease, and address supply concerns.
In light of today's actions, we hope that Congress will consider amendments to the PREP Act and make these protections permanent.
