    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced it raised $1 million in the first 9 days of the fourth quarter. Cruz's impressive haul in just over a week comes off his successful third quarter fundraising, in which he pulled in more than $12 million. The early start in the fourth quarter brings his campaign's total to more than $27.5 million.
"It certainly shows what kind of incredible support and enthusiasm we have for our campaign," said campaign manager Jeff Roe. "But more than that, we have made the right investments in our fundraising infrastructure that ensures a sustained ability to raise the resources we need to be competitive in the early states and beyond."
In 9 days, Cruz raised $1 million from roughly 20,000 donations of mostly $50 or less. Cruz also recently revealed his campaign has more than 6000 "sustainers", donors who give monthly, that are able to fund his entire field operation across the country each month.
