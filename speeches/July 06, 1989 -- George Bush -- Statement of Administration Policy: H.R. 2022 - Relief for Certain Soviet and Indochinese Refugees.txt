    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Morrison (D) Connecticut and 93 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2022 because it would grant presumptive eligibility for refugee status to certain categories of persons and establish in law special nationality and sub-group preferences within the definition of refugee. H.R. 2022 would undermine the intent and effect of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to end the ideological and geographic preferences previously available to applicants for refugee status. Passage of the bill would also likely result in requests for similar treatment by other nationality groups.
