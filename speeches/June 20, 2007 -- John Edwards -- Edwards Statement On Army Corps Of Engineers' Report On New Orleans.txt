    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Following the Army Corps of Engineers' report on the vulnerability of large parts of New Orleans in the event of another significant hurricane, Senator John Edwards released the following statement.
"The people of New Orleans continue to be ill-served by the federal government -- first, when tens of thousands were left to fend for themselves after Katrina hit, and now again by President Bush and the Army Corps of Engineers. It's unacceptable that the Corps has not protected large parts of the city from the next major storm.
"We must to do everything necessary to ensure that New Orleans never suffers trauma on the scale of Katrina ever again. And, with all due respect to the Army Corps, we need an independent evaluation of the risk to the people of New Orleans and their property."
