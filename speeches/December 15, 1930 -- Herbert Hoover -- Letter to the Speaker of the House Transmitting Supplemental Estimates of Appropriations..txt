    Sir.
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress supplemental estimates of appropriations for the fiscal year 1931 for the Executive Office and certain departments and independent establishments amounting to $91,526,740.00.
A summary and the details of these estimates, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for their transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, which is transmitted herewith and with which I concur.
Nearly $80,000,000 of the expenditures under these appropriations were included in the estimates of expenditures during this year contained in the Budget for the fiscal year 1932. Less than two million represent new items and about ten million become necessary due to the change of wording of the emergency relief bill in respect to highways, the result of which is to impose this sum upon the regular budget and in effect increase emergency relief by that amount.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Speaker of the House of Representatives ]
