I have known Al for 25 years. Went to fights with him & Don King always got along well. He 'loved Trump!' He would ask me for favors often. Al is a con man a troublemaker always looking for a score. Just doing his thing. Must have intimidated Comcast/NBC. Hates Whites & Cops! https://t.co/ZwPZa0FWfNRetweets: 26491Favorites: 92734

Baltimore under the leadership of Elijah Cummings has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation. 25 years of all talk no action! So tired of listening to the same old Bull...Next Reverend Al will show up to complain & protest. Nothing will get done for the people in need. Sad!Retweets: 25885Favorites: 102980

If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left 'Squad' and King Elijah's Baltimore Fail it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!Retweets: 19285Favorites: 79808

Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say 'it's a personal favor to me.' Seldom but sometimes I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!Retweets: 26453Favorites: 110442

The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime and with very low inflation our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!Retweets: 14535Favorites: 60548

Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is Baltimore can be brought back maybe......Retweets: 30967Favorites: 143576

The Fed 'raised' way too early and way too much. Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. While our Country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering. We are competing with other.....Retweets: 15711Favorites: 74145

....countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That's actually why the E.U. was formed....and for China until now the U.S. has been 'easy pickens.' The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway!Retweets: 13853Favorites: 67617
