    "Rudy Giuliani is the only fiscal conservative in the race and it's easy to see why. John McCain not only voted with the Democrats against the Bush tax cuts twice, he's voted over 50 times for higher taxes. With a record like that, you can't tell if John McCain will stand up to the Democrats in Washington who want to raise taxes or stand with them." — Katie Levinson, Rudy Giuliani Communications Director
MCCAIN HAS VOTED FOR HIGHER TAXES MORE THAN 50 TIMES
Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA): "We Would Have Had A Much Bigger Tax Cut If It Was Not For John McCain." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "A Conservative Case Against McCain," National Review, article.nationalreview.com, 1/14/08, Accessed 1/18/08)
In His Twenty-Year Senate Career, John McCain Has Voted At Least Fifty-Two Times For Higher Taxes On The American People – That's More Than Twice A Year.*
McCain Was One Of Only Two Republican Senators To Vote Against President Bush's 2001 Tax Cuts And One Of Only Three Republican Senators To Vote Against President Bush's 2003 Tax Cuts. (H.R. 1836, Senate Vote #170, Conference Report Agreed To: 58-33: R 46-2, D 12-31, 5/26/01, McCain Voted Nay; Lori Nitschke and Wendy Boudreau, "Provisions Of The Tax Law," CQ Weekly, 6/9/01; H.R. 2, Senate Vote #179, Passed 51-49: R 48-3, D 3-45, I 0-1, 5/15/03, McCain Voted Nay; H.R. 2, Senate Vote #196, Conference Report Agreed To 51-50: R 48-3, D 2-46, I 0-1, With Vice President Cheney Casting A "Yea" Vote, 5/23/03, McCain Voted Nay)
And McCain Questioned The "Economic Premises" Of The Bush Tax Cuts. "Nor does McCain spare the rod in rejecting Bush's tax cuts, especially the $1.37 trillion blockbuster Bush pushed through Congress in 2001, criticizing its economic premises and its likely impact. At best, it's a long-term economic stimulus, not the immediate boost the economy needs, McCain said. 'All the predicates for the 2001 tax cuts and all the predictions for its results were absolutely, completely wrong,' he said. And it will worsen the deficit before it ever helps the economy, he added." (John Farmer, Op-Ed, "Maverick McCain Maintains A National Constituency," Newhouse News Service, 2/24/03)

  LIKE A DEMOCRAT, MCCAIN SAID THE BUSH TAX CUTS WERE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY

McCain: "I Want To See Tax Cuts, If They Are Necessary, Go To Working Americans, Not The Wealthiest." (Richard Ruelas, Op-Ed, "McCain Isn't Saying 'Oui' To Bush's Tax Cut Plan," The Arizona Republic, 4/25/03)
"And McCain's Stated Opposition To The Bush 2001 And 2003 Tax Cuts Was Largely Based On Socialist, Class-Warfare Rhetoric — Tax Cuts For The Rich, Not For The Middle Class. The Public Record Is Full Of These Statements. Today, He Recalls Only His Insistence On Accompanying Spending Cuts." (Mark R. Levin, "The Real McCain Record," National Review, 1/11/08)

  IN 2004, MCCAIN SAID HE WOULD NOT SUPPORT EXTENDING THE BUSH TAX CUTS

In 2004, McCain Said He Would Not Support Extending The Bush Tax Cuts. McCain: "I would have--I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate amount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit." (NBC's "Meet The Press," 4/11/04)
