    Over the past 5 years, we have followed an economic strategy of fiscal discipline coupled with smart investments in education, health care, and the environment. That strategy has eliminated the deficit and helped spur economic growth and the creation of more than 16 million new jobs. The House Republican budget is an unfortunate step backwards that would mean severe and unnecessary cuts in education, the environment, and health care. At a time when Washington is seeing its first surplus in almost 30 years and spending as a share of the economy is at its lowest level in a quarter century, this budget is not the right approach. As Congress readies its final budget, I urge Members to continue our strategy of fiscal discipline and strategic investments to prepare our country for the 21st century.
