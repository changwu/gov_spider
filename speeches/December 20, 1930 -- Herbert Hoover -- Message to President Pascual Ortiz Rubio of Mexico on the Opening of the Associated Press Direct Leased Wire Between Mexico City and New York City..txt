    Mr. President:
Mexico and the United States of America lie side by side on this great continent. They are neighbors and their territories adjoin each other, yet so extensive are these territories that their largest cities are separated by many thousands of miles and the citizens of Mexico City and the citizens of New York have little direct contact with each other. The occasion, therefore, of the opening of a direct leased press association wire between these cities is an event of very real interest to the cities and to the other sections of the two countries.
The message that I particularly wish to send to Your Excellency and to the people of Mexico today is the fervent hope that the means which are used in transmitting my message will be a great instrument of understanding and never one of misunderstanding.
I assure Your Excellency that the resources of the Government of the United States are devoted to this end, and I earnestly trust that the news which will flash back and forth over this wire will reflect an ever increasing sympathy between our two countries and will tell the story of many peaceful and happy and friendly events.
HERBERT HOOVER
