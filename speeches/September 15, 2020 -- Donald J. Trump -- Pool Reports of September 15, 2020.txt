 Intown Pool Report 8 — Details on singing ceremony table & chairs 
>From WH's Judd Deere...
Today's signing will take place at The Lee Dining Room Table from Blair House.
President Truman held weekly luncheon meetings with his cabinet at this dining room table. Discussions at this table helped to chart the progress of American diplomacy - fundamentals embodied in the Marshall Plan and Truman Doctrine were discussed at this table. The legacy of high-level meetings continues, as this table is now in the Lee Dining Room of the Blair House, the President's Guest House - where visits are exclusively reserved for meetings presided over by the guest chief of state or head of government. It has also served new and former First Families when they stay at Blair House for inaugurations and state funerals.
The chairs for the signing are from the current Cabinet Room in the White House.
