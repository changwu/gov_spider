(Senate)
(Sen. Enzi, R-WY, and 44 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 36, which would overturn recent commonsense measures adopted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to streamline and modernize workplace elections and ensure that workers deciding if they wish to be represented by a union have a fair vote in a reasonable amount of time. The Administration is committed to supporting the right of workers to join and participate in a union and bargain for fair wages, benefits and a safe workplace. These rights are fundamental to better conditions for American workers and to an open, just, economically fair and prosperous society. S.J. Res. 36 attacks these bedrock American values.
If the President is presented with a Resolution of Disapproval that would reverse these measures adopted by the NLRB, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the Resolution.
