    The President told Members of the Senate and House at Camp David this morning that he has received a personal commitment from Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia to increase substantially crude oil production for a significant and specific period of time. Details of production plans will be announced by the Saudi Government in the near future.
The personal message to the President made clear that the Saudi decision is based on their historic friendly relationship with the United States and their commitment to be a dependable supplier of oil to the world.
The President has expressed the appreciation of the American people for this decision. He wishes to emphasize, however, that while the increased production will be helpful in the short term, it does not relieve the United States or other oilconsuming nations of the necessity for firm action to reduce significantly their dependence on imported oil.
