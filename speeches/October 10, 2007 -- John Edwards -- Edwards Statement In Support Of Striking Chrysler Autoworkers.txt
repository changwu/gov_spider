    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement in support of the U.A.W. members on strike at Chrysler plants across the country:
"I stand with the 45,000 men and women of the U.A.W. who have taken action today. I know that they are walking the line for what workers across this country need and deserve – fair wages, health care for their families, job security, and a retirement with dignity including affordable health care coverage. I have walked picket lines with workers all across America who have led this same fight for our nation's working families. As a strong believer in collective bargaining, I sincerely hope that talks can continue in good faith so that these men and women can get back to work making great cars and supporting their families.
"These workers feel their backs are against the wall for good reason. Our government's trade policies have undercut their jobs and the standards they have worked for decades to create and uphold. While I believe that American workers can compete with workers anywhere in the world, our lack of a serious effort to help manufacturers denies American workers the chance to compete on a fair playing field and our lack of universal health care coverage forces workers to make huge sacrifices just to keep the coverage they have. America's workers are getting cut out of their share of the American Dream by a government increasingly controlled by corporate insiders from both parties. I am running for president because I want to end the game in Washington that is rigged against regular Americans."
