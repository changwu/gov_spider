The President. Well, if you want to believe them, go ahead.
Q. Are they telling the truth? Has the U.S. tried to bug the Soviet Embassy?
The President. I never discuss anything having to do with espionage or counterespionage.
Q. Well, what do you think of all their claims that they've made today and their so-called evidence that they've presented?
The President. I've been coming out here; I haven't paid any attention to it.
Q. Mr. President, are all these charges going to undermine Mr. Shultz' trip?
The President. No.
