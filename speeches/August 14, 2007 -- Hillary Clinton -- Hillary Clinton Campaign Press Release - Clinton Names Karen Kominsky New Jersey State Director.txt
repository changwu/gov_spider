    The Clinton Campaign announced today that Karen Kominsky, a senior New Jersey strategist who has served multiple governors and the Democratic Party in a variety of positions, will run its state operation.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change this country wants," Kominsky said. "I'm excited to get to work."
"I'm delighted that Karen has agreed to run my campaign in New Jersey," Clinton said. "She's a longtime public servant who is well regarded and respected throughout the Garden State. Her experience and integrity will be a great addition to my team."
Over the past 20 years, Kominsky has worked across New Jersey state government, most recently serving as Deputy Chief of Staff to Governors Richard Codey and James McGreevey. In that role she managed legislative affairs, helping pass landmark legislation such as automobile insurance reform, a stem cell research initiative and the Highlands Protection Act.
"Karen has a rich understanding of the issues facing New Jersey. She will be a tremendous leader in our effort to elect Senator Clinton our next president," said New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine.
Prior to her work in the Governor's office, Kominksy served as Deputy Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Her career also includes appointments as acting chair of the New Jersey Building Authority, board member of the Garden State Preservation Trust, member of the New Jersey Pollution Prevention Advisory Committee and member of the New Jersey State Planning Commission. Kominsky is currently a member of the New Jersey Real Estate Commission.
A licensed professional planner, she is a graduate of Douglass College and received her Masters of City and Regional Planning from the Bloustein School at Rutgers University.
Kominsky will join the Clinton Campaign after Labor Day.
