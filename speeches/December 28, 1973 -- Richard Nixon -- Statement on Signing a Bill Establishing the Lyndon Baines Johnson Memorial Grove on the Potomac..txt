    I AM pleased to sign House Joint Resolution 858 authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with the Committee for a Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac and the Society for a More Beautiful National Capital in developing a living memorial to President Lyndon Johnson.
This memorial will be in the form of a grove of trees located at Lady Bird Johnson Park.
Lyndon Johnson's long public career was devoted to providing a better life for his fellow man. His accomplishments were vibrant and vital and not capable of being conveyed through the hard and definitive constraints of marble or bronze. It is fitting that his memorial in the Nation's Capital should reflect this fact and that he should be remembered in a manner that reflects the concern he felt for the quality of the world in which we live.
It is especially appropriate that this memorial should complement the great work of Mrs. Johnson, who has done so much to make Americans more aware of their natural heritage. She shared with him the public tasks to which he set himself, and in this memorial, their achievements will be remembered together.
