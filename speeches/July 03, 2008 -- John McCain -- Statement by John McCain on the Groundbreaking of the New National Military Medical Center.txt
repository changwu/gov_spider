    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on the groundbreaking of the new National Military Medical Center at Bethesda:
"Today truly is a monumental day for those that have suffered in the service of this country -- the day we break ground for the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at Bethesda. As a co-author of the Wounded Warriors Act, I strongly endorsed an accelerated process to replace the aging Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a state of the art care facility that our soldiers deserve. It is sadly too rare that we see this kind of rapid response to meet the nation's needs.
"This is a great way to honor the sacrifice of wounded warriors, especially those of whom we have failed in the past. Due to its proximity to three world-class health care institutions -- the National Institutes of Health, the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences and the soon to be constructed National Intrepid Center of Excellence for post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury -- we will create unparalleled opportunities for excellence in military medical care, research and treatment for the 21st century. Also, as a joint services facility, it represents a revolutionary model for the future of joint operations among the military departments."
