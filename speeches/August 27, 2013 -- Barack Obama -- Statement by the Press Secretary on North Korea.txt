    Today the State Department announced that the President's Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, Ambassador Robert King, will be adding a stop in North Korea to his current travels in the region. We remain deeply concerned about the health and welfare of Kenneth Bae, the American citizen currently detained in North Korea. We urge the government of North Korea to grant special clemency to Mr. Bae immediately and allow him to return home with Ambassador King.
