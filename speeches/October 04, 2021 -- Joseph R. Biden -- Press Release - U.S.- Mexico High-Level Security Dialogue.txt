    The United States and Mexico remain committed partners on security cooperation to protect our citizens and to make our nations safer and stronger. On October 8, a U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State Blinken, will travel to Mexico City to take part in the first U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue (HLSD), in recognition of the enduring partnership, mutual respect, and respect for sovereignty that compels us to face security challenges together. Members of the delegation will also include Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols, and National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez. This Dialogue comes at a time when the threats of the 21st century become more complex, and know no borders. The Dialogue will build on discussions in previous months on protecting our people, preventing transborder crime, and pursuing criminal networks, while promoting human rights and the rule of law.
