The Iowa caucus is in just 10 days—and if you're anything like me, that makes you feel like:

There's A LOT to do in 10 days to bring home a win for Hillary Clinton, and she can't get there without us. The polls are tight, and this is anyone's game. We have the power to secure a win for Hillary on Caucus Day in Iowa if each and every one of us steps up to do one small thing.
Whether you live in Des Moines or Denver, you can help Hillary win in Iowa on February 1—and if you pitch in a few minutes of your time today, we'll be one step closer to securing Hillary's first victory.
Here's your first mission:
The most important thing any of us can do is make sure the people we know in Iowa are ready and committed to show up for the caucus on February 1.

From: You!
To: All your Iowa pals
