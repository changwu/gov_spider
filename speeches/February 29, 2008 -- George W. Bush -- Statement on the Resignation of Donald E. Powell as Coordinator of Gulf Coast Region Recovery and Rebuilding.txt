    Don Powell is an exceptional leader who has worked tirelessly and effectively to help the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region recover and rebuild from one of our Nation's most destructive natural disasters.
Don brought to the job of coordinating our Federal rebuilding efforts the perfect combination of talent, temperament, experience, and compassion. Today, due in part to his leadership and outstanding work with State and local leaders, the Gulf Coast is on the road to recovery. While challenges remain, the region is open for business, critical infrastructure is being rebuilt, and schools are up and running. People are reclaiming their lives, and our Nation owes Don a debt of gratitude. I appreciate his service to the country and thank him for his dedication.
I am also grateful to Paul Conway, Don's chief of staff, who will assume the duties of the Federal Coordinator for the Office of Gulf Coast Rebuilding in the interim.
Laura and I wish Don well as he returns to Texas.
