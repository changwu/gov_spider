The Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall and that I didn't think the Wall on the Southern Border was that important to stop Illegals wanting to come into our Country. WRONG vitally important. Will make a BIG impact. So bad!Retweets: 13977Favorites: 57312

There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent Fake or Corrupt! When the 'Age of Trump' is looked back on many years from now I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!Retweets: 35597Favorites: 145329

Crazy Lawrence O'Donnell who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency even being previously forced by NBC to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me & The Apprentice was again forced to apologize this time.....Retweets: 17705Favorites: 85795

....for the most ridiculous claim of all that Russia Russia Russia or Russian oligarchs co-signed loan documents for me a guarantee. Totally false as is virtually everything else he and much of the rest of the LameStream Media has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!Retweets: 16524Favorites: 81599

The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O'Donnell for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!Retweets: 23650Favorites: 97525

Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General's Report. He should be ashamed of himself!Retweets: 30889Favorites: 122300
