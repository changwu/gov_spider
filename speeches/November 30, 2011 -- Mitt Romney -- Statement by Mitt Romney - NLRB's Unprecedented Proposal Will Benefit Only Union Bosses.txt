    Mitt Romney made the following statement on the National Labor Relations Board's proposal for "quickie" elections:
"President Obama's out-of-control labor board continues to trample on the rights of workers, the interests of job creators, and the rule of law. The NLRB's unprecedented proposal to force employees into 'quickie' union elections will benefit only union bosses, while preventing employees from making an informed decision about unionization and preventing employers from challenging illegal union activity. Once again, America's businesses and workers are paying the price for a President who cares more about rewarding his political allies than about fostering an environment for economic growth and job creation. I have called for legislation that would guarantee workers and businesses at least one month to prepare for a unionization vote, and I applaud the Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives for passing the Workforce Democracy and Fairness Act to do just that."
