    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the deaths of Frank Madla, his mother-in-law, Mary Cruz, and his granddaughter, Aleena Jimenez. Frank was a dedicated public servant who devoted more than three decades of his life to serving his State and all its people in the Texas house and senate. Frank never hesitated to reach acrossparty lines to do what was best for his fellow Texans, and I was proud to work with him when I was Governor. Texas has lost a fine man. Laura and I pray for the full and speedy recovery of Frank's wife, Helen. We send our deepest sympathies to the entire family for their loss.
