    Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized that most Americans benefit directly from the healthier and more agreeable environment that results from our pollution control programs. I also noted that unfortunately these programs have been a factor that has contributed to a limited number of closures of already marginal industrial plants. Although there are a number of federal assistance programs available which can aid those who have lost their jobs and the communities in which they reside, the existing programs are not being widely used.
Therefore, I am directing you to take the following actions:
• Establish an Economic Assistance Program, including the designation of economic assistance officers at headquarters and in the field, whose purpose is to ensure that economic adjustment assistance is both understood by all eligible parties and made quickly available to those who qualify for it.
• Expand the Environmental Protection Agency's "Economic Dislocation Early Warning System" so that it includes more information .on potential disruptions to communities and groups of workers, as well as to businesses and so that it is operated in such a way that possible economic disruptions are identified as early as possible and that relevant agencies are quickly notified.
Please give these assignments your immediate attention.

Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized that most Americans benefit directly from the healthier and more agreeable environment that results from our pollution control programs. I also noted that these programs unfortunately have been a factor that has contributed to a limited number of plant closures. Although there are a number of federal assistance programs available that can help firms avoid closure, and, when it is unavoidable, aid both those who have lost their jobs and the communities in which they reside, the existing programs are not being widely used.
Therefore, I am directing each of you together with the Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Management and Budget to take the following actions:
• The Environmental Protection Agency shall have responsibility to inform affected parties of available assistance where it could ease adverse effects of pollution control laws, to notify the agencies offering such assistance of impending disruptions, and to work with both to encourage the effective, coordinated delivery of assistance; EPA shall report to me on June 30, 1980, and annually thereafter on the agencies' efforts to coordinate and improve the delivery of their economic assistance programs for this purpose.
• Each federal agency will cooperate closely with the Environmental Protection Agency and with other agencies to ensure that their various economic assistance programs are coordinated effectively.
• Each federal agency shall ensure that it responds effectively and expeditiously to specific adverse economic problems resulting from the implementation of pollution control laws.
• Each federal agency will recommend to me ways in which the existing assistance programs should be modified, if necessary, to enable the government to respond more effectively to economic adjustment problems that may occur in the future.
Please give these assignments your immediate attention.
