Travel Pool #2 - Limited cell service during bi-lats
We are currently holding at the RON awaiting President Biden's departure for the Kantei, the official residence of the prime minister.
Please note: The pool was informed that the bilateral meetings this afternoon (at 2:30 p.m. with Modi and 3:15 p.m. with Albanese) will be held in a part of the Kantei where there is no wireless service and very limited cell service. The pool has been told that it may be difficult to transmit during that portion of the day.
We were told that cell service will be much better for the Quad meetings earlier in the day. Your pooler will do his best to expedite all pool reports today.

Travel Pool #3
We are rolling from the Okura at 10:25 a.m. JST heading to the Kantei, the official residence of the prime minister, for meetings with the Quad Leaders. The pool did not see President Biden before we departed the hotel's garage.



May 24, 202210:38 JST

Travel Pool #4 - arrival
President Biden's motorcade arrived at the Kantei at 10:27 a.m. after a quick 2-minute ride. The streets were lined with onlookers bearing cameras and a number of news crews with video cameras.
We were rushed to a large, modernist ballroom for the start of the Quad meeting. We did not witness the arrival nor the family photo of the leaders despite being told that was the first stop.
The four leaders walked in at 10:34 am and the meeting is now beginning.



May 24, 202211:18 JST

Travel Pool #5 - Quad Meeting
The Quad meeting opened at 10:35 am.
The four leaders were seated at separate white tables with members of their staff seated behind them in a high-ceiling, modern wood-paneled ballroom.
President Biden is joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, USTR Amb. Katherine Tai, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Amb. Kurt Campbell.
Japanese Prime Minister Kishida opened the meeting by welcoming the participants and thanking new Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for coming to the meeting so soon after his election.
Mr. Kishida said it was important for the leaders to get together to make a "firm commitment" to "a free and open Indo-Pacific" and spoke about some of the topics of the meeting, including climate change countermeasures, maritime issues and technology.
Mr. Albanese said it was an honor that one of his first act as prime minister was to attend the Quad meetings
"We are committed to the Quad," he said, adding that Australia would be taking ambitious action on climate change, including a new target to reduce emissions by 43 percent by 2030.
Prime Minister Modi then spoke, congratulating Mr. Albanese on his victory and described his country's work on Covid-19 and other issues and praised the work of the Quad. "This is ensuring peace, prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific region," Mr. Modi said, saying the group was a "force for good."
Mr. Biden said the participants were gathering at "this transformative moment in the world - we are at a transformative moment." He thanked Prime Minister Kishida for hosting and said it was good to see Prime Minister Modi in person and thanked him "for your continued commitment to making sure democracies deliver." He joked with Prime Minister Albanese: "If you fall asleep while you're here, that's OK," noting that he had just been elected.
Mr. Biden then spoke about the importance of the Quad in responding to Covid-19, partnering on 5G supply chains and launching the Quad fellowship program. But much of his remarks focused on the war in Ukraine.
"At the same we are navigating a dark hour in our shared history," Mr. Biden said. "Russia's brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe. And innocent civilians are put into the streets and millions of refugees are internally displaced as well as exiled."
Mr. Biden continued:
"This is more than just a European issue. It's a global issue. The fact is that when you turn on the television and see what Russia's doing now, it appears to me that Putin is trying to extinguish a culture. He's not trying to hit military targets any more, he's taking out every school, every culture, every natural history museum."
"As long as Russia continues this war we are going to be partners and lead a global response," Mr. Biden said.
Pool and other media ushered out at 10:51 am.

Travel Pool #7 - Taiwan comments
At the end of an event on the Quad Fellowship, President Biden responded briefly to a few shouted questions on his comments yesterday about Taiwan:
Mr. Biden, standing alongside the three other leaders for a photo session, was asked if the policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan was dead. He responded, "No."
He was then asked to elaborate and said, "No."
Another reporter asked if Mr. Biden would send troops to Taiwan if China invaded.
Mr. Biden responded: "The policy has not changed at all. I stated that when I made my statement yesterday."
A separate pool report on the fellowship event is forthcoming.



May 24, 202213:09 JST

Travel Pool #8 - Quad Fellowship
The pool joined a large international media contingent inside a long, narrow corridor of the Kantei for the launch of the Quad Fellowship. Light wood paneling lines the room, which has roughly 30-feet-high ceilings. A tall piece of framed Japanese artwork graces one of the walls.
The four leaders arrived at 12:41 p.m.
President Biden stood alongside P.M.s Kishida, Modi and Albanese in front of a blue-and-white checkered backdrop that said: "Quad Fellowship by Schmidt Futures." They were flanked by their nations' four flags. The fellowship program is administered by the philanthropic organization founded by former Google chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt.
The event's attendees also included Eric Braverman, CEO of Schmidt Futures; Amb. Kazuyoshi Umemoto, president of Japan Foundation; and Professor Yoichiro Matsumoto, science and technology adviser to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan.
The leaders watched a launch video that included Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Braverman and then Mr. Kishida stood at a lectern and spoke about the fellowship program.
Mr. Kishida said they were hopeful their nations' students would "apply for this challenging but truly fascinating fellowship program."
"We conclude by wishing that this fellowship will become a bridge that connects our four nations," Mr. Kishida said.
The fellowship will sponsor 100 American, Australian, Indian, and Japanese students (25 per country) to receive scholarships to study in the United States annually for graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.
The first class will begin their studies in the fall of 2023.
The four leaders and Mr. Braverman then posed for photographs - and then Mr. Biden briefly answered a question about his Taiwan comments yesterday.
The event ended at 12:47 p.m.



May 24, 202215:17 JST

Travel Pool #9 - Modi
The pool was taken to Prime Minister Kishida's residence - a brick modernist home located a short walk from the main building at the Kantei.
President Biden's first meeting was with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.
The pool was ushered into a room at 2:35 p.m. Mr. Biden and Mr. Modi were seated at the end of a wood-paneled room near a soaring sand-colored brick fireplace. A small table with white and yellow flowers was placed between the two leaders. Their staff members were seated facing each other. The floor was covered with an emerald green carpeting.
Please check quotes against transcript - at times it was difficult to hear the speakers and translators.
Mr. Biden spoke first, noting that when he spoke to Mr. Modi during a virtual call in April, "you highlighted the need for democracies to deliver. I think that's what we're doing today. We're talking about how to deliver through the Quad and for the U.S.-Indian population as well. We're delivering for our people and for the wider world."
Mr. Biden noted that he announced the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Indo-Pacific Maritime Awareness program here in Tokyo. He also said he was pleased they had reached an agreement for U.S. Development Finance Corp. to continue to work in India on vaccine production and clean energy.
The president then spoke about Ukraine. "We'll also discuss the ongoing effects of Russia's .... unjustified invasion of Ukraine and the effect it has on the entire global war order. The U.S. and India will be continuing to consult closely on how to mitigate it."
Mr. Biden said there was so much the two countries could do together.
Mr. Modi offered praise for their participation in a "very positive and useful Quad summit." He said the two nations shared a "strategic partnership, in the true sense, a partnership of trust."
Mr. Modi said their "common interest in defense and other matters and our shared values have indeed strengthened this partnership of trust." He added that their "strong economic cooperation makes our partnerships even more meaningful."
He noted that the two countries' trade and investments are steadily on the rise and he expressed confidence that the U.S. and India will see progress in the investments between the two countries and in cooperation on technology.
He said the Quad and the IPEF are two examples of "cooperation and positive momentum."
"I am absolutely sure that the India-U.S. friendship will continue to be a force for good, for peace and stability, for sustainability of the planet."
After Mr. Modi wrapped up his statement, Mr. Biden did not respond to shouted questions about whether he would push Modi to take a tougher stance on Russia. The pool was escorted from the room at 1:46 p.m.

Travel Pool #10 - Albanese
The pool was brought into the same meeting room at 2:35 p.m. for President Biden's first bilateral meeting with new Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
Mr. Biden opened with a joke for Mr. Albanese. "I know you've been on the job a long time," Mr. Biden said, and then expressed appreciation for Mr. Albanese traveling to Tokyo for the Quad summit so soon after his election last weekend. Mr. Biden said it showed that Australia was "all-in" on the relationship and it was important for them to demonstrate, as democracies, that they can deliver for their people.
"I'm looking forward to getting to know you a bit on the personal," Mr. Biden said. "I was always kidded by Barack Obama when I would say, 'all politics is personal.'"
Mr. Biden said the U.S.-Australian alliance had long been an anchor in the Indo-Pacific and he expressed optimism for their alliance and offered his congratulations to Mr. Albanese.
Mr. Albanese said it had been an honor to start his role as prime minister with his meetings in Tokyo with members of the Quad. Then Mr. Albanese told a story about spending time in the United States.
He said that "many years ago, as a young fellow," when he was in his 20s, he was a guest of the U.S. State Department for a 5-week program to learn about the interaction of groups with the U.S. government.
Mr. Albanese said he spent time with an array of organizations, "everything from the National Rifle Association, to the Sierra Club, to Planned Parenthood to the full kit-and-caboodle."
"You're a brave man!" Mr. Biden exclaimed, standing up from his chair to shake hands with Mr. Albanese. The members of their staffs broke into laughter.
Mr. Albanese also drew laughs when he said the State Department "was good enough as well to manage to justify a trip to Vegas as well." He said it was a good trip for him.
Mr. Albanese then spoke about the durability of the two nation's alliance and was looking forward to strengthening it.
Mr. Albanese noted that he was part of the Australian government that brought the U.S. Marines to the northern Australian city of Darwin (beginning in 2012 during the Obama administration when Mr. Biden served as vice president).
"I remember that," Mr. Biden said.
He concluded his remarks by saying he looked forward to holding the Quad Leaders meeting next year in Australia and Mr. Biden invited him to visit him in Washington, "when you have the time, sooner than later."
The pool was ushered out at 3:27 p.m. Mr. Biden did not respond to a shouted question on North Korea. The bilateral meeting concluded at 4 p.m., according to the White House.
Here is the list of participants:
