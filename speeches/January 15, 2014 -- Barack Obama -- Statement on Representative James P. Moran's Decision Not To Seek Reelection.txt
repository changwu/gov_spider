    In his 23 years in the United States Congress, Jim Moran has pushed to create jobs and economic opportunity for hard-working Virginians and has consistently demonstrated a commitment to growing a strong American economy. And because of Jim's leadership, our brave servicemembers and veterans are better protected, our civil service is stronger, and our air and water are cleaner and safer. Michelle and I thank Congressman Moran for his service, and we wish him and his family the very best in the future.
