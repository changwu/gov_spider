    In a move designed to cut waste and promote efficiency in the Federal Government, the President today announced his intention to nominate Roger Johnson, chairman an CEO of Western Digital, to head the giant General Services Administration. The first Republican named to a top post in the new administration, Johnson served as an outspoken advocate for the Clinton-Gore ticket during the Presidential campaign, joining with other Orange County, CA, Republicans to endorse the Clinton-Gore plan to reinvest the Government and make it work for the American people.
"Roger Johnson's skills as a business leader and strong commitment to Government change will ensure that economy and efficiency are standard rule at the new GSA," said the President. "Partisan politics have no place at this crucial juncture of our history. We must all work together to get our Government back on track."
