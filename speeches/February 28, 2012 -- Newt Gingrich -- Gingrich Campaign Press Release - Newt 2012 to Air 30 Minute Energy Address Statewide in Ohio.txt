"Ohio families are hurting because of President Obama's destructive energy policies that block more American production while propping up money losing energy companies like Solyndra," said Joe DeSantis, Communications Director for Newt 2012. "Newt has a bold energy plan to bring gasoline prices down to $2.50 per gallon, create jobs and make America more secure. Newt is the only candidate in this race focused on bold solutions to meet America's challenges and the only candidate with the proven track record of actually getting things done in Washington."
More air times and locations in additional Super Tuesday states will be announced in the coming days. Newt 2012 previously announced air times in Spokane, WA; Tulsa, OK; and Nashville, TN; and Macon, GA.
