    Mitt Romney today released the following statement on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at the United Nations: Â 
"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at the United Nations today and his remarks earlier this week reminded the world why Iran's regime can never be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons capability. His threat to eliminate Israel and the disdain he expressed for the free world add to a long list of belligerent and disgusting statements. The United States must lead with resolve to ensure that the Iranian regime never obtains the means to realize its genocidal designs."
