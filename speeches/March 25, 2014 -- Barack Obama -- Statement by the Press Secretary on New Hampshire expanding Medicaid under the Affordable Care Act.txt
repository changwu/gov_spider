    Today's passage of Medicaid expansion by the New Hampshire House of Representatives marks a major step forward in ensuring that all Americans, including those in New Hampshire, have access to quality, affordable health care. New Hampshire's decision to expand Medicaid is about people, not politics. Expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act means that 26,000 residents who would otherwise be uninsured will finally have access to affordable coverage, and hospitals and businesses throughout New Hampshire will save on uncompensated care costs. New Hampshire is joining a growing number of states that have put politics aside to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and we look forward to seeing Governor Hassan sign this important legislation into law.
