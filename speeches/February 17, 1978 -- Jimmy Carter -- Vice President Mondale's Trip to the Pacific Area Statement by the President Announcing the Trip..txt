    Since my schedule will not permit me to travel to the Pacific area during 1978, I have asked Vice President Mondale to serve as my personal representative on a trip to this region in mid-April.
The Vice President will visit New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, in that order. His mission underscores the importance my administration attaches to this region of the world where we retain vital security interests and where we have very large and rapidly growing commercial ties.
The Vice President will discuss our security and economic relations with our ANZUS partners during his stops in Wellington and Canberra. His visits to Jakarta, Bangkok, and Manila will enable us to strengthen our links with the nations of ASEAN.
