    Mitt Romney made the following statement on the results of the Missouri caucuses:
"Ann and I thank the voters who took part in today's caucuses in Missouri. I am proud and honored to have earned the support received today. I'm running in Missouri, and I'm running in all fifty states, for a simple reason: I want Missouri to be a better place to live, work, and raise a family. What we have now is not the best that America can do â€” it's just the best this administration can do."
"It is unacceptable for 24 million Americans to be struggling to find work. I've spent my life turning around failing enterprises. There's no enterprise that needs more turning around right now than the federal government. Right now, under Barack Obama, the federal government is standing in the way of economic recovery. I have a plan to get it out of the way and get the economy growing. And that plan begins by earning every vote I can in order to send Barack Obama on his way. I thank all those in Missouri who are contributing to that critical cause."
