    IN GIVING its advice and consent to the ratification of the Consular Convention today, the Senate acted in the best tradition of American government. The impressive vote for ratification was the product, not only of strong bipartisan leadership, but also of responsible action by the membership.
The Convention will provide important measures to protect Americans traveling in the Soviet Union. Last year more than 18,000 of our citizens visited the U.S.S.R. These measures will become applicable as soon as the treaty enters into force.
I hope the Soviet Government will now move promptly to ratify the Convention and that arrangements will be made for its early entry into force.
