    Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum made the following statement in reaction to the Obama Administration blocking a new Texas voter identification law.
Rick Santorum said: "We need to show valid identification to do so much in our society, but for some reason, the President believes it is wrong to show an ID to ensure one-person, one vote. This is just another example of the misplaced priorities of the Obama Administration. This is not about voter disenfranchisement, it is about ensuring that our electoral system has integrity and voters are confident that their vote is counted accurately and fairly. I commend Governor Perry, Texas, and the many states like Texas that are fighting to ensure voter fraud does not impede the electoral process. As President I will stand with them and support their efforts for crucial electoral reforms."
