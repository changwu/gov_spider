    Today the American people honor those who were lost in the attack on the United Nations in Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan. Once again, we extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those who were killed and to the people of the nations that they came from. The desecration of any holy text, including the Koran, is an act of extreme intolerance and bigotry. However, to attack and kill innocent people in response is outrageous and an affront to human decency and dignity. No religion tolerates the slaughter and beheading of innocent people, and there is no justification for such a dishonorable and deplorable act. Now is a time to draw upon the common humanity that we share and that was so exemplified by the U.N. workers who lost their lives trying to help the people of Afghanistan.
