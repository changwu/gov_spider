"I previously endorsed Governor Romney, but since then Newt is the only candidate who has shown a willingness to meet and talk with Delaware voters for more than hour," said Hans Reigle. "Over the past few weeks I've listened to Newt discussing his vision for achieving $2.50 gasoline, balancing the budget, and shrinking the size of government and it is exactly the kind of positive agenda we need for Delaware and America. I'm proud to switch my support to Newt Gingrich and cast my vote for him next Tuesday."
"Hans is a dedicated Republican who understands the importance of local parties. I'm honored he has decided to join our team," said Newt Gingrich. "I look forward to working with Hans to share our positive message of job creation and lower gasoline prices across the state of Delaware ahead of Tuesday's primary."
Gingrich is campaigning in Delaware this week in advance of the state's April 24th primary.
