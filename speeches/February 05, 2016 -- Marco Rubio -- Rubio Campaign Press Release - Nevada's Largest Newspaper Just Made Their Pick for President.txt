Nevada's Las Vegas Review-Journal, the state's largest newspaper, has made their endorsement for the February 23rd caucus.
EDITORIAL: RJ editorial board endorses Marco Rubio for Nevada Republican caucus https://t.co/PcA0D2e9sS

One reason they're backing Marco: He understands the struggles of ordinary Americans.
Our reasons for endorsing Sen. Rubio are many. Notably, the Florida senator has deep personal connections to the state. He lived in the Las Vegas Valley from age 8 to age 14, the son of immigrants employed by the hotel industry. The driving force behind the 44-year-old's compelling story is his family's pursuit of better opportunities and a better life. The policies he champions in his campaign are intended to provide all Americans as much.

The paper endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican primaries.
They also cite Marco's ability to win in November and his strong conservative credentials.
Sen. Rubio is a limited-government conservative, as proved by his 94 percent conservative rating from Heritage Action — bested by only five Republicans in the entire Congress. He is not a go-along-to-get-along RINO (Republican in Name Only), as many have declared. If you want your next president to be an outsider, Sen. Rubio is part of the discussion.

Marco will unite the Republican Party and beat Hillary Clinton, and he will do it while standing up for his conservative record.
