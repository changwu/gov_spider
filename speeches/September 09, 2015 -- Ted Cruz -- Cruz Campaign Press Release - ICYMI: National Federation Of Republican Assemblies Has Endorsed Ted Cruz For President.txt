    HOUSTON, Texas â€” The National Federation of Republican Assemblies, a group that seeks to ensure that the Republican Party maintains its conservative values, has endorsed U.S. Senator Ted Cruz for President. Former Nevada Republican Senate candidate and President of NFRA Sharron Angle announced the endorsement:
"After a thoughtful deliberation and lengthy review of all the candidates, the NFRA membership endorsed Ted Cruz," Angle said. "The NFRA membership voted by an overwhelming two-thirds majority to endorse Ted Cruz."
She added, "We start early, we work hard. NFRA members vote in primaries! We bring critical thinking to the process of selecting a Presidential candidate. The NFRA members came from Nevada, Florida, Texas, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Alaska, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Arizona, Utah, Alabama, Rhode Island, Virginia, California, and others. They went home united for Cruz. We believe our early support will help Ted Cruz surge to a lead just as Santorum surged in 2012."
"I deeply appreciate the overwhelming support from NFRA and its members," said Cruz. "To correct the failures of eight years under President Obama, we need someone who will bring consistent conservative values to the White House. We need to restore the rule of law, follow the Constitution, and pursue those conservative principles that help grow our economy and create jobs. With the help of Sharron and the NFRA, I am confident we will be successful."
