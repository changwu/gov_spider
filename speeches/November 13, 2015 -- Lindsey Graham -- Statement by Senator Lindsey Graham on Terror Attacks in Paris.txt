    Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Senator Lindsey Graham made the following statement in response to reports of terror attacks in Paris, France:
"This is not just an attack on the French people, it is an attack on human decency and all things that we hold dear. My heart breaks for the families of those killed, the hostages, and the injured.
"There is a sickness in the world that has to be dealt with and the civilized world must come together to confront it. America should lead that unity."
