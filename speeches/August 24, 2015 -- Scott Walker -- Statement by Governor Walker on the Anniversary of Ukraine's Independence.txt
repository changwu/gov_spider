    Greenville, S.C. -- In recognition of the 24th anniversary of Ukraine's independence, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement.
"After 24 years of independence, I want to pledge unwavering support for an independent, sovereign and Democratic Ukraine. Unfortunately, after unchecked Russian aggression and a lack of leadership under the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, Ukraine's future remains unclear. Last week, Russian-backed separatists shelled civilians in eastern Ukraine, and rebel leaders declared they were preparing for a full-fledged war. As I said during the first debate earlier this month, America must provide Ukraine with the lethal military assistance needed to defend itself against Vladimir Putin's power grab in the region."
