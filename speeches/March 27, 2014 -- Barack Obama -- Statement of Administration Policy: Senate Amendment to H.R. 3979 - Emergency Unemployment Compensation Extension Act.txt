(Senate)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3979, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014. This bipartisan legislation would restore emergency unemployment insurance benefits that have expired for 2.2 million unemployed Americans actively looking for work and would continue important reemployment services to help connect them to jobs. Extending these benefits would not only help these families pay their bills but it is also one of the most cost effective ways to strengthen the economy, according to independent economists.
Historically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to make sure that unemployment insurance continues for job-seekers during times when there are still too many Americans out of work. The Congress should act immediately to pass this extension, restoring a vital economic lifeline for hardworking American families, while continuing to consider further extensions. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this and other measures to continue to grow our economy and create jobs, and to help Americans looking for work.
