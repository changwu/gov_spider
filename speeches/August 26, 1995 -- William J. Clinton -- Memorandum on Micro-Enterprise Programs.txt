    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury
Subject: Micro-Enterprise Programs
I hereby direct you to take all appropriate actions to coordinate all micro-enterprise programs administered by the Federal agencies and departments. This should be accomplished through an interagency coordinating body chaired by the Administrator of the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.
I also direct you to take the necessary steps for the establishment of a presidential awards program designed to honor outstanding microenterprise lenders, consistent with the mission of the CDFI Fund.
In discharging these responsibilities, you are directed to consult with the heads of other Executive departments and agencies as may be appropriate.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
