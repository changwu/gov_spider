    "[W]e're going in the wrong direction. This is a very difficult time for the American people and by the way, wages are also not rising. So, no increase in wages, declining wages, actually, declining number of people being able to find work, people dropping out of the workforce. It's another continuation of very bleak news on the employment front." – Mitt Romney

  MITT ROMNEY: "Well, obviously another disappointing monthly figure. I know the White House keeps saying that you can't look at just monthly numbers but if you look over the last several quarters, the last several years you see the continued pattern which is that we're not creating the jobs we need to create to put Americans back to work. For every net new job created about four people dropped out of the workforce. So we're going in the wrong direction. This is a very difficult time for the American people and by the way, wages are also not rising. So, no increase in wages, declining wages, actually, declining number of people being able to find work, people dropping out of the workforce. It's another continuation of very bleak news on the employment front."
