    Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce
Subject: Policy on Technology Transfers to the USSR
I direct that you, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and other appropriate officials, review and revise our policy with respect to the export of high technology and other strategic items to the Soviet Union. Pending review, no validated export licenses for shipment of goods or technical data to the Soviet Union are to be approved. This review is to reassess what exports will make a significant contribution to the military potential of the Soviet Union and therefore prove detrimental to the security of the United States in light of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
In addition, I direct that you immediately review those transactions for which validated licenses have already been issued but export has not occurred to determine whether any such licenses should be suspended or revoked in light of the changed national security circumstances.
Finally, I direct that you, in consultation with the Secretary of State and other appropriate officials, determine whether certain transactions now under general license requirements should be subject to validated license requirements.

Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Policy on Technology Transfers to the USSR
I have directed the Secretary of Commerce to review and revise our policy with respect to the export of high technology and other strategic items to the Soviet Union. This review is to reassess what exports will make a significant contribution to the military potential of the Soviet Union and therefore prove detrimental to the security of the United States in light of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
Our COCOM partners should be consulted on this review, which will reexamine precedents established in the past for COCOM exceptions, in order to secure their cooperation. These consultations should make clear that the basis for review and revision is the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan which has changed the nature of the potential danger to our common military security.
