    REPORTER. Mr. President, you have said tonight that these issues were complicated and difficult to discuss. Do you think that you did a good enough job of discussing Eastern Europe, or do you think you left some confusion?
THE PRESIDENT. I think I answered all the questions; I set forth our policies. And the final note, of course, is that we are at peace, and we are going to keep the peace.
Q. Mr. President, do you think that Mr. Carter responded to the first question or went and made an opening statement?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I thought he was very general, as I indicated. He covered a great many issues without talking about any answers. Therefore, I thought that he ought to be pinned down, and I thought the questioners made a big effort to do so. And we certainly hope--or I certainly hope that the American people will make certain in the future that he gives specific answers to specific questions.
Q. Who won the debate?
THE PRESIDENT. I think we did all right. We enjoyed it.
Q. How do you think you did in comparison to Carter?
THE PRESIDENT. I am not the best one to pass judgment on that. I felt comfortable, I answered the questions specifically, and I feel very good about tonight, just as I did about the first one. Thank you all very much.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
