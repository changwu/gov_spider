MITT ROMNEY: "Tomorrow, we get to work rebuilding our country, restoring our confidence and renewing our conviction, our confidence that we're on a solid path to steady improvement -- confidence that college grads four years from now will have better jobs waiting for them, confidence that single moms who are now working two jobs will be able to find a better job. Now tomorrow, on November 6th, we come together for a better future. And on November 7th, we'll get to work. Now, I'd like you to reach across the street to that neighbor with the other yard sign -- and we'll reach across the aisle here in Washington to people of good faith in the other party. It's much more than our moment. It's America's moment of renewal and purpose and optimism."
