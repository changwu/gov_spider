    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition Between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany, signed at Bonn on June 20, 1978.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the treaty.
The treaty is one of a series of modern extradition treaties being negotiated by the United States. It expands the list of extraditable offenses to include aircraft hijacking and narcotics offenses, as well as several other offenses not now covered by our existing Extradition Treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany. Upon entry into force, it will terminate and supersede the existing Extradition Treaty between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.
This treaty will make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
