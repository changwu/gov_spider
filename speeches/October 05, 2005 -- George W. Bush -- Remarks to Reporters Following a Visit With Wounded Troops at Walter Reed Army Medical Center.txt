    Once again, I had the honor of thanking the docs and nurses that provide such incredible care to our wounded soldiers. Every time I come here, I'm amazed by the courage and decency and strength of those who wear the Nation's uniform. It is such an honor to be the Commander in Chief of such fine men and women.
I ask for God's blessings on them and their families as they recover from their sacrifice and service.
Thank you all.
