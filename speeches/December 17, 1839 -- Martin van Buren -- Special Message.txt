    Hon. WM. R. KING,
President of the Senate.
SIR: I transmit herewith a report made to me by the Secretary of the Treasury, with accompanying documents, in regard to some difficulties which have occurred concerning the kind of papers deemed necessary to be provided by law for the use and protection of American vessels engaged in the whale fisheries, and would respectfully invite the consideration of Congress to some new legislation on a subject of so much interest and difficulty.
M. VAN BUREN.
(The same message was addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.)
