    The Clinton campaign announced today the endorsement of winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Latin Grammy, musician Willie ColÃ³n.
"Hillary has been on the side of our families for over 35 years - she has been with us from the very beginning. I want a President who I can count on, someone who in tough times will be there for me -- that's why I'm supporting Hillary Clinton," said ColÃ³n.
Willie ColÃ³n, a Bronx native of Puerto Rican grandparents, has fused his musical talent, his commitment and passion for humanity, and his activism into an extraordinary career.
His achievements in all his activities are widely recognized. As musician, composer, arranger, singer, and trombonist, as well as producer and director, ColÃ³n holds the all time record for sales in his genre -- he has created 40 productions that have sold more than thirty million records worldwide.
In 1997 Willie ColÃ³n became a spokesperson for the international relief and development organization CARE. ColÃ³n has also been involved in the campaigns to end the practice bombing of the Puerto Rican island municipality of Vieques. On April 16, 2001, Willie received the EPA's "Environmental Quality Award", the EPA's highest award for people that do not work for the Agency.
