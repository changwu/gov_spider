    Last September, I called on the United Nations Security Council to urge the cooperative action of all U.N. members against the illicit trafficking of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. I commend today's unanimous Security Council resolution, which answers that call.
It now remains for all member states to act on the measures urged by this resolution. Member states should enact strict export controls, criminalize the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and secure all related materials within their borders.
Today's resolution is an important achievement. We must continue to press these efforts to ensure that the world's most destructive weapons are kept from the world's most dangerous regimes and organizations.
