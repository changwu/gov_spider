    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related Protocol, signed at Washington on September 18, 1992. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The income tax Convention, the first between the two countries, is intended to reduce the distortions (double taxation or excessive taxation) that can arise when two countries tax the same income, thereby enabling United States firms to compete on a more equitable basis in Mexico and enhancing the attractiveness of the United States to Mexican investors. The Convention is generally based on the Model Treaty of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and recent income tax conventions of both parties.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and related Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
