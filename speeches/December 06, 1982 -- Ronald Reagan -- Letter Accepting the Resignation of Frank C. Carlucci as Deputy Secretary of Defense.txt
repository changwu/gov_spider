Dear Mr. President:
This is to inform you of my intention to resign as Deputy Secretary of Defense, effective December 31, 1982. This decision has been made for purely personal reasons. It has been a pleasure and an honor to work for you and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. I very much appreciate your strong support for our efforts to implement your policy of strengthening America's defenses. Your vision and your steadfastness have contributed greatly to the cause of peace.
You have an outstanding Secretary of Defense in Cap Weinberger. I hope you will continue to give him the kind of support you have provided in the past. If I can ever be of any assistance to you or your Administration, I would be delighted to do so.
Respectfully,
FRANK C. CARLUCCI
