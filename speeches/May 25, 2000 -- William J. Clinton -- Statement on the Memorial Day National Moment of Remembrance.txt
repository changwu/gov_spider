    I am very pleased by the House and Senate's joint action to offer formal support to the Memorial Day National Moment of Remembrance. The recently passed House Concurrent Resolution 302 and Senate Concurrent Resolution 100 have established the National Moment of Remembrance as an important part of this year's program to honor those Americans who died while defending our Nation and its values. Earlier this month I directed all executive departments and agencies to recognize and promote a National Moment of Remembrance on Memorial Day.
The National Moment of Remembrance asks each American to pause for one minute at 3 p.m. local time on Monday, May 29th to reflect and remember the sacrifices made by our fallen heroes. This simple, brief reflection asks little compared with what we have asked of our servicemen and women. With our united, solemn action, we honor and pay tribute to our Nation's heroes.
I wish to commend and thank Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and John Murtha and Senators Chuck Hagel and Bob Kerrey for cosponsoring these concurrent resolutions. Their leadership and initiative are visible examples of how we as Americans can work in unison to honor our cherished history. I ask all Americans to join with Congress in pausing to observe this National Moment of Remembrance.
