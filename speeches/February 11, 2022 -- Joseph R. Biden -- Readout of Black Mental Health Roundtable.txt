    Yesterday, as part of Black History Month celebrations, the White House hosted a virtual roundtable on Black mental health and wellness. White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice moderated a discussion with Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, Dr. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, from the Department of Health and Human Services; Golden Globe Award-winning actress and singer, Taraji P. Henson; professional tennis player and 2017 U.S. Open Champion Sloane Stephens; and WNBA MVP and Players' Association President, Nneka Ogwumike of the Los Angeles Sparks. Participants spoke about their own mental health challenges, the importance of seeking support and self-care, and their work to end stigma. The conversation also highlighted efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to prioritize mental health and diversify our nation's behavioral health workforce.
