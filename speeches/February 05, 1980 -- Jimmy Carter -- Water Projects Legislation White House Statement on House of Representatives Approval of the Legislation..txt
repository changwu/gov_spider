    The President is extremely disappointed that the House of Representatives today has voted to pass H.R. 4788, the Water Resources Development Act of 1979. This bill is a clear example of both unwise fiscal policy and unsound water policy.
Today's action by the House continues the long-established tradition of authorizing water projects that are unstudied, that benefit only special interests at the expense of the American taxpayer, and that move the Federal Government into an increasingly larger role in State and local decisionmaking.
The President recognizes that the country does have pressing water resources problems that must be addressed. The bill passed today contains some projects that are in the Nation's interest and that the President supports. Unfortunately, H.R. 4788 overwhelmingly obscures these projects by prematurely authorizing others that are still under study and by including a host of additional items that depart from established Federal policy.
The President asks the Senate to correct these problems by adopting a bill in accord with sound water policy.
