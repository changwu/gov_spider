    I welcome Congressman Ralph Hall to the Republican Party. Ralph is a close friend of the Bush family. He is a well-respected leader of the highest integrity and a tireless advocate for the people of Texas. We have worked closely together on the important challenges facing our Nation. I strongly support his re-election.
