    Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 20 Virginia state legislators and advocates who are fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive rights. The Vice President convened state legislators from across the country on July 8, 2022 at the White House; on July 14, 2022 in Orlando, Florida; on July 16, 2022 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; on July 18, 2022 in Atlantic City, New Jersey; and on July 21, 2022 in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Vice President thanked the leaders for their work defending women's reproductive rights and freedoms in Virginia. She spoke about how people do not need to abandon their faith to believe the government should not interfere in the ability of women to make decisions about their own bodies. She also expressed concerns about other rights that are in jeopardy, including the right to marry someone you love and the ability to access contraception. The Vice President shared actions the Administration is taking to defend abortion access, and she spoke about the importance of building a movement to protect reproductive rights. The participants spoke about the intersection between the maternal health crisis and the health care crisis that women are facing in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. They shared how more must be done to fight for the health, safety, and wellbeing of women, and they agreed to continue working together to defend reproductive health care in Virginia and across the nation.
