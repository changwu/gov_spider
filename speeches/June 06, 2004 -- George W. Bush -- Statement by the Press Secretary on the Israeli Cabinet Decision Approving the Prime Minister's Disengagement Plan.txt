    We welcome the Government of Israel's decision to approve Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement plan. As we have said, we view the Prime Minister's plan to withdraw all settlements in Gaza and certain settlements in the West Bank as a courageous and historic step. We urge that practical preparatory work to implement the plan now proceed as rapidly as possible in Israel. We also urge that the international community, working through the Quartet and with the governments of Egypt and Jordan, engage in rapid and continuing consultations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority to help prepare for these withdrawals and make them a successful step toward peace.
