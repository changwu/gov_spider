On a recent trip to New Hampshire, Hillary knew she could get a great cup of coffee at White Mountain Cafe in Gorham. What she didn't expect was that a five-minute stop would turn into an in-depth conversation about one of the most important issues of her campaign. What do you get when Hillary talks to people about their real problems and concerns? Real ideas.

It started when Hillary met a retired school nurse, who talked about the challenges she faced taking care of kids in the area—challenges that went beyond helping a sick child.
"I fed a lot of kids, I clothed a lot of kids. Putting Band-Aids on kids was just a little, teeny tiny part of my job. It was more making sure that they were ready to be there and learn. Because if they're hungry or tired or not supported, then they don't learn."

Hillary asked if there was anything the school could do to make it better, and a high school teacher chimed in with some ideas about the kind of support that will help teachers help their students get a world-class education—from creating support networks for educators to helping them stay up-to-date on new teaching methods.
"Really what we want is that collaboration."

One other important piece of the puzzle? All of that starts at the very beginning—just ask the early childhood educator who joined the conversation about what we can do in our kids' earliest years to prepare them for the future.
"We've got the research. It tells us early brain development is key."

Before long, everyone was taking part in the conversation. And everyone agreed: There is nothing more important than helping our kids get off to the best possible start in life—and giving them an opportunity to succeed. It's an issue that's helped shape Hillary's life and career. And before she had to go to her next event, she was able to answer one important question.
