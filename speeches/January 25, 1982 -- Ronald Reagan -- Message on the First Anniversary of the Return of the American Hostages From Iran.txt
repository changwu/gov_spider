    A year ago today fifty-two Americans returned home from Iran where they had been held hostage for fourteen months. We greeted them then with joy and thankfulness. We condemned their captors for demonstrating a cynical contempt for international law and for Iran's own lawâ€”and for undermining the fundamental commitment of all civilized nations to the settlement of disputes through peaceful means.
We will never forget the courage and strength of these fifty-two Americans and their families throughout the crisis. We are proud to commemorate today the safe return of these brave men and women.
