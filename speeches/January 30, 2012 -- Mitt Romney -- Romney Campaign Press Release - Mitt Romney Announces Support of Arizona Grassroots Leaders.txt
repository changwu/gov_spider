    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Arizona grassroots leaders.
"I'm extraordinary honored to have the support of so many Arizona conservatives," said Mitt Romney. "This shows my message of a 'Simpler, Smarter, and Smaller' federal government is resonating with voters all across the country. I look forward to working with these leaders to defeat President Obama and turn our country around."
Announcing her support, Statewide Grassroots Director Laura Knaperek said, "I'm very proud to endorse a true conservative like Mitt Romney. The three years of President Obama has brought nothing but higher unemployment, out of control spending, and a border that is as insecure as it has ever been. As president, Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth policies, repeal Obamacare, and secure our borders. For conservatives, the choice could not be clearer: We need a change. We need Mitt Romney."
