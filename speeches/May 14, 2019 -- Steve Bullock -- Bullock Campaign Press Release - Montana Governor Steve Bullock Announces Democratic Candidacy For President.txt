    HELENA, MT – Today, Montana Governor Steve Bullock announced his candidacy for President of the United States. A two-term governor who was re-elected the same year President Trump won Montana by 20 points, Bullock has successfully worked across the aisle to pass major progressive victories, including expanding Medicaid to ensure access to healthcare, protecting the environment, and some of the strongest dark money laws in the country.
"I believe in an America where every child has a fair shot to do better than their parents. But we all know that kind of opportunity no longer exists for most people; for far too many, it never has," said Governor Steve Bullock. "We need to defeat Donald Trump in 2020 and defeat the corrupt system that lets campaign money drown out the people's voice, so we can finally make good on the promise of a fair shot for everyone.
"This is the fight of our time. It's been the fight of my career. I'm running for President and with your help, we will take our democracy back."
