Today, the Donald J. Trump for President campaign is pleased to announce the expansion of its campaign team.

Nick Ayers will be volunteering with the campaign as the Senior Advisor to Governor Pence
Marty Obst will be serving as Manager of Vice Presidential Operations
Josh Pitcock will be serving as Policy Director
Marc Lotter will serve as Press Secretary
KellyAnne Conway will serve as an Advisor
Marc Short will be serving as Mike Pence's Communications Advisor

These Advisors will be tasked with organizing the day to day operations for Governor Pence, and interacting with the existing Trump Campaign team in an effort to take the campaign's message to the people.
"The campaign welcomes the addition of Governor Pence and his team of advisors to the ticket. Governor Pence is a man of impeccable character, and his addition to the ticket sends a powerful message to Hillary Clinton that America is not for sale," said Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. "We look forward to meeting with voters across this country and, together, we will Make America Great Again."
The campaign will continue to expand and build a superior political team as it works towards defeating Hillary Clinton in November.
