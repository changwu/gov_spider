    I AM deeply disturbed by the gunfiring into the Soviet Mission to the United Nations that took place last night. This is the latest of a series of uncivilized acts carried out by the extremist groups who are acting in a spirit totally contrary to the American tradition. The people of this Nation are repelled by terrorism and demand that it end. It is ironic that those responsible for endangering lives, threatening children, and harassing women claim to have a concern for human rights. Manifestly, they do not.
I have instructed the Department of Justice to do everything it can in cooperation with the New York authorities to bring to justice those who have committed these vicious acts. I am confident that the New York authorities will cooperate in these efforts to the fullest degree.
