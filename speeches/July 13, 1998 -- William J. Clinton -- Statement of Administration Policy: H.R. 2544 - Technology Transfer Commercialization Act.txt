    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Morella (R) Maryland and 5 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2544. The bill will significantly facilitate the licensing of Government-owned inventions by Federal agencies. The modifications that were made by the Science Committee to section 6 of the bill are important to the Administration's support of the bill. These modifications should ensure that the requirements of that provision will not unduly hamper the process of entering into cooperative research and development agreements.
