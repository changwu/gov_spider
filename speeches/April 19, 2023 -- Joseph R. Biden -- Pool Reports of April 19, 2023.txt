WH pool report 1 -- checking in, overview of the day
Bonjour on a tres magnifique morning at the White House, where the view outside your pooler's window is bright green leaves and a deep blue sky.
The only public item on the schedule at this point is the president's visit to Accokeek, Maryland, where he is to speak about the economy at a union training center at 1430.
Those needing fresh "MAGA Republican" quotes for their debt ceiling stories should probably tune in. The event is open press (but pooled for TV) and will be streamed from the WH web site.
Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's briefing is set for 1215.

WH pool report 7 — arrival in Accokeek
The two-dozen vehicle strong motorcade, not counting motorcycles, arrived at the site of the president's speech at 1419 following an uneventful drive across the National Mall, across the Anacostia River, and then south on State Road 210 roughly parallel to the Potomac, and through a residential neighborhood where people stood with their phones videoing.

WH pool report 8 -- color from the room, 2 min warning
The president will be speaking in a corrugated steel garage/workshop, part of a cinderblock structure housing the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 77.
The small podium and a lectern with the presidential seal were positioned beneath the overhead beams of a large crane, with several dozen folding chairs arranged on the smooth cement floor. These are filled with attendees.
A media riser is directly across from the podium, on which are two large video monitors that are likely the output for his teleprompter.

WH pool report 10 -- Biden remarks over
The president wrapped up his remarks at 1521, after speaking for 41 minutes.
Biden spoke about the economy as he has since the start of his campaign:
"Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America. And unions built the middle class."
"Folks, trickle-down economics doesn't work."
He also praised the infrastructure law that was passed with his backing, pointing how many construction jobs would be created.
"We have announced over 25,000 infrastructure so far."
He also repeated, again, his warning that "MAGA Republicans" are threatening to default on sovereign debt payments in order to get their way on budget cuts, pointing to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's speech on Wall Street Monday warning of a possible default on the debt.
"Massive cuts in programs you count on."
"We've never ever defaulted on a debt. It would destroy the economy."
"America is not a dead-beat nation."
"Take default off the table."
He told McCarthy to pass a debt ceiling without tying it to "wacko" demands from his caucus.
"If he fails, the American people would be devastated."
Biden also credited his "Inflation Reduction Act" for bringing down the price of insulin to no more than $35 a month, making the "biggest investment" in climate change reduction in history, and also bringing down inflation.
"Inflation has been coming down, nine months in a row."
He said his work to combat climb is not merely theoretical, and cited the natural disasters he has visited in his time in office.
"And anyone who doesn't believe in global warming? Hang out with me, man."
Biden went back to McCarthy and Republicans' hopes to slash discretionary spending, criticizing them for attacking the FBI.
"MAGA Republicans in Congress want to defund the FBI, the police."
"They don't like the FBI. Maybe it arrested some of them."
