    To the Congress of the United States:
I have reviewed the activities of United States Government departments and agencies during the calendar year 1984 related to preventing nuclear proliferation, and I am pleased to submit my annual report on this subject pursuant to section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-242).
The Report concludes that the United States during 1984 continued to make important progress in its efforts to achieve its non-proliferation goals.
It is my firm conviction that preventing the spread of nuclear explosives to additional countries is essential to world peace and stability. It forms an indispensable complement to the efforts we have undertaken to bring about deep reductions in strategic and intermediate-range nuclear weapons. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of mankind may well depend on the achievement of these goals, and I intend to pursue them with unflagging determination and a deep sense of personal commitment.
