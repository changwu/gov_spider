    Today's study released by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence confirms what we have known all along: that the Brady law is helping to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. The study also gives us more good news about the Brady law—that it has worked to help disrupt illegal gun trafficking patterns, making it more difficult for gun traffickers to do business.
While States are no longer required to conduct Brady background checks in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision, I am pleased that State and local law enforcement agencies around the country are overwhelmingly continuing to do these checks on a voluntary basis. Our goal remains unchanged: no background check, no handgun purchase.
I have pledged to do everything in my power to make sure that we continue to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals—including extending Brady background checks to violent juveniles who should not be able to buy a gun on their 21st birthday. Today's study further makes the case that for the safety of our communities and of all Americans, Brady background checks must continue.
