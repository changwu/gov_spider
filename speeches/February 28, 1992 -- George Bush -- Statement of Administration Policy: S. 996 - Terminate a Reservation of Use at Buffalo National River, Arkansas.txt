    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bumpers (D) Arkansas)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 996 because the bill provides inequitable private relief to Mr. and Mrs. Hedges, the former owners of property at Buffalo National River in Arkansas.
The Hedges sold their home and property in 1979 to the National Park Service (NPS) for $475,000 on the condition that they could have a "reservation of use and occupancy" for 25 years. The reservation's value, for both land and improvements, was $19,149. The home was destroyed by fire in 1991 and, rather than rebuild, the Hedges are seeking a refund for the unused portion of the reservation for both the home and the property.
The NPS has formally offered to acquire the value of the Hedges' unused portion of the reservation for the land only. That offer still stands. However, due to the unfortunate loss of the residence, all of the Federal Government's equity in the house and the related portion of the original reservation has no remaining value. Taxpayers should not be required to purchase something that no longer exists.
