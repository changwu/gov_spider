    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' stand against the proposed Bakken oil pipeline in Iowa is the focus of a new television ad set to begin airing on Wednesday in Iowa. Sanders is the only candidate to oppose the pipeline, which would pump dirty crude oil across Iowa.
In the 30-second ad, two Iowa farmers explain that they support Sanders because "he stands up against the pipeline."
"Bernie Sanders didn't hesitate to say no to the big oil companies," George Naylor of Churdan, Iowa, says. "Bernie knows that if we don't act we threaten the climate and the health of our children," Patti Edwardson adds. "Bernie Sanders has the guts to just stand up for what he believes in," Edwardson concludes.
Sanders first voiced his opposition to the pipeline, which would transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily through 18 Iowa counties, in November. Sanders noted at the time that he was "opposed to the construction of the Bakken crude oil pipeline because as a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels, and not increase our dependence on oil, coal and other carbon pollution sources."
Sanders was also the first candidate to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline and the Northeast Energy Direct pipeline in New Hampshire. He has pledged to accelerate the transition to clean energy as president by ending all new federal leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and waters.
