    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with President Xi Jinping of China. The leaders affirmed that the recent adoption of a new United Nations Security Council resolution regarding North Korea was an important and necessary step toward achieving peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior. The Presidents also reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. President Trump looks forward to seeing President Xi in China later this year, a meeting that will be a very historic event. The relationship between the two Presidents is an extremely close one, and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem.
