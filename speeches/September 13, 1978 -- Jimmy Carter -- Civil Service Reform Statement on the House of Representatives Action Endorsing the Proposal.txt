    The overwhelming endorsement in the House of Representatives today of my civil service reform proposal is a victory for every citizen concerned about government waste and inefficiency. The House's action, together with the Senate's favorable vote last month, demonstrates clearly that the administration and Congress together can take the tough steps needed to make the Federal Government effective and competent.
The House's commitment to civil service reform deserves the appreciation of every American. I want to commend Speaker O'Neill, Chairman Nix, and Congressman Derwinski for their dedicated efforts, and to especially thank Congressman Udall for his invaluable help on this measure.
I urge the Senate-House Conference Committee on the civil service bill to act promptly, so that we can begin to implement these reforms as soon as possible.
