    "With the resignation of Don Powell, the President should take this opportunity to redouble the federal government's efforts to rebuild the Gulf Coast. Mr. Powell never had the tools or the support from the President for the type of rebuilding New Orleans and the region so badly needed -- and still need.
"The President should appoint a new coordinator who reports directly to the President. The coordinator must be given the authority to cut through the needless red-tape and bureaucracy that to this day stands in the way of meaningful recovery. Because rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast is not a New Orleans obligation or a Louisiana obligation, it's an American obligation.
"As President, I will make the rebuilding and recovery of the city of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast a top priority of my Administration. I will appoint a Gulf Coast Recovery Director who will serve in the West Wing and report regularly to me on the region's progress. I will be accountable for making real progress towards restoring the Gulf. As President, I will work every day to get the job done."
