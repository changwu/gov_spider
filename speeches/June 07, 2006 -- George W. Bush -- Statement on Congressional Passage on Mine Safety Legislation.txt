    I am pleased that the Congress has acted in a bipartisan way to pass important mine safety legislation. This legislation will complement the Mine Safety and Health Administration's efforts to enhance mine safety training, improve safety and communications technology, and provide emergency caches of breathable air for miners. The bill also increases penalties for those who violate mine safety laws. America's miners and their families can be confident that their Government is committed to taking measures that will help prevent accidents and save lives. I look forward to signing this bill into law.
