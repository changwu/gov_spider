Bedford, IA - This evening, the Rick Santorum for President Campaign received the endorsements of two major Granite State conservative leaders - Shannon McGinley and State Senator Jim Luther.
Rick Santorum said: "As the First-in-the-Nation primary draws closer, it is becoming clearer and clearer that our vision for a brighter America based on our Founders' vision of faith, family and freedom is gaining more and more momentum. I am honored to have Shannon and Jim on our team, as we make greater and greater strides all across New Hampshire, and work to earn the vote of Granite State voters. With their help, we will do what we did in Iowa, defy the pundits and the odds on election day."
Shannon McGinley has been interested and involved in politics her entire adult life. She is a founding board member and current Chairman of Cornerstone Policy Research and Cornerstone Action: two non-partisan, non-profit, research, education and lobbying organizations dedicated to the preservation of strong families, limited government and free markets. Since moving to New Hampshire to raise her family in 1997, she has worked as a volunteer on countless campaigns and serves as a board member to the Bedford Republican Committee and voting member of the Hillsborough County Republican Committee. She has also been elected to serve as delegate to the NH State Republican Committee Convention for the past two election cycles.
State Senator Jim Luther has been a leader in New Hampshire for economic growth and limited government. A small business owner, Luther has focused his work on reducing unemployment, improving access to capital, balancing the state budget with limited government and lower taxes. Throughout his career, Luther has worked in large companies and non-profits alike, such as Digital Equipment, Wang Labs and NEBS.
