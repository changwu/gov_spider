    Jackson Lee will serve as Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and named her a National Campaign Co-Chair and Gulf States Regional Co-Chair.
"I am pleased today to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton for President," Jackson Lee said. "Senator Clinton has a great love for America and has a deep understanding of the issues that face our nation. I look forward to having a strategic role in the campaign and helping this dedicated public servant become the next President of the United States."
Jackson Lee is in her seventh term in Congress, and is Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus and a leading voice on immigration issues. Congressional Quarterly has named her one of the 50 most effective Members of Congress, and U.S. News and World Report called her one of the 10 most influential legislators in the House of Representatives.
Jackson Lee brings extensive experience on the issue of immigration reform, having served as the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, Jackson Lee has considerable expertise in homeland, border, and national security issues. Additionally, as founder and Co-chair of the Children's Caucus, Jackson Lee will bring a wide range of fresh ideas to the campaign as it focuses on our nation's children.
Prior to her election to Congress, Jackson Lee served two terms on the Houston City Council and before that was an Associate Municipal Court Judge in Houston.
"Sheila is a highly respected leader on children and family issues and the needs of this nation," Clinton said. "I'm delighted that she will help lead our efforts nationally and expand our outreach across the United States."
