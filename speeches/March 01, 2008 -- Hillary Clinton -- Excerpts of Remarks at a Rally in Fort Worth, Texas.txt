    Below are excerpts of Hillary Clinton's prepared remarks for this afternoon's "Solutions for America" rally in Fort Worth, Texas:
...My opponent and I are in an important debate about national security - and which one of us is best prepared to take charge as Commander-in-Chief.
He calls that fear-mongering.
Well, I don't think Texans scare that easy.
We know we have a job to do - to end the war in Iraq and win the war in Afghanistan.
When my opponent says it's fear-mongering to talk about who is ready to protect America, I say: If you can't have that debate with me, how can you have it with John McCain?
We are running for the most important job in the world, and you can't run away from a debate on national security. - - -
"My opponent talks about a speech he gave on Iraq in 2002. Well, there's a big difference between giving a speech at an anti-war rally and giving orders as commander-in-chief. When a crisis comes and that phone rings at 3 a.m. in the White House, you don't have time for speeches. You don't have time for on-the-job training.
He talks about these issues, but then he goes missing in action.
He gave his speech about Iraq when he was running for the Senate, but two years later he said he agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war.
He's running an ad that touts his position on Afghanistan. He chairs a subcommittee on NATO, which is a major ally in the war in Afghanistan. But he failed to hold a single substantive hearing on Afghanistan or anything else.
He even went missing on an important vote on Iran.
