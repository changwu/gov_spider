THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION (ARMY) FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
TO
COMPANY A, 1ST BATTALION, 35TH INFANTRY UNITED STATES ARMY
for distinguishing itself by outstanding performance of duty and exceptional valor in action against a numerically superior and heavily armed North Vietnamese Army force in Pleiku Province, Republic of Vietnam, on 28-29 May 1966. During the afternoon of 28 May 1966, Company A was directed to move to the assistance of Company B, 2d Battalion, 35th Infantry, which was heavily engaged by a determined and well equipped enemy. Moving by helicopter lift, Company A arrived in the battle area by 1700 hours and joined the beleaguered unit. During the next 20 hours the enemy attacked in multi-battalion strength with uncommon determination and intensity of effort. Outnumbered and surrounded, Company A fought valiantly, shoulder to shoulder, with Company B as successive waves of the foe sought to overrun their position. With great professional skill, the officers and men of Company A repelled each enemy onslaught. Gallant acts by all men and inspired leadership were the order of the day. When the roar of battle subsided, the enemy had withdrawn to reorganize his battered units, leaving 241 of his troops dead and numerous weapons as mute evidence of the intensity of the engagement and the valiant efforts of the defenders. Through their heroic stand, another illustrious page was written in United States military annals, honoring forever the men of Company A, 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, and providing a strong source of inspiration for all personnel within the United States Army.
