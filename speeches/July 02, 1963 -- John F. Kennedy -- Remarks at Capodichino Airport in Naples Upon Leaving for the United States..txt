    Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Foreign Minister, Mr. Defense Minister, Ambassador:
On behalf of all the Americans who came on this journey into Europe this summer, I want to express our warmest thanks to you and particularly to the people of Naples who made us sorry to go and happy to come back. This has been a short visit to this great country. But I go now to my own people from whom I carried messages of good will to all of you, and I carry home to them a strong feeling that the efforts that they have made over the last 18 years are understood, are recognized, and that a great flood of friendship, particularly in this country, wells forward for all of my countrymen and for all that we are trying to do, all that we hope to be. And most of all, Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to you and your Government for all that you did to make this very short stay most productive.
Grazie.
