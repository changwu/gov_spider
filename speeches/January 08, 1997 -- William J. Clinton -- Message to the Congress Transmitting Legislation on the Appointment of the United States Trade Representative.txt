    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith for your immediate consideration and enactment legislation to provide a waiver from certain provisions relating to the appointment of the United States Trade Representative.
This draft bill would authorize the President, acting by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint Charlene Barshefsky as the United States Trade Representative, notwithstanding any limitations imposed by certain provisions of law. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 amended the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 regarding the appointment of the United States Trade Representative and the Deputy United States Trade Representatives by imposing certain limitations on their appointment. These limitations only became effective with respect to the appointment of the United States Trade Representative and Deputy United States Trade Representatives on January 1, 1996, and do not apply to individuals who were serving in one of those positions on that date and continue to serve in them. Because Charlene Barshefsky was appointed Deputy United States Trade Representative on May 28, 1993, and has continued to serve in that position since then, the limitations in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which became effective on January 1, 1996, do not apply to her in her capacity as Deputy United States Trade Representative and it is appropriate that they not apply to her if she is appointed to be the United States Trade Representative.
I have today nominated Charlene Barshefsky to be the next United States Trade Representative. She has done an outstanding job as Deputy United States Trade Representative since 1993 and as Acting United States Trade Representative for the last 9 months. I am confident she will make an excellent United States Trade Representative. I urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this legislation.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, January 8, 1997.
