    I send greetings to Muslims celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the Festival of Breaking the Fast.
This festival marks the end of the month-long fast of Ramadan, the holiest period of the Islamic year. Eid al-Fitr is a time to give thanks to God for the blessings of renewed faith, to perform acts of charity, and to share traditional food and good wishes with family and friends. Islam is a religion that inspires its followers to lead lives based on justice, compassion, and personal responsibility.
During this joyful season, I encourage people of all faiths to reflect on our shared values: love of family, gratitude to God, a commitment to religious freedom, and respect for the diversity that adds to our Nation's strength. By working together to advance peace and mutual understanding, we help build a future of promise and compassion for all.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous celebration. Eid mubarek.
