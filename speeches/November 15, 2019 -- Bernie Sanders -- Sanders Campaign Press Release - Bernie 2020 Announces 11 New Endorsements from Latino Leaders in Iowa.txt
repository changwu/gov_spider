DES MOINES -- Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Friday announced 11 new endorsements from Latino workers, activists and small business owners across Iowa. The endorsers include a DACA recipient, who has issued their support for Sen. Sanders as the U.S. Supreme Court deliberates on the fate of Dreamers and the DACA program.
"Across this state, Latino Iowans are standing up and fighting for justice," said Bernie 2020 Iowa Co-Chair Nick Salazar. "Bernie has the most progressive immigration policy in presidential history. Bernie knows where he came from, standing up for immigrant families like his. Bernie will always fight for our health care, our families and our fellow workers because our fight is his fight."
