    I met with the Reverend Benjamin Hooks today to personally express to him my outrage at the recent bombings, obscene phone calls, and hate mail that have threatened the NAACP headquarters and branch chapters around the country over the past weeks. I have also reassured him that my administration will not tolerate bigotry and racial prejudice. We must finally leave the tired old baggage of bigotry and racial hatred behind us. I have asked Reverend Hooks to let his membership know that this administration will not let up in the fight against racism and that we will work to bring the perpetrators of these hideous crimes to justice.
It is particularly appropriate at this time, as we celebrate Dr. King's birthday in this first month of the new decade, that we restate our dedication to fulfill the dream of opportunity for all of the American people.
