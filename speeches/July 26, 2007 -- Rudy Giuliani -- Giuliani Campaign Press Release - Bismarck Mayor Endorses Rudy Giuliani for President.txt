    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of John Warford, Mayor of Bismarck, North Dakota. Mayor Warford, who is a former Republican National Committeeman for the North Dakota Republican Party, will serve as the Giuliani campaign's North Dakota Finance Chairman, leading the effort to build financial support throughout the state.
"Mayor Giuliani has demonstrated the strong executive leadership skills the people of North Dakota respect and look for in a President," said Mayor Warford. "As a Mayor myself, I admire how Rudy Giuliani achieved real results by using fiscally conservative principles to transform New York's deficit into a surplus, while also cutting taxes and dramatically reducing crime."
"The endorsement of Mayor Warford will have major benefits for Rudy's campaign in North Dakota," said Giuliani's National Political Director Mark Campbell. "We are honored to have the Mayor of one of North Dakota's largest cities helping to communicate to the voters Mayor Giuliani's optimistic vision for America."
