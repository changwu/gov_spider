    The United States commends Prime Minister Hariri and President Sleiman for their stewardship during the government formation process, and looks forward to working with the next Lebanese government on behalf of the people of Lebanon. We hope that the cabinet statement and government program will reflect a commitment to full implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701. The United States will stand by those partners who share our commitment to Lebanese sovereignty. We look forward to working with a new Lebanese government that is committed to extending its authority over all of Lebanon, and to advancing political and economic reforms that benefit the people of Lebanon. Pursuing these goals presents a clear path towards the advancement of peace and stability, and economic opportunity – both in Lebanon and the region. Lebanon will play a key role in the effort to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. There can be no lasting solution in the region reached at Lebanon’s expense.
