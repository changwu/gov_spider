    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD â€“ John Delaney will campaign in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico by the end of the year.
Delaney releases the following statement:
"I'm truly excited to announce our 50 state plan. Voters in every state should be a part of this primary. Voters from Alaska to Puerto Rico should hear from the candidates asking for their vote and the candidates should hear from the people. We're all running to be the President of this great country, from coast to coast, from small towns to big cities. It is hard to fully understand the American experience, how it sets the backdrop for where we are as a nation, without being all of the places it has unfolded.
"In so many places, Democrats got wiped out over the last decade. We stopped showing up, we stopped putting in the miles and putting in the work. We can't write off rural America, we can't write off red states, and we can't stay within our bubble.
"Right now so many Americans, of all backgrounds and political persuasions, feel like they're being left out and left behind. They feel like their government doesn't hear them, that the economy isn't working for them, and that their story isn't being told. My campaign is about changing that. As always, I will be joined by April and parts of my family for many of these trips and we hope to stay connected with everyone from the road."
