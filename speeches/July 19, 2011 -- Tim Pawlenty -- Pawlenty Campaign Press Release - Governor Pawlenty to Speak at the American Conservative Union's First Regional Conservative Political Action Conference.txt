    The Pawlenty for President campaign announced today that Gov. Tim Pawlenty will speak at the American Conservative Union's first regional Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida on September 23rd.
"CPAC has played a pivotal role in energizing the national Republican party, and I and my fellow Floridians are proud to host the first regional CPAC here in the Sunshine State," said Rep. Will Weatherford. "CPAC provides a unique opportunity for voters to get better acquainted with the candidates, and I know that when the citizens of Florida meet Gov. Tim Pawlenty they will see what I see â€“ a man of results with a clear vision to restore our economy and get our nation back on the right track. Gov. Pawlenty is the best candidate in the field to overcome our nation's economic challenges, and I look forward to watching him begin his path to victory in Florida."
