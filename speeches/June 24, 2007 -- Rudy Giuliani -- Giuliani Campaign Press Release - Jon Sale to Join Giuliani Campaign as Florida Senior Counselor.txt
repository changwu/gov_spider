    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Jon Sale has joined Mayor Giuliani's Florida campaign team as Senior Counselor. Sale will also serve on the Mayor's Miami-Dade County leadership team.
Sale, a prominent Florida attorney, is a graduate of New York University Law School and a former federal prosecutor. Sale is also a former professor of Nova Southeastern Law School of Ft. Lauderdale and a current adjunct professor at St. Thomas University Law School in Miami Gardens, Florida.
"Rudy Giuliani has displayed the kind of leadership we need to deal with the unique challenges facing the country. From reducing crime to cutting taxes Rudy Giuliani solved tough problems as Mayor of New York City. That's exactly the kind of record of results we need in Washington," Sale said.
"We're happy to have a lawyer of Jon's caliber and reputation helping guide the Florida campaign," Giuliani National Political Director Mark Campbell said.
