    Today I accepted the resignation of Scooter Libby. Scooter has worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and sacrificed much in the service to this country. He served the Vice President and me through extraordinary times in our Nation's history.
Special Counsel Fitzgerald's investigation and ongoing legal proceedings are serious, and now the proceedingsâ€”the process moves into a new phase. In our system, each individual is presumed innocent and entitled to due process and a fair trial.
While we're all saddened by today's news, we remain wholly focused on the many issues and opportunities facing this country. I've got a job to do and so do the people who work in the White House. We've got a job to protect the American people, and that's what we'll continue working hard to do.
I look forward to working with Congress on policies to keep this economy moving. And pretty soon, I'll be naming somebody to the Supreme Court.
Thank you all very much.
