    Dear Madam Chairwoman: (Dear Mr. Chairman:) 
In accordance with section 303(a)(6)(A) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the "Act") (50 U.S.C. 4533(a)(6)(A)), I transmit herewith notice of a shortfall in the defense industrial base relating to production capability for Light Rare Earth Elements and of action to remedy that shortfall. The Department of Defense will take actions to develop and purchase equipment and materials needed for creating, maintaining, protecting, and expanding production capability for Light Rare Earth Elements.
I have also included my determination required pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act. These proposed initiatives are essential to the national defense.
DONALD J. TRUMP
