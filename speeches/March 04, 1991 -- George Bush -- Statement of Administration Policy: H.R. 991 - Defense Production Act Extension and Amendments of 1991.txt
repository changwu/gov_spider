    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Carper (D) DE and 9 co-sponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 991. However, the Administration will work in conference to limit the extension of all authorities in the bill to no later than September 30, 1991. This includes Section 8, which otherwise would make permanent the authority under the Defense Production Act to investigate and prohibit, on national security grounds, a merger, acquisition, or takeover of a domestic industry by a foreign individual. The temporary extension of DPA authority will allow Congress and the Administration more time to consider substantive amendments to the Act.
