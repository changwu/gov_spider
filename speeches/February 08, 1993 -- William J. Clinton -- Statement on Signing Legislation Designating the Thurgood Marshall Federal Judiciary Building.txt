    Today, I am signing into law, S. 202, which designates the newly-completed Federal Judiciary Building in Washington, D.C. as the "Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building." It is fitting that a building which houses the work of more than 2000 judicial employees be named after a man who dedicated more than six decades of his life to public service in the judicial arena. Leading the legal arm of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Thurgood Marshall worked tirelessly for more than a quarter century to dismantle racial segregation in all manner of human endeavor. His twenty-nine victories before the U.S. Supreme Court serve as a reminder to the American people of our individual potential to have a dramatic impact in our service to others.
Marshall brought the same fervent commitment to social equality to his work as an appeals court judge, the Solicitor General of the United States and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. His insistent vision for America is a legacy which I hope we will cherish and strive to fulfill.
