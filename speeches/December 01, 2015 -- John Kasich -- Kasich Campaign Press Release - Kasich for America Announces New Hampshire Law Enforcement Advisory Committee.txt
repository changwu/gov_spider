    Kasich for America today announced the formation of a Law Enforcement Advisory Committee composed of 12 active and retired law enforcement officers in New Hampshire.
"Governor Kasich understands the unique challenges facing the law enforcement community today," said Sheriff Wiggin. "He's demonstrated a great willingness to listen to our perspective on fighting the drug epidemic in New Hampshire, improving community-police relations, and making our neighborhoods safer."
Kasich said, "I'm grateful to this dedicated group of officers who will provide insight and counsel on how we can build greater trust and cooperation between law enforcement officers and the people they serve. Like Ohio, New Hampshire is facing a brutally destructive drug epidemic. I look forward to hearing from this committee about what is working well in New Hampshire to combat the problem and how we can help other states in their own battles against drug abuse and addiction."
