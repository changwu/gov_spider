In-town pool report #6 — rolling back to DC 
The crowd of Trump supporters outside the gates grew considerably in the hour or so we spent waiting. New additions include thin blue line flag, Gadsden flag, a handwritten "Voter Fraud" sign, and a man wearing a Trump inner tube.
A number of cars driving by antagonized the crowd, holding Biden-Harris signs out of open windows. A woman driving an orange VW Bug flashed a Trudeau salute.

USSS SUVs exited Trump National at 1:52pm. We've rejoined the motorcade and are rolling back to DC. One woman wearing a wig and ski boots yelled "we love him! We don't love you" through a bullhorn as the press vans drove past her.
