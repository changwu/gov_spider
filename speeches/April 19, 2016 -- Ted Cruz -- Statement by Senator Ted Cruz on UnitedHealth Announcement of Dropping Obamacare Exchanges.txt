HOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz issued the following statement in light of news that the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth, will be pulling out of Obamacare marketplaces in all but a few states next year:
"UnitedHealth has announced it is pulling out of the Obamacare exchanges. That's the latest in a string of Obamacare failures that have led to American families losing their doctors, having few or no insurance options, and facing skyrocketing premiums and deductibles.
"Sadly, none of this comes as a surprise. Conservatives predicted this result years ago, and yet here we are: with health insurance that is worse and costs more, with a system that kills jobs and lowers paychecks, and with a federal government that stands between Americans and their doctors.
"Strikingly, this slow-rolling catastrophe has been lost on the other two Republicans in the presidential race: one who actually expanded Obamacare as governor, and the other who wants to go further than Obamacare and implement universal health care. Both John Kasich and Donald Trump would dig the country deeper into the Obamacare hole.
"That's why I have consistently opposed Obamacare and will begin the process of repealing and replacing this disastrous law from the first days of my administration as President. We literally cannot afford to have Obama's signature failure continue to drag down our economy, destroy what's left of our health care market, and punish American families. I will repeal Obamacare and replace it with health care that's personal, portable, and affordable, and stops getting in between patients and their doctors."
