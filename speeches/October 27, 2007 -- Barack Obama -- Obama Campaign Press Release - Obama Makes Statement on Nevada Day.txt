    Barack Obama Supporters Gather in Carson City as Part of the Nevada Day Parade
Carson City, NV -- This morning Barack Obama campaign supporters and volunteers gathered in Carson City to celebrate Nevada Day. Obama volunteers and staffers walked the parade route, handing out literature and spreading Obama's message of change to fellow Nevadans.
To commemorate Nevada Day, Barack Obama made the following statement:
"Nevada Day is not only about celebrating the Silver State's rich past, but also looking ahead to the future. We need to restore the voice of the people in government and put an end to the power of special interests and lobbyists. Together we can unite this country and get to work on real issues, like ending the war in Iraq and making health care affordable and accessible to all Nevadans."
