    Today, the president-elect hosted a virtual meeting with Latino leaders. Joined by Vice President-elect Harris; Xavier Becerra, Secretary-designate of Health and Human Services; Miguel Cardona, Secretary-designate of Education; and Isabel Guzman, Administrator-designate of the Small Business Administration, President-elect Biden discussed his proposals to fund vaccines, distribute them equitably, and provide an economic lifeline to those who are struggling, and his day one plans to introduce immigration reform legislation and protect DACA recipients.
President-elect Biden thanked the leaders for meeting with him and for their support and counsel over the years.
The group discussed the challenges facing the majority of Latino workers who do not have the option of working remotely, and the many Latino children who do not have access to high speed internet needed for remote learning. President-elect Biden highlighted the importance of getting the virus under control, protecting the health and safety of essential workers, and re-opening schools so students can be back in the classroom and to relieve pressure on parents.
The group also expressed strong support for the president-elect's historic Latino cabinet nominations, and the importance of having an administration that reflects the diversity of our nation.
