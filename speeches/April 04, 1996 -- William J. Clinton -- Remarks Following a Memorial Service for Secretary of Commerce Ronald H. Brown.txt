    Ladies and gentlemen, we just had a very moving memorial service not only to grieve but to celebrate the life of Secretary Brown and the other employees of the National Government, our military people, and the business leaders who were on that mission. We thanked God for their lives, we prayed for their families, and we came together in our grief and rededication. And we pointed out that it was 28 years ago on this day that Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis, working for what he believed in.
Today I spoke with the parents of one of the young women who died who worked for the Department of Commerce, who said they had spent their careers as schoolteachers, raising their daughter to believe that she could make a difference and that she ought to try. And they were very proud that she died doing what she believed in, trying to aid the peace in Bosnia.
And so that is how we are trying to think about this very difficult thing on this beautiful spring day in Easter Week.
Thank you very much.
