Pool was led out to the South Lawn for the 10 am arrival ceremony.
A stage with a lectern has been set up just south of the South Portico, with a clear area ahead of it (where Marine 1 typically lands).
To the sides and behind the press riser are roped off areas where thousands of invited guests — the vast majority, it appears, Indian-American - have gathered. Many are waving small Indian and US flags.
Some were chanting "Modi, Modi."
Orchestral music is coming over the loudspeakers (Battle Hymn of the Republic right now) as a light drizzle comes down.
This is an open press event that is also being streamed on the WH web site.

"India is a democracy. Democracy is in our DNA. Democracy is our spirit. Democracy runs in our veins."
"There is absolutely no space for discrimination."
"There is absolutely no discrimination."
President Biden, asked about what efforts he had made to push Modi on human rights, repeated general comments about the importance of democracy and individual freedoms and human rights.
"The prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values."
"There's an overwhelming respect for each other because we're both democracies."
"I believe in the dignity of every citizen."
Biden, asked about whether his comment that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was a "dictator" would cause problems with relations with that country, said it would not.
He said that his using language reflecting "what I think is fact" about China was not going to complicate the relationship.
"I don't think it's had any real consequence."
In their prepared remarks delivered prior to taking questions, both men repeated earlier points that the countries are strong allies and becoming stronger. Biden said that Modi's visit will be the occasion to announce new agreements on investment in high tech industries, an increase in the number of Indian students studying here and the opening of new consulates in each other's countries.

WH pool report 21 — Modi return from Capitol
The president and first lady appeared at 1837 at the North Portico door for the return of Prime Minister Modi from his visit to the Capitol. The president in a black tux, Jill Biden in a long green dress.
Modi emerged from the black SUV at 1838 after it pulled to a stop, having swapped his tunic for a collared white dress shirt and the blue pullover for a tweed-like vest.
They shook hands, posed for a photo and went inside.

WH pool report 22 — grand staircase photo op
President Biden, Jill Biden and Prime Minister Modi came down the Grand Staircase in White House, beside the portrait of President Obama, at 1906.
They were still dressed as they were in pool report 21, although with a closer view, it appears the prime minister's vest was silk, not wool.
This was a photo op. That is all.

WH pool report 23 - state dinner toasts
Pool was led across the South Lawn down to a "tent" set up beside the fountain, which is more of a pavilion, where the dinner is being held.
Trolleys ferried guests around the driveway from the White House, who then entered through a covered walkway, serenaded by a string band.
Hunter Biden was among those in the trolley that arrived just as pool was being escorted in.
There was much green decor inside — tablecloths, roof, decorative hangings, walls, trees, etc.

WH pool report 24 — state dinner toasts, part 2
The president, the first lady and Prime Minister Modi were introduced at 2025 and made their way forward to the strains of Hail to the Chief.
Biden and Modi offered brief remarks, and in turn offered pre-dinner toasts.
"The good news for both is us, neither of us drinks," Biden said, waiting for glasses to be brought to them. "Ginger ale, okay."
The president repeated his frequent joke about his grandfather having told him that if you offer a toast with a non-alcoholic drink, you must do it with your left hand.
"Two great nations, two great friends, and two great powers. Cheers."
Your pooler then learned that the Hindi translation for "cheers" is, in fact, "cheers."
Modi again thanked Biden for the invitation. "You are soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong"
He then offered a toast "to liberty and the everlasting bonds of friendship between India and the United States."
The pool was escorted out of the dinner tent/pavillon at 2051.

Foreign Pool Report # 1
Hi,
I am your foreign pooler on this historic day -- celebration of democracy and meeting of the leaders from the two largest democracies of the world. In the morning from the South Lawns of the White House, you will see several thousand Indian Americans for the Welcome ceremony.
Indian Americans have come from as far as Texas, California. But a large number of them are from the DMV area and New York and New Jersey and they have come in several dozens of buses. Some of the buses in New Jersey, I have been told, left early in the morning to arrive here by 7.30 am. Yesterday, I met a few Indian Americans at Freedom Plaza who said they drove around 700 miles from Tennessee to attend this ceremonial welcome. A group of Indian Americans took a charter flight from Texas to be here.This could be one of the largest gatherings during a welcome ceremony in recent years.
The Prime Minister arrived here yesterday. In addition to the events at the WH, the PM would address a Joint meeting of the US Congress. This is his second address to the US Congress and the only Indian leader to do so. Only a few world leaders have addressed the Joint Meeting of the Congress more than once.
Among his other important engagements while he is in town till Friday would be meeting with leaders from the corporate sector, and addressing the Indian Diaspora at Ronald Regan building Friday evening.
From here PM Modi travels to Egypt before heading back to India.
I am told there would be a series of announcements and quite a number of fact sheets being issued throughout today. And of course a joint statement. Please look at the background briefing by senior administration officials yesterday, which will give you a sense about the things to come in the next couple of hours.
I will keep you posted throughout the day
