    Vice President Mike Pence spoke to hundreds of our brave law enforcement officers and Cops for Trump members from around the country who are facing a constant barrage of attacks from Joe Biden and the Democrat Party. The Vice President reaffirmed the Trump Administration's commitment to always back the blue and support the men and women who keep our streets safe:
"The truth is, you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. After years of plummeting crime rates under President Trump, Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence on the streets of America's cities. When Democrats call for defunding the police, I don't have to tell all of you what's at stake: it's law and order. It's safety. It's the peace of mind that you, your family, and every family in the communities where you serve have the right to enjoy as citizens of the greatest nation on earth. So I want you to hear this directly from me, to all the men and women of law enforcement who are gathered on this call, on behalf of the President of the United States and our entire administration: we're not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever. We're going to back the blue."
