    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Maine Governor John Baldacci.
"It will take a leader with Hillary's strength and experience to bring the change that America needs," Governor Baldacci said. "She will be ready to lead on her first day in office."
"Our country faces enormous challenges. We need a President who can deliver on health care, who understands the world's complexities and who has the strength, character and experience to lead our nation. Hillary Clinton is the best person for that very tough job."
Elected Governor in 2002 and reelected in 2006, Gov. Baldacci has dramatically expanded health care access for Mainers and pushed to preserve the state's environment.
Gov. Baldacci began his career as a Bangor City Councilman and a State Senator, before being elected to represent Maine's Second Congressional District from 1994 to 2002.
"I'm honored to have John's support, and I look forward to working together to bring our message of change across Maine and America."
