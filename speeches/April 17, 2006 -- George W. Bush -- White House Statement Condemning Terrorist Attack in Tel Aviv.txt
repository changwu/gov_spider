    We condemn the terrorist attack today in Tel Aviv in the strongest possible terms. It is a despicable act of terrorism, for which no excuse or justification is possible. We express our condolences to those who were injured, to the families of those who were killed, and to the people and Government of Israel.
The burden of responsibility for preventing terrorist attacks such as this one rests with the Palestinian Authority (PA). We have noted reactions by several Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, that defend or even applaud the barbaric act of terror committed in Tel Aviv today, as we have noted President Abbas's quick denunciation of it. Defense or sponsorship of terrorist acts by officials of the Palestinian Cabinet will have the gravest effects on relations between the PA and all states seeking peace in the Middle East. A Palestinian government that encourages or tolerates terrorism against innocent men, women, and children not only increases the level of violence against Israelis, but can as well only do great harm to the interests of the Palestinian people and ensure its own further isolation. We reiterate that the United States will have no contact with such a government, and we call upon all states to demand that it abandon its support for terror.
