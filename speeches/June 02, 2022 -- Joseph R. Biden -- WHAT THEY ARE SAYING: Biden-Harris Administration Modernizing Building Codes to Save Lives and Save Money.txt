    Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a National Initiative to Advance Building Codes that will help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments adopt the latest building codes and standards, enabling communities to be more resilient to hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that are intensifying due to climate change—while saving families money on utility bills through improved energy efficiency.
Deputy National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi announced the initiative in Miami, Florida, alongside FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary Kevin Bush, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, and a range of experts in climate resilience and building safety and efficiency.
