    On the heels of growing support in New Hampshire polls, Richardson moves past Edwards in Arizona and within striking distance of Obama in Iowa
SANTA FE, NM -- New polls show Governor Bill Richardson jumping into third place over John Edwards in Arizona, and within two points of Barack Obama in Iowa.
"We are not surprised that voters in a Western state like Arizona are gravitating toward Governor Richardson. They share the same core, Western values like moving aggressively toward energy independence, respecting our environment, maintaining fiscal accountability, and growing the economy," said campaign manager Dave Contarino.
The polls, by American Research Group, show Governor Richardson moving from four percent support to nine percent in Arizona, putting him ahead of John Edwards among Arizona voters, and surging from five percent to thirteen percent in Iowa. In addition, the Iowa poll shows Governor Richardson in first place among independent voters with twenty-five percent support.
"We're excited by this momentum in Arizona, a key February 5th state, and it matches what we're seeing across the country," said Contarino. "Our campaign continues to gain support. Governor Richardson is working tirelessly to advance his plan to get all of our troops out of Iraq, leaving no residual forces. He has the strongest energy plan of any candidate in the race. And he has the experience to turn plans into realities. Americans are responding."
A recent CNN poll shows Governor Richardson in third place in New Hampshire.
