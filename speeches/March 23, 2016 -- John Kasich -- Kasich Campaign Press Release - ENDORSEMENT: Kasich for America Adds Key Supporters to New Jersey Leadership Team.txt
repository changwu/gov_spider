    Today Kasich for America announced the expansion of its New Jersey leadership team to include a number of prominent public officials and political and business leaders from around the state.
Last month, former New Jersey Governor and EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman announced her support for Gov. Kasich's presidential campaign. She is joined today by the following leaders:
Former Congressman Dick Zimmer
Former New Jersey Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff
State Senator Jen Beck
Former Assemblywoman Barbara Wrigh
Former Rubio NJ Co-Chairs Tom Basta and Mike Thulen
Princeton Businessman Scott Sipprelle
Said Kasich, "Because of my close personal friendship with former Congressman Bob Franks and his family, I have always felt a close connection to New Jersey. I'm incredibly grateful for the support and expertise of each of these talented leaders as we expand our ground operations in advance of New Jersey's primary election."
