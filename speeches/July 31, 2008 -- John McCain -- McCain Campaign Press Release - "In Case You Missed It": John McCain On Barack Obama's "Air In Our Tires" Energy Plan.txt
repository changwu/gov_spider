John McCain
Town Hall Meeting
Racine, WI
July 31, 2008
John McCain: "Senator Obama says that he wants energy independence, but he's opposed to new drilling at home. He's opposed to nuclear power. He's opposed to an innovation prize for electric cars. My friends, we must begin immediately in drilling offshore so we can get some of the oil that's off our own coast. We have to begin that drilling and Senator Obama opposes it. He said that the high cost of gasoline doesn't bother him, only that it rose too quickly.
"Yesterday, he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas. My friends, let's do that, but do you think that's enough to break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil? I don't think so. So I believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution. We need to develop new alternative energies like wind, solar, tide, biofuels, but we also need to develop more existing energies like nuclear power and clean coal."

Background:
Barack Obama Said That To Save On Energy Americans Can Inflate Their Tires. BARACK OBAMA: "There are things that you can do individually though to save energy; making sure your tires are properly inflated, simple thing, but we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune-ups. You could actually save just as much." (Barack Obama, Springfield, MO, 7/30/08)
