    The Vermont for Hillary campaign today announced the opening of its second office in the Green Mountain State. The campaign's Rutland office will serve as a hub for grassroots activities and Get Out the Vote Efforts in the days leading up to the primary.
"The opening of the Rutland office will help bolster our already strong grassroots organization," said Nancy Richardson, Vermont State Director. "We are excited to have another location where volunteers, supporters and staff can gather to organize and share Senator Clinton's message with voters across the state."
The Rutland office is located at 734 U.S. Route 4 E. Those interested in volunteering should contact Julie Zelnick at (651) 756-0244.
The Vermont campaign, led by co-chairs Governor Madeleine Kunin and Speaker Gaye Symington, has been working actively to reach voters throughout the state. In the past week, it has opened an office in Burlington, and held regular phone bank and visibilities. The campaign also announced this week an experienced and committed team of staff members and volunteers stationed in the Green Mountain State.
