    
These photos tell the story of Hillary for Iowa.
For the last nine months, the Hillary for Iowa team has been using the hashtag #ISpyIowa to document their travels across the Hawkeye State as they canvassed, phone banked, and organized to help Hillary Clinton win the Iowa caucus.
There is nothing more beautiful than engaging with purpose, organizing with heart, and winning every single day.

But when they were done taking in the view, Team Iowa got to work—wherever they could find a spot.


  My "corner office" at North Side Cafe. What a view for call time! #ISpyIowa #Hillary2016 pic.twitter.com/liFqwPR3XR— Michael M. Kimmelman (@Kimmelmonster) May 12, 2015

And when they did get an office, a Hillary supporter who lived in the neighborhood helped them furnish it.


  Thanks Sally for letting @DianaBonete and I raid your barn for office furniture! #ISpySally #ISpyIowa pic.twitter.com/eS8vobcKxF— Sarah Andrews (@sa_elizabeth) June 1, 2015

But that didn't keep them from working outside—the Iowa summer is just too beautiful for organizers to stay indoors!


  Nice day in #Iowa to work outside and google hangout with some @HillaryforIA organizers! #ispyiowa @adinofacollege pic.twitter.com/EsqgGP4VlE— Lillie (@lilliecatlin) May 28, 2015

Plus, they had to start knocking on doors and collecting commit cards. The election was only eight months away!

Thankfully, thousands of people came on board to help Hillary win in Iowa.
