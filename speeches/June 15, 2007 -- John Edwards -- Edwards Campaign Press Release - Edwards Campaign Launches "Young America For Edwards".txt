    Announces the support of young leaders and unveils "Young America for Edwards" website
Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, the John Edwards for President campaign announced the launch of its "Young America for Edwards" initiative to get young people involved in Senator John Edwards' campaign and to recognize all the hard work young Americans are already doing to transform our country and the world. During a speech at Cyzygy '07, City Year's annual convention taking place in Manchester, New Hampshire, Elizabeth Edwards called on young people to start taking action today to change our country. As part of the initiative, the campaign has launched a new website, http://johnedwards.com/youngamerica, which includes information on Edwards' bold plans to help ensure that young people have the same opportunities he has enjoyed in life. Edwards has laid out detailed plans to guarantee quality, affordable health care to every American, eliminate poverty in America and make college more affordable.
"Everywhere I look, young people are taking bold action," said Elizabeth Edwards. "Like John, young people understand that we do not have to wait to change the world. We can act today. All we need is a little bit of passion and an abiding belief that together, we can bring the change we want to see to America."
John and Elizabeth Edwards' effort to get young people involved in the campaign includes a "Summer of Action" program to encourage young people to take action on the important issues facing our country and bring about the bold change our country needs. Already, young people are leading on issues like stopping the genocide in Darfur, fighting global warming and ending the war in Iraq. As part of the program, young people can visit the "Young America" website and sign up for community service projects, connect with other young people, and send the campaign videos and pictures of themselves taking action to change our country.
Today, Senator Edwards received the support of several leaders from the youth community.
"I am excited to have the support of these young leaders," said Senator Edwards. "Young people have changed America before and are changing America again, and that's why I am proud that these young leaders are standing up and joining me in our campaign to build the America we all believe in."
"John Edwards earns my support because he is willing to roll up his sleeves, get his hands dirty and support the work in our communities," said Malia Lazu, a board member of the League of Young Voters. "He is joining us in taking action every day to make change and understands that our generation is not waiting for the next president to fix the problems we face in our everyday lives."
"He has consistently talked about his position on the war in Iraq," said Evan Brunson, immediate past President of the Howard University College Democrats. "Supporting the troops and ending this war is a testament to his political courage."
"We need leadership on the issue of global warming more than ever," said Jessy Tolkan, Campaign Director of the Energy Action Coalition. "My experience with young activists all across the country shows me what that leadership looks like and how important it is, and I see it in the action and policies of John Edwards."
