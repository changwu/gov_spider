    I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed the nomination of Alan Greenspan for another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Chairman Greenspan's wise and steady leadership has inspired confidence here in America and around the world. He has made a truly remarkable contribution in helping lead our Nation to the longest economic expansion in history. I look forward to continuing the productive and appropriate relationship that my administration has enjoyed with Chairman Greenspan and the other excellent members of the Federal Reserve Board in working to extend this era of American prosperity. I am hopeful that the Senate will move quickly to confirm the other two nominees to the Federal Reserve Board as well.
