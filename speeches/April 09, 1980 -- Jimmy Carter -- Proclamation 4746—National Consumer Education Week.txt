  A Proclamation

America's economy is the largest and most complex in the history of the world. It offers an unparalleled choice of goods and services. For our economy to work best for our people, all of us must have the information and knowledge we need to make intelligent decisions as consumers.
Every citizen can benefit from knowing more about consumer laws, rights, and avenues of redress. Many people?including the young, the elderly and the poor-need help in learning about buying skills, financial management, resource conservation methods, and self-help or alternative solutions to economic constraints. In addition, educated consumers can do much to ensure genuine competition, increased productivity, higher quality, and lower prices in the marketplace.
Many good programs for consumer education, public and private, are now in place. But we need a more comprehensive and coordinated approach. Just as our democratic political system needs well-informed citizens, our free economy needs well-informed consumers who can participate effectively in the marketplace partnership among consumers, government, and business.
Schools, governments, consumer organizations, labor unions, and businesses all can play a role in meeting this challenge. I call upon each of these sectors to examine closely how, individually and collectively, they can initiate and support consumer education.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 5, 1980, as National Consumer Education Week.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
