    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Simon (D) Illinois and 33 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of the Foreign Affairs Committee substitute for S. 985, if the bill is amended to address the following concerns.

—   The substitute would unnecessarily micromanage foreign assistance programs by prohibiting certain forms of assistance to Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan unless the President certifies that certain conditions have been met. In addition, it would require that development assistance and assistance from the Development Fund for Africa be provided only through private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and international organizations without such a certification.
—   The substitute would further micromanage by defining in statute assistance priorities for the countries listed above.
—   The provision of the substitute which purports to establish United States policy in promoting peace and development for the region should be made explicitly advisory. 
Accordingly, the Administration urges that this legislation not be considered under suspension of the rules, but rather under a rule that would allow modification of the bill as noted above.
