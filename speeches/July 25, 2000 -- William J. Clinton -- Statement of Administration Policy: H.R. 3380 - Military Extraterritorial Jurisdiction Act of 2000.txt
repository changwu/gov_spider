    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Chambliss (R) GA and McCollum (R) FL)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 3380, which would close a loophole in Federal criminal jurisdiction that has enabled persons to avoid prosecution for serious offenses committed outside the United States, often against American victims.
