    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Enclosed please find my blueprint for nationwide education reform entitled, "No Child Left Behind." I look forward to working with the Congress to ensure that these principles are turned into acceptable legislation that leaves no child behind.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
