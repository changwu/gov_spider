    President Donald J. Trump applauds the U.S. Senate for voting to pass the VA MISSION Act today, an important piece of legislation that will transform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) into a high-performing and integrated healthcare system for the 21st century and provide Veterans with more Choice in their healthcare options, whether from VA doctors or from the community.
Passing this legislation is another promise made and promise kept to America's Veterans under President Trump's leadership, which has provided the most substantial VA reform in a generation.
The Administration will continue implementing policies that transform and modernize the VA to better serve our nation's heroes.
