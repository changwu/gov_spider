During his news briefing at the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Rex Granum was asked a question concerning an interview in which former President Nixon stated his views on whether or not a President had the right to break the law. The questioner asked Mr. Granum what President Carter's views were on that issue. Mr. Granum replied that "based on the interview as reported in that publication, President Carter does not feel that any President has the right to break the law. He feels very strongly that it is a tragic mistake to follow that philosophy, as past events have shown so dramatically. He does feel that there are adequate judicial means to prevent danger to the country."
