Republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats and now are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process because just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that.....Retweets: 13694Favorites: 60207

.....the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one. As he said 'No Pressure.' This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax which has been going on since before I even got elected.

'It does appear it has to do with Nancy Pelosi retaining her Speakership in the next Congress.

The Democrats have been on this path for 3 years. The first headline I saw...before the President was sworn in was that the Impeachment process was beginning...so this is just further evidence that this is what they had in mind from the very beginning. @senatemajldr https://t.co/scFWSh47BqRetweets: 20062Favorites: 63830
