    Today South Carolina Senator Ronnie Cromer announced he has joined Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign as a member of the Kasich for America Steering Committee.
Said Cromer, "I am greatly impressed by John Kasich's historic role as a budget-balancer in Congress and his success as governor in turning things around in Ohio. It's clear he's a problem solver who knows how to get things done. I also appreciate the respect he's showing for South Carolina voters by running such a positive, optimistic campaign."
A longtime community leader and small-business owner in Newberry County, Ronnie Cromer has represented the 18th Senate District since 2003. A pharmacist by profession, he is also a Lt. Colonel (ret.) in the South Carolina Army National Guard.
