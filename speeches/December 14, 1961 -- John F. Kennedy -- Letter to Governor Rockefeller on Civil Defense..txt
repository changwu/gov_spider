Dear Governor Rockefeller:
I wish to express my personal thanks for the advice and assistance you have given in shaping the program on civil defense which I shall present to the Congress next year. Through your participation in the Civil Defense Committee of the Governors Conference you have helped the Department of Defense, to whom I have given the responsibility for our fallout shelter program, reach the indispensable understanding of problems at the state and local levels which any successful program must plan to meet.
I have assigned responsibility for the shelter program to the Department of Defense to underline the fact that a civil defense effort must be kept in proper perspective in relation to our other defense efforts, as well as because of the organizational and technical capabilities which that Department possesses.
I appreciate your taking the time from your busy schedule to help us in this way.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of the State of New York, Albany, New York]
