Shoppers in Georgetown stopped and stared as the motorcade went by, and at least one street was blocked by a police car. Pool stopped at 35th and N Street and saw POTUS walk up steps into the grounds of Holy Trinity Catholic Church at 3.43pm. From a distance, it sounds like there is cheering and whooping inside. Curious members of the public are gathering nearby.

WH in-town pool report #11/ More detail on POTUS remarks to governors
POTUS's remarks were at times difficult to hear, especially when there was applause or laughter, so do check against the official transcript. Some highlights:
POTUS, wearing black tie, holding a microphone and standing beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, said: "The thing I liked about working with governors, we used to have to get things done... I served in the Senate for a long, long time and was vice president for eight years and governors, you've got to get it done.
"You've gotta fix the potholes, you've gotta take care of crime in the streets, you've got to do everything and you can't say, we're going to put it off, we're going to debate it for about six months. It's a pleasure working with you all and Jill, Kamala and Doug and I are really happy to have you here at the White House.
"I want to thank you... Last two to six years, I mean, things have been up and down and so you really had to be on your toes, you had to be ready to answer all the questions that you get asked. As I said, I don't think it's been a tougher two years being a governor. That's why we started off with the [inaudible] piece of legislation making sure you had enough money.
"And look, the partnership that we've had - I don't want to ruin anybody's reptuations here - the partnership has been [inaudible], whether you're Republican or Democrat on things that affect your state. I said I wanted to be president for everybody, not just blue states or red states, but for everybody.
"... I know we're not going to always agree. I think we agree more than you pretend but I don't blame you... But look, I think that when we're together, we're able to get things done. I know I don't talk about bipartisanship all the time. I'm ready to fight, as you all are, and I spent a lot of time in Congress and then as vice president.
"But, you know, one thing that I found is - one of the reasons I made sure we had so many governors in my administration, and mayors, I mean this sincerely, you've got to get things done. And I kid Jennifer Granholm, if she were born in the United States, she'd be standing here talking to you... But all kidding aside, I think we've made some bipartisan progress. For example, the idea that we have over a trillion 200 billion dollars in infrastructure to rebuild this country.
"... bipartisan action and it matters, this matters. The good news is - I shouldn't say good news – the most important thing we have to do is let people know what we've done because it's just started. Like, for example, when we did the legislation dealing with pharma, people are now coming up - and I imagine they may come up to you too - and say, you mean it only costs me 35 bucks and not 450 bucks?... We pay the highest drug prices in the world but because of the number of Republicans crossing over and joining us to make sure we got the last section done, things are changing.
"... I hope we're going to get a little bit - I'm going to try - a little bit less partisan and work on things and really get down to changing people's lives. And again, we're not going to agree, we're not going to always agree, but I think when we work together, it works. And I'm not going to go into any detail about the infrastructure law or the CHIPS and Science Act.
"... I'm determined as you are... to lead the world again in manufacturing. The CHIPS and Science Act invested in America. Again, I called the governor of Illinois - I'm not joking - he encouraged me to keep moving on this because... we used to spend 2% of our GDP on research and development in America; we spend 0.7%. We used to be number one; now we're 17th. So change matters. This is the United States of America.
"... So, look, I want to thank Governor Murphy, Governor Cox for their leadership. And Governor Cox, I promise I won't tell anybody how much I like you. We will keep it quiet... Remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. We can get big things done. God bless America."

WH in-town pool report #14/ Brad Paisley refers to Ukraine; Lid called
At 9.22pm country music artist Brad Paisley, wearing a white cowboy hat, black suit and black tie, performed the song 'American Saturday Night', singing and playing guitar on stage in the East Room.
He explained: "I had to change the second line because it mentioned Russia and I don't do that any more."
(A Google search reveals the original lyrics were: 'She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car/ Listening to the Beatles singing, "Back in the U.S.S.R."')
Instead Paisley sang: 'She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car./ There's a Ukrainian flag hanging up behind the bar.'
POTUS, sitting on the front row beside FLOTUS, was among those who applauded the reference to Ukraine. Pool was escorted out of the East Room after the song and a lid was called at 9.35pm.
