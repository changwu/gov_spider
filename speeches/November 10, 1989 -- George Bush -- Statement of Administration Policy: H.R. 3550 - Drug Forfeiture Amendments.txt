    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hughes (D) New Jersey)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3550, which is consistent with the Administration's proposal to make funds available to the Special Forfeiture Fund (SFF) periodically throughout the year rather than only at the end of the year. In 1990, the SFF will be used to help finance additional Federal prison construction, as proposed in the President's Drug Control Strategy.
The Administration will seek deletion in conference of:

section 2(c), which makes SFF funds unavailable after January 31, 1990, if the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy has not designated high intensity drug trafficking areas by that date; and  
section 2(d), which inappropriately interferes with Presidential discretion over the timing and transmittal of supplemental appropriation requests.
