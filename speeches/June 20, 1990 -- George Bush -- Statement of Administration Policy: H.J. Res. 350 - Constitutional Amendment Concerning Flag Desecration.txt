    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Michel (R) Illinois and 185 others)
The Administration urges prompt adoption of H.J. Res. 350 so that it may be sent to the States for ratification as an amendment to the Constitution. A constitutional amendment is needed to ensure that the Nation's flag is protected in an appropriate manner.
Because H.R. 5091, the "Flag Protection Act of 1990," would not provide adequate protection against physical desecration of the flag, it is not a substitute for a constitutional amendment.
