    The American people and I have been shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic death of President and Mrs. Jaime Roldos Aguilera and the Minister of Defense and his wife, Major General and Mrs. Marco Subia Martinez.
Please accept our deepest condolences and our sympathy as we join the Educadorian people in mourning this terrible loss.
