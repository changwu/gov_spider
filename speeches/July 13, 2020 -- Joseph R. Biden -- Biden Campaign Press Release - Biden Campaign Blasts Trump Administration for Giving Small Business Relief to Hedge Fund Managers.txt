    Today, following new reporting in Reuters that the Trump Administration was issuing PPP loans intended for small businesses to the investment offices of some of the wealthiest families in America, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Donald Trump has never known what it's like to struggle, and he's made clear from his first day in office that his priority is lining the pockets of the wealthy and well-connected, not looking out for working families or the middle class. The news that some of America's wealthiest families were benefiting from federal aid intended for small businesses even in the middle of an avoidable economic collapse is despicable â€” but not surprising.
"We don't need more of Donald Trump's corrupt recovery. We need a plan to build back better. Joe Biden is laser-focused on rebuilding the middle class and ensuring that we exit this crisis with a stronger and more resilient economy that rewards work, and not just wealth."
