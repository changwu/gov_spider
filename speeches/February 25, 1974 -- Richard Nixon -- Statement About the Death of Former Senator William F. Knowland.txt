    IT WAS with a deep sense of personal loss that I learned of the tragic death of former Senator William F. Knowland.
Bill Knowland was a man of boundless energy and integrity, and I consider it an honor to have served with him in the United States Senate. As Republican leader in the Senate, and as a distinguished California newspaperman and community leader, Bill Knowland always put patriotism and principle first.
His loss will be particularly felt by all those who had the privilege of knowing and working with him. Mrs. Nixon and I extend our deepest sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
