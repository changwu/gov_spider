PAUL RYAN: "These serious times require serious solutions. And when you think about the closing moments of this campaign, this quote pretty much sums it up. I am going to read you a quote from four years ago. ‘If you don't have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about small things.' You know who said that four years ago? You do know who said that four years ago. That is what Barack Obama said in 2008. And in 2008, he appealed to our highest aspirations. Now, he's appealing to our lowest fears. Just yesterday, he was asking his supporters at a rally to vote out of revenge. Mitt Romney and I are asking you to vote out of love of country. That's what we do in this country. We don't believe in revenge. We believe in change and hope. We actually do."
