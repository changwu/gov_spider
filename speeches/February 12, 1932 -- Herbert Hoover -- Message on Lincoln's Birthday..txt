    THE STRENGTH of self government has been maintained, each generation stimulated and our daily life refreshed by the ideals and character of the men who have led the nation. Of those whose ideas, ideals, courage, patience and fortitude permeate every hour of our national thinking and national life, who inspire new courage and confidence in government by the people, none equal Washington and Lincoln.
I trust the commemoration of Lincoln's birth may rekindle intentions of every citizen to the nation and enhance their faith in its institutions and destiny.
