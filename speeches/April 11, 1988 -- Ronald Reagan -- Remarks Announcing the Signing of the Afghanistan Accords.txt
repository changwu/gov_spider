    Before welcoming our visitors, our guests here today, I have a brief announcement. I have to make it here because that's where the press is, and it's for them. I've just received a briefing from my national security advisers on the contents of the proposed Geneva agreements on Afghanistan that would provide for the complete withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces from that country. I believe the U.S. can now join the Soviet Union as a guarantor of the Geneva instruments. I've therefore asked Secretary [of State] Shultz to represent us at a signing ceremony for the historic accords as scheduled to take place in Geneva later this week.
This development would not have been possible had it not been for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country of foreign occupation. We take great pride in having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph, and they can count on our continued support. We also pledge our continued friendship and support to the Government and people of Pakistan, who have so generously hosted millions of Afghan refugees during this period of Soviet domination of Afghanistan.
