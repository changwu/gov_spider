    Barbara and I join all Americans in expressing our joy in the news that this afternoon workers at I - 880 in Oakland rescued a victim from Tuesday's earthquake. The miraculous recovery of Buck Helm is a tribute to the thousands of relief workers and volunteers who have been working so tirelessly in the bay area. I am delighted to know that the efforts of some of the heroic workers I met yesterday have now been rewarded with the saving of another life.
