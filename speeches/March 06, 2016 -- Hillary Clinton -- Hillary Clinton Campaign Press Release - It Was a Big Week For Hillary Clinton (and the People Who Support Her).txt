Presidential campaigns have highs, lows, and everything in between. The past week was a good one for Hillary Clinton and everyone standing behind her in this election.
It started with a huge win in South Carolina.

The next two days were a whirlwind as Hillary made stops in Tennessee ...

... Arkansas ...
... Massachusetts ...
... and Virginia.
Then came Super Tuesday, which lived up to its name.
While one Republican candidate talked about "making America great again," Hillary had a different message:
(And that was before she pulled off an important win in Massachusetts!)

The wins on Super Tuesday gave Hillary a commanding lead among pledged delegates.

The next day, Hillary took to LinkedIn to discuss an issue on a lot of people's minds: student loan debt.
Today on @LinkedIn: We need to solve America's student debt crisis. https://t.co/GyEmaYXOkF— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 29, 2016

And she was welcomed back to New York with open arms.
On Thursday, the Republican candidates took the stage for another debate.

Friday was all about jobs. Hillary gave a speech in Detroit with messages of optimism ...
"As Detroit proves every day, what has been broken can be re-built, stronger than before." —Hillary in Michigan— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 4, 2016

... and accountability ...
"If you cheat your employees, exploit your customers, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will hold you accountable." —Hillary— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 4, 2016

... and, of course, she laid out detailed solutions.

Voters in Louisiana made sure the week ended on a high note.
Thank you, Louisiana! pic.twitter.com/7KPEuA2mWJ— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 6, 2016

And Hillary kept talking about what we can accomplish—if we work together:
Diversity is a strength, not a weakness. If we lift each other up, we can make this country even stronger.https://t.co/76EVKvQ759— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 6, 2016

The best way to celebrate a great week? Keep working hard to earn every vote. As Hillary gets ready for the Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan, volunteers across the country are spending the day making phone calls and knocking on doors in their communities. There's still a long way to go, and it isn't going to be easy—but the hard work of Team Hillary is paying off.
