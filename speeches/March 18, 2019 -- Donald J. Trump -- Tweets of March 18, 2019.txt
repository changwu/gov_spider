What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election first at the 'ballot box' and then after that failed with the 'Insurance Policy' is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!Retweets: 36096Favorites: 127840

General Motors and the UAW are going to start 'talks' in September/October. Why wait start them now! I want jobs to stay in the U.S.A. and want Lordstown (Ohio) in one of the best economies in our history opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast! Car companies.....Retweets: 17357Favorites: 79639

....are all coming back to the U.S. So is everyone else. We now have the best Economy in the World the envy of all. Get that big beautiful plant in Ohio open now. Close a plant in China or Mexico where you invested so heavily pre-Trump but not in the U.S.A. Bring jobs home!Retweets: 18698Favorites: 87396

Joe Biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for President. Get used to it another low I.Q. individual!Retweets: 22652Favorites: 115678

The Fake News Media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand. They will have to work very hard to prove that one. So Ridiculous!Retweets: 29491Favorites: 136336

GDP growth during the four quarters of 2018 was the fastest since 2005. This Administration is the first on record to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office. GROWTH is beating MARKET EXPECTATIONS!Retweets: 21643Favorites: 87384

While the press doesn't like writing about it nor do I need them to I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400000.00 to different agencies throughout the year this to Homeland Security. If I didn't do it there would be hell to pay from the FAKE NEWS MEDIA! https://t.co/xqIGUOwh4xRetweets: 47856Favorites: 175858
