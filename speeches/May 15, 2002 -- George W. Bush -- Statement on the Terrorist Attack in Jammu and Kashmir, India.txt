    The United States condemns the terrorist attack carried out by militants in Jammu and Kashmir yesterday. On behalf of the American people, I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Jammu and Kashmir, whose citizens were killed in this attack.
Yesterday's attack was also aimed at destroying opportunities for South Asia to build a future that is more stable, more peaceful, and more prosperous. We will not allow terrorists to succeed in this larger mission. The United States will not yield in its determination to work with the people of South Asia to fight terrorism and to build a better future.
