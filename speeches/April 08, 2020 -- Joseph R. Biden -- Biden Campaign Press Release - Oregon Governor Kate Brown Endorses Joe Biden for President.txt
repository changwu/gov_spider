    Today, Oregon Governor Kate Brown released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"The focus of our nation's Governors right now is protecting the health and well being of those we represent. While we spend every moment of every day working together to get the resources we need to save lives, we are also looking to the President to do the same.
"I believe that Joe Biden will be a President who on day one will be able to start delivering for the American people. From helping pass the Affordable Care Act and the Recovery and Reinvestment Act to showing real and thoughtful leadership during crises -- Joe Biden's track record in times like these speaks for itself. For his entire career Joe has been a fighter for families, a focus that people all around the country need right now. We need his kind of humble and steadfast leadership to unite and heal our country in this challenging time."
Brown has served as Governor of Oregon since 2015. Prior to that, she served as Oregon's Secretary of State and in the Oregon State Legislature. She is the first openly LGBTQ person elected Governor in the United States of America.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
