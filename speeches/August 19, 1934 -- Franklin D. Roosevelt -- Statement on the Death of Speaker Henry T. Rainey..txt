This is especially true in the loss of Speaker Rainey at a time when the experience of many years had culminated in his useful leadership of the Nation's House of Representatives.
I had the privilege of knowing him first more than a score of years ago. I shall always think of him as a humanitarian whose fine patriotism thought first of what he conceived to be the well-being and the interests of the common man. Through all the years he kept the spirit of youth and he will be missed profoundly by old and young alike.
