The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don't want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, & that includes the House & Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!Retweets: 26476Favorites: 111713

Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isn't covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It's all the Fake News Media, and that's why nobody believes in them any more.Retweets: 25092Favorites: 114331

Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn't do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.Retweets: 25523Favorites: 103136

Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair!Retweets: 25131Favorites: 120860
