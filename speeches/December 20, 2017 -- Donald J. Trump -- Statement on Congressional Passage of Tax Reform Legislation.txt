    I promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting. I would like to thank the Members of Congress who supported this historic bill, which represents an extraordinary victory for American families, workers, and businesses. Unemployment continues to fall, the stock market is at a record high, and wages will soon be on the rise. By cutting taxes and reforming the broken system, we are now pouring rocket fuel into the engine of our economy. America is back to winning again, and we're growing like never before. There is a great spirit of optimism sweeping across our land. Americans can once again rest assured that our brightest days are still to come.
