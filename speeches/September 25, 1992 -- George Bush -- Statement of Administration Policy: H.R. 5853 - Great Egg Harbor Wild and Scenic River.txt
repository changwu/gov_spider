    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hughes (D) New Jersey)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5853. The bill would designate certain segments of the Great Egg Harbor River in New Jersey as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (the System). The Great Egg Harbor River has not been evaluated by the Executive branch as required under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (the Act).
The Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report on the suitability of a river for addition to the System. This process is not complete for the Great Egg Harbor River and should be allowed to continue.
