    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and two others)
The Administration would not object to House passage of H.R. 4054 if it were amended to: (1) ensure that the required reporting to Congress by Inspectors General (IG'S) and the President (with respect to removal of an IG) is constitutionally acceptable under the separation of powers principle, (2) provide safeguards to protect Department of Justice criminal investigations and (3) adopt language identical to that in S. 908, as passed by the Senate, that would create statutory IG's at the Department of the Treasury. The Administration is prepared to work closely with Congress to develop suitable amendments. Unless these amendments are adopted, however, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto of H.R. 4054.
