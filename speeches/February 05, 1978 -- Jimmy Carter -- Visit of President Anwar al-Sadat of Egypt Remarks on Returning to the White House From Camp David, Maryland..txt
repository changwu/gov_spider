    President Sadat and his wife, Jihan, I and my wife, Rosalynn, and our family, have had a very enjoyable 2 days at Camp David. During this time, President Sadat and I have had a chance to spend hours together discussing the relationships between our two countries and our renewed commitment to achieve a peaceful settlement of the differences that exist in the Middle East.
Yesterday afternoon, the Vice President, Secretary of State, and the distinguished leaders who accompanied President Sadat here from Egypt met with us for a more thorough discussion of all the issues that I've described so briefly.
During the rest of this week, President Sadat will be meeting with congressional leaders. He'll be making a speech tomorrow to the National Press Club and will be meeting with me again. And on Wednesday, when he departs, I will have a much more definitive statement to make about the results of our meeting.
We have thoroughly enjoyed being together. There is complete agreement between him and me about our determination to work, without ceasing, to bring peace to the Middle East. And we had a thorough discussion of other bilateral relationships concerning us in the Horn of Africa and other places around the world.
It's been a very enjoyable experience, President Sadat. And I look forward to seeing you again on Wednesday, after you've had this chance to meet with our officials and our Congress.
Thank you very much.
