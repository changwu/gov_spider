    Romney for President today announced its Sportsmen for Romney coalition. This community of sportsmen and women from across the country, along with the recent endorsement from the National Rifle Association, show that Mitt Romney has strong and growing support among our nation's conservationists and outdoor enthusiasts.
"I am grateful to have the support of so many great Americans who have chosen to be a part of Sportsmen for Romney," said Mitt Romney. "The wealth of this nation is not only in our industries and our businesses. We are blessed with great natural beauty as well. It is the sportsmen and women of America who keep safe that natural wealth for this generation and many more to come. Hunters, fishermen, sports-shooters, and outdoors enthusiasts not only create millions of jobs and pump billions of dollars into our economy, they stand on the forefront of defending our Second Amendment rights and protecting the natural wonder of our nation. If I am fortunate enough to become president, they will have a friend in the White House."
"This economic downturn is affecting people and communities at every level," said Richard Childress, president and CEO of Richard Childress Racing and a world-renowned big game hunter and conservationist. "We see across America that people don't have the discretionary income they used to. People are suffering and they need a change. I know something about leadership, and I know something about running a business. When I look at Mitt Romney, I see a man who is not only a leader, but one who understands what we need to get this economy back on track. That's why he has my support."
"Mitt Romney has a proven track record of turning around dysfunctional enterprises," said five-time Olympic medalist Kim Rhode. "For me, his greatest accomplishment remains his successful effort to save the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Governor Romney took the Games from scandal to glory, and he did so in the shadow of 9/11, at a time when every American needed something to rally around and something to believe in. Today we face similar challenges. Our economy is hurting, and the American people are looking for someone to lead us back to prosperity. Mitt Romney is that man. We have a choice in this election. We can have another four years like the last four. Or we can join Mitt Romney, turn a corner, and head down a new path. I'm with Mitt, and I hope people across this country will join me."
"Everyone knows that Mitt Romney is a world class businessman who knows how to create the jobs we need in this country," said conservationist Rob Keck. "What many people do not know is that Governor Romney is also committed to conservation and understands the role that hunters and sportsmen and women play in conservation. He won't let the federal government continue to place limits on this critical sector of our economy, and he will restore the prosperity that allows so many Americans to enjoy the natural wonders of our country. I am proud to give him my support."
