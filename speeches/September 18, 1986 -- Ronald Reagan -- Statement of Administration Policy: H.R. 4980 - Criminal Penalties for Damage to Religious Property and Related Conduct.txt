    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Glickman (D) Kansas and 35 others)
Although the Administration is certainly sympathetic to the aims of H.R. 4980, it opposes enactment of the bill. Offenses of the sort contemplated by H.R. 4980 — vandalism and related activities — have traditionally and more effectively been investigated and prosecuted at the State level. There is no compelling reason for the Federal Government to assert jurisdiction in this sensitive area at this time. To do so would violate important principles of Federalism.
