Travel pool #3 — remarks over/ comments on North Korea
President Biden entered the waterfall garden at the Grand Hyatt Seoul adjacent to a pool at about 11:14 am and spoke for roughly 14 minutes for his remarks with the chairman of the Hyundai Motor Group, Euisun Chung.
Biden celebrated Hyundai's recent announcement of an investment of $5.5 billion in the state of Georgia. "We're all committed to making it happen," Biden said. "Electric vehicles are good for our climate goals but also good for jobs and good for business."
CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked Biden if he was concerned about a potential nuclear test from North Korea. "We are prepared for anything North Korea does," Biden said. "I'm not concerned if that's what your asking," Biden said.
Collins then asked if Biden had a message for Kim Jong-un. "Hello," Biden said. After a couple seconds, the president followed up with "period."

His Excellency Yoon Suk Yeol, President of the Republic of KoreaGeneral Paul J. LaCamera, U.S. Army, Commander, U.S. Forces KoreaLieutenant General Sung Chun Choi, Commander, Air Force Operations Command, Republic of Korea Air Force
Background on Osan Air Base
Osan Air Base is one of the primary U.S. Air Force facilities in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and is home to 5,600 active duty U.S. military, 1,100 Department of Defense civilians, 2,300 dependents, and 3,500 ROK Air Force. The 51st Fighter Wing is headquartered at Osan Air Base and is equipped with 21 F-16 Fighting Falcons and 21 A-10 Warthogs.
Tour Stops
President Biden and President Yoon will participate in a tour of the Combat Operations Floor.
Tour guides:

General Paul J. LaCamera, U.S. Army, Commander, U.S. Forces Korea
Lieutenant General Sung Chun Choi, Commander, Air Force Operations Command, Republic of Korea Air Force

Stop 1: Overview and Day-To-Day Operations of the Combat Operations Floor
The 607th Air Operations Center (AOC), Combat Operations Division (COD) is in charge of monitoring and executing the Air Tasking Order (ATO). The division is split into two teams, offensive and defensive. The offensive team is in charge of controlling combat air assets against deliberate and dynamic targets that are approved by the Combined Forces Air Component Commander. The defensive team is charged with protecting the Defended and Critical Asset List, theater missile defense, as well as controlling defensive counter air missions throughout the Korean Theater of Operations.
Participants:

Colonel Jason Hokaj, U.S. Air Force, Commander, Air Operations Center
Brigadier General Young Sik Hwang, Republic of Korea Air Force, Commander, Korea Air and Space Operations Center
Colonel Anthony Kuczynski, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Chief, Combat Operations
Colonel Gwang Mu Suh, Republic of Korea Air Force, ROK Chief, Combat Operations

Stop 2: Air Force and Ground Forces Role in Dynamic Targeting
The Air Force utilizes multi-role aircraft, bombers, and ISR assets to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) targets of opportunity or emerging threats that were identified too late to be included into the deliberate targeting cycle. These targets may potentially be of critical or high value importance within a fleeting window to strike and may be categorized as Time Sensitive Targets.
The 3rd Battlefield Coordination Detachment (3BCD) is the liaison between the 607th AOC and the Ground Component Command (GCC). Certain dynamic targets may have restrictions that prevent Air Component Command assets to strike. The 3BCD, with coordination from COD in order to synchronize airspace deconfliction, can provide surface to surface fires to service these targets. In addition, they may request air effects from COD to strike ground priority targets.
Participants:

Captain Matthew Kim, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Chief, Dynamic Targeting
Major Ji Hun Yoon, Republic of Korea Air Force, ROK Chief, Dynamic Targeting

Travel pool #9 — osan air base
At roughly 1:32 PM, pool was loaded into vans at the Osan Air Base. Pool was led to the back aisles of the combat operations floor. Inside the room were rows of Korean and American troops sitting at computers showing word documents and aerial surveillance footage.
Large screens at the front of the operations floor showed black and white aerial surveillance footage, maps and what appeared to be a spreadsheet of data. The screen in the middle displayed Korean and American flags.
President Biden and President Yoon entered at 1:52 PM. One serviceman began describing the functions of the operations center although most of his comments were hard to hear.
At one point, the president asked a question but it was inaudible.
"The best thing I can do to describe what we do here is we convert your words into action," the military official told Biden.
The president then moved to the left of the room to give remarks. He opened with a joke.
"First of all I want to say thank you and I wish you'd work on your biceps more," he said to the serviceman sitting just in front of him. He noted the airman's bicep was larger than his thigh. He reminded the serviceman he used to be an athlete.
"Our alliance is formed through shared sacrifices of the Korean War and several decades later thanks to you the Republic of Korea is a strong thriving democracy," Biden said.
POTUS at one point slowed down to allow his translator to catch up.
"All the American troops that are here and your families, thank you for what you do for our country and our allies," he said.
As he paused to allow the translator to interpret, Biden winked at the airmen and airwomen. "And to the Korean forces thank you as well."
"I won't attempt Korean but… We go together," Biden said, reciting the mantra of the servicemen at the military site. "And by the way, we go together," Biden said, extending his hand to Yoon.
Yoon continued clapping, not initially realizing Biden's hand. The president kept his hand extended. They then shook hands.
Yoon then spoke, saying he was grateful for "the airmen and airwoman." He also mentioned the threat of North Korea but he said he was reassured by the support of the United States.
"The importance of your role and responsibility to defend this peninsula," Yoon said. "I feel reassured seeing you today as the center of our defense."
Pool was rushed out at 2:10 PM. We arrived at the bowling alley on the airbase at 2:28. More TK
We're rolling to bowling at 2:25z

Travel pool #10 — osan air base
Shortly after 2:30 President Biden entered a cafeteria in the bowling alley to meet mostly uniformed troops and some family members. Cafeteria included posters of Johnny cash and Elvis. No one was masked.
Biden walked in wearing a black cap. One White House official said it was labeled US-PK and a gift from commander of the base.
Biden went straight for the ice cream and picked up a small cup of chocolate chip ice cream. There was a banner behind the ice cream stand reading, "especially for you."
Pool asked to get closer and was told "no, sorry."
Biden went straight to the tables with children. He spent several seconds writing a note to one girl. As he visited servicemen he took his cap off. He then went back for a second serving of ice cream, this time getting vanilla and chocolate, according to the ice cream server.
He then took a selfie with a number of children. Biden multitasked talking with the young family members with taking bites of ice cream.
He went to sit at another table and could be heard asking some of the children their ages. "Are you kidding me?" he replied to one. Another girl raised her hand to show she was five.
He padded the shoulder of another woman at the table and said something inaudible. Pool was rushed out at 2:45 PM to the bowling alley. One pooler asked a White House official to stay in the cafeteria but was denied. At 2:55, Biden entered the bowling alley. The pool was positioned to the side of the bowling lane on the far left. A group of children bowling did not appear to notice the president about 15 feet behind them taking pictures with troops. His black cap was back. Avicii was playing.
Biden then walked to the lane in front of us and posed for photographs with the children. "Happy," by Pharrell played.
Pooler could hear the president say "thanks, man," to one boy after a group photograph. At 3:07 PM, pool was rushed out and led to the vans. Your pooler got a glimpse of POTUS turning his back to apparently leave as we exited.
Pool could not see POTUS entering the motorcade. We're rolling to Air Force One at 3:18 PM. (Sorry for the loose notes at the bottom of the last pool report).
And special thanks to Alex Thompson for hustling to get details, including the flavor of the president's ice cream.

Travel pool report # 11 Biden gaggle
Before boarding Air Force one biden was asked about monkeypox.
"They haven't told me the level of exposure yet but it is something that everybody should be concerned about," Biden said "we're working on it hard to figure out what we do and what vaccine if any might be available for it. It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential. That's all they told me."
Biden said he's looking forward to seeing the winner of the Australia election and "quad matters." He pumped his fist. He also said goodbye to advance staff and posed for a photo.
We're off to Tokyo.

Travel pool report # 12 correction / AF1 gaggle
Apologies. Your pooler meant to write monkeypox not "monkey paws" in the last pool report. I blame autocorrect but you can blame me.
AF1 landed at 5:04 PM. While in the air national security adviser Jake Sullivan gaggled. You can find the audio at White House live.
He was asked about on IPEF, Taiwan, Biden meeting with Modi and human rights abuses in India. He also said Biden would meet with the newly elected prime minister of Australia. He was asked about the US approach to North Korea and John Kirby's new role.
He said US intelligence still says North Korea could do a nuclear or missile test.
He was asked about the economic framework for this region would benefit Americans feeling the pain of inflation.
Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also summarized the latest efforts on the baby formula shortage (she could not give a timeline on when parents can readily get baby formula). She was also asked about the administration not seeking a stay on title 42.
Also here's some background from the Hyundai announcement earlier:
Creating a Domestic Electric Vehicle (EV) Industry
The President's commitment to the electrification of the transportation sector, particularly on-road vehicles, has spurred a renaissance in the American auto industry, and his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is now supercharging America's efforts to lead the electric future with historic investments in charging infrastructure, battery manufacturing, and clean transit. Together, the President's catalyzing actions include:

Generational Investment in Charging Infrastructure: BIL invests $7.5 billion in grants to states and project developers to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States. Federal funding will have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.


Historic Funding for Domestic Battery Supply Chain: BIL invests more than $7 billion in grants to companies to accelerate innovations and facilities across the battery supply chain, including battery material processing, manufacturing, and recycling.

To date, the President's climate leadership has spurred tens of billions in private investments across the EV supply chain, including:

General Motors announcing $8 billion in additional investment in EVs and battery manufacturing through 2025, including a $2.5 billion joint venture with Korean company LG Energy; and


Ford announcing two new large battery and electric vehicle production lines as part of $13.6 billion in EV investment, including an $11.6 billion joint venture with Korean company SK Innovation.

Hyundai Electric Vehicle Plant Announcement
Chairman Chung will announce Hyundai's $5.7 billion investment in a new EV manufacturing plant in Savannah, Georgia. This plant will produce electric vehicles across all three of its major vehicle divisions – Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis – and will include on-site battery production. In total, this plant is expected to employ 8,000 people and construction is expected to begin in January 2023 – with the first vehicle produced at the plant in January of 2026.
Hyundai Motor Company
Last month, Hyundai Motor Group announced an investment of $7.4 billion in the United States by 2025. Hyundai and Kia will both build American-made battery electric vehicles and Hyundai Motor Company's U.S. facility is slated to begin EV production in 2022. HMG will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Energy to advance the hydrogen ecosystem in the United States.
