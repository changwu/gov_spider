    Romney for President today released its eighth TV ad in Spanish since January 2012. The ad, entitled "I Invite You," features Craig Romney inviting the public to get to know his father for the person he is, a family man of strong convictions. As president, Mitt Romney will work hard to help create jobs and get our country back on track.
"We are thrilled that Craig Romney has added his voice to the chorus of voices who day in and day out bring the Governor's message of economic prosperity and opportunity to the Hispanic community en Espa√±ol. He is a tremendous asset to our efforts to energize our community, especially young Latinos," said RFP National Director of Specialty Media Valentina Weis.
The release of the ad, which will air in target markets across the country, coincided with the launch of the campaign's new Spanish-language website, www.JuntosConRomney.com.
