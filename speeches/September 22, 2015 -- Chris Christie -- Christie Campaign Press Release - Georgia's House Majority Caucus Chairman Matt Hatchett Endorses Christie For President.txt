MORRISTOWN, NJ - Today, Georgia State Representative Matt Hatchett announced his endorsement of Governor Chris Christie for President. Hatchett is a successful small business leader and a strong voice of the Republican party throughout Georgia.
"I believe Governor Christie is clearly the strongest candidate in this race to serve as our next President and to take on the Democratic nominee next year. His bold leadership style and strong conservative record stand out in a crowded field. He is also the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to address the entitlement crisis facing this country. I firmly believe Governor Christie is the best choice to move our country forward and restore sanity in Washington D.C.," said State Rep. Hatchett.
