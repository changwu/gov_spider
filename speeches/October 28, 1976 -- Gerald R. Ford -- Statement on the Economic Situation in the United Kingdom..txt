    THE UNITED States has the highest confidence in the ability of the United Kingdom to overcome its present economic difficulties. The British Government has taken a number of positive steps. We are further encouraged by Britain's decision to seek a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund. As I have already stated publicly, the United States will fully support an agreement reached between Britain and the IMF. As a matter of general policy, it is the abiding purpose of the United States to see the United Kingdom as a vigorous member of the European Community, the North Atlantic Alliance, and other international institutions whose goal it is to build a better and safer world.
