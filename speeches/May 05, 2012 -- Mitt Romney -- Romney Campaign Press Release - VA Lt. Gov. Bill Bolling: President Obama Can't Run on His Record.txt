    Virginia Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling made the following statement on President Obama's campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia:
"In 2008, candidate Barack Obama came to Virginia and promised to create jobs and fix the economy. Three and a half years later, the President has more than just rhetoric to offer – he has a record. Virginians – and all Americans – will hold President Obama accountable for his inability to create jobs, rein in spending, or offer a coherent energy policy. Mitt Romney knows that we need new ideas and a new approach to get America back on track. He has the experience and the record of achievement we need to grow our economy and strengthen America at home and abroad. That's why I'm proud to support his candidacy for president."
