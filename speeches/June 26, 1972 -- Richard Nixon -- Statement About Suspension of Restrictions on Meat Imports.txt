    TO COUNTER recent rises in the cost of meat, I have today directed the Secretary of State to remove all quota restrictions on meat imported into the United States for the balance of 1972. Nations which export meat to the United States until today have been observing voluntary quotas.
The recent rise in the price of meat is in part due to an improving economy here at home causing increased demands for meat which have not been matched by increased supplies. This action is intended to encourage more meat imports into the United States, thereby increasing the supply available here.
This action alone may not fully solve the problem. Further measures will be taken as necessary and appropriate.
I intend to monitor this situation closely, and I want to assure every American housewife that this Administration is firmly determined to prevent unjustified increases in the cost of food.
We have made significant progress in our battle against rising prices. We are going to do whatever is necessary to see that that battle is won.
Earlier this year, we announced an import program to increase meat imports 11 percent over meat imports during 1971.1 Since that time, however, the continuing shift in demand and supplies has become much more pronounced.
1 By Proclamation 4114 of March 9, 1972.
All meat imports, of course, will be subject to the same high standards of sanitation that apply to domestically produced meat.
This action is not aimed at the American farmer; his income has only begun to approach reasonable levels. It is intended to remedy a short-term shortage which is beyond the ability of our farmers to fill.
