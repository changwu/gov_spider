    Celebrated prolife and veterans ads to begin airing today in the Palmetto State
LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that it will begin airing its celebrated prolife and veterans ads — 'Staying on the Right Path' and 'He Served' — in the key early voting state of South Carolina.
The ads feature some of Ron Paul's patients attesting to his character, professionalism, and prolife credentials and his longstanding devotion to veterans' issues, respectively.
The ad buy is in the six-figure dollar range and begins today on broadcast and cable television.
"Airing the well-received ads 'Staying on the Right Path' and 'He Served' will bring Ron Paul's impeccable record on the sanctity of life — at all stages of life, including at the conclusion of one's service to the nation — to key early state voters," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"South Carolina voters are receptive to Ron Paul's message that life is precious and military service is honorable, all in the context of his overall philosophy of a return to personal and economic liberty," said Mr. Benton.
