    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Metzenbaum (D) OH and 35 others)
The Administration opposes S. 79, which would unnecessarily duplicate current Federal efforts regarding the evaluation and notification of workers of hazards in the workplace. S. 79 is likely to result in substantial litigation and in massive Federal and private sector tort liability. This legislation would impose enormous costs on employers, consumers, workers, and the Federal Government. If S. 79 were presented to the President, the President's senior advisors would recommend disapproval.
However, if Congress believes legislation in this area is necessary, the Administration could accept a substitute that would emphasize prevention of disease, build on existing Federal programs, and avoid many of the litigation and liability implications, as well as practical difficulties, inherent in the broad individual risk notification approach envisioned in S. 79. This approach was incorporated in H.R. 3566, the alternative proposed by Representatives Jeffords and Henry.
