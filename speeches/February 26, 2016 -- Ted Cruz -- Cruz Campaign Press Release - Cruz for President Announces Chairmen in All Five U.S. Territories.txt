    HOUSTON, Texas — Today Cruz for President announced its campaign chairmen in each of the five U.S. territories, which for purposes of the Republican presidential nomination are equal with the 50 states and District of Columbia. The chairmen are Governor Eddie Calvo (Guam), attorney Antonio Hernandez (Puerto Rico), attorney Steven Pixley (Northern Mariana Islands), former Ron Paul Chairman Max Schanfarber (Virgin Islands), and accountant Charles Warren (American Samoa).
"I am proud to have a strong team assembled across the entire United States, including the five territories that will play a critical role in selecting the Republican nominee," said presidential candidate Ted Cruz. "We are committed to winning the long game, which can only be done by having campaign operations in every part of our country." Under RNC Rule 40-b, a candidate must have a majority of delegates in eight states or territories to be eligible for nomination at the convention in Cleveland.
Each territory has equal weight with the 50 states and the District of Columbia in placing the name of a candidate into nomination.
