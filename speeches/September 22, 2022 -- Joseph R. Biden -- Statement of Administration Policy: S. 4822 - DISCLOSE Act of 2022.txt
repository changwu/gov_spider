    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Whitehouse, D-RI, and 49 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 4822, the DISCLOSE Act of 2022, a vital bill to restore the integrity of our elections.
Our current campaign finance system allows anonymous special interests to hide in the shadows when spending unlimited sums of money to influence our elections, leaving Americans skeptical about whether their elected representatives are actually working for them. Under our current system, it is too easy for foreign money to influence our elections.
The DISCLOSE Act would, among other reforms, close loopholes that allow foreign money to seep into elections and require organizations spending money in elections to be more transparent. It would help to ensure that government of the American people by the American people is also for the American people. This legislation is needed to restore confidence in our government and in our democratic institutions.
As the bill moves forward, the Administration will continue to work with Congress to ensure that it achieves lasting reform consistent with Congress' broad constitutional authority to strengthen our democracy.
