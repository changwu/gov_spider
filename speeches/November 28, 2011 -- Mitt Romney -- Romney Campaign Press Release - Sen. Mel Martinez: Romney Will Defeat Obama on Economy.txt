    Former Florida Senator and Romney for President National Advisory Council Chairman Mel Martinez made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"It is unsurprising that President Obama and the Democratic Party machine are relentlessly attacking Mitt Romney. Having failed to turn around the economy, they have no choice but to run a negative campaign against the presidential candidate best equipped to bring them to account for three years of economic mismanagement that has left millions of Americans without work."
