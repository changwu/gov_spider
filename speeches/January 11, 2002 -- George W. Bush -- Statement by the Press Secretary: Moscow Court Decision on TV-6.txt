    The Administration was disappointed this morning to learn that the Supreme Arbitration Court Presidium in Moscow today decided to go forward with the liquidation of one of Moscows most popular TV stations, TV-6.
It is unfortunate that there has been the strong appearance of political pressure on the courts during these proceedings. Development of a free media and steady, consistent movement toward the rule of law are critical elements in Russias transformation into a democratic, free market and increasingly prosperous nation.
