    The TSA "gropes and grabs our children, our seniors, and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities...while doing nothing to keep us safe."
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign released the following statement concerning TSA abuses like the ones that resulted in U.S. Sen. Rand Paul being inconvenienced at the Nashville, Tennessee airport. Below please find comments from Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX):
"The police state in this country is growing out of control. One of the ultimate embodiments of this is the TSA that gropes and grabs our children, our seniors, and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities. The TSA does all of this while doing nothing to keep us safe.
"That is why my 'Plan to Restore America,' in additional to cutting $1 trillion dollars in federal spending in one year, eliminates the TSA.
"We must restore the freedom and respect for liberty that once made American the greatest nation in human history. I am deeply committed to doing that as President of the United States."
