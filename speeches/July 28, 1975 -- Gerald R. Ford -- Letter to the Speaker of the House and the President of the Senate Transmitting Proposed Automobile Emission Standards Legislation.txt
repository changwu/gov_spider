    [Dated July 26, 1975. Released July 28, 1975]
ON JUNE 27, 1975, I transmitted a special message to the Congress which described the complex problem of setting automobile emission standards which strike the best possible balance among our air quality, public health, energy, consumer cost and other economic objectives.
As indicated in that message, I have concluded that automobile emission standards should not be more rigid than those applied to 1975 and 1976 model cars because more rigid standards unnecessarily would increase car prices, reduce gasoline mileage, and increase energy demands. There is also the potential that tighter standards would require emission controls that result in new pollutants with serious health impact.
I am enclosing a draft of a bill which would implement the recommendations described in detail in my June 27th message. I urge prompt passage of this bill.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
