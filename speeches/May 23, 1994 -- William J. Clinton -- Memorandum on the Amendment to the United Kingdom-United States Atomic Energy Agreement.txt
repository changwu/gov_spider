    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy 
Subject: Proposed Amendment to the United States/United Kingdom Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes
I have reviewed and concur in the positions taken in your joint letter to me of May 14, 1994, recommending approval of a proposed amendment to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes. I note from your joint recommendation and concur with your view that the United Kingdom is participating with the United States pursuant to an international agreement by substantial and material contributions to the mutual defense and security. The proposed Amendment will permit cooperation that will further improve our mutual defense posture and support our interests under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I hereby:
—approve the proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement;
—determine that performance under the proposed Amendment will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security;
—approve the program outlined in this Amendment and determine that such program will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security; and
—authorize the execution of the proposed Amendment for the Government of the United States in a manner specified by the Secretary of State.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
