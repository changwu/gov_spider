The Administration supports the policy objectives of H.R. 3674.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3674 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that H.R. 3674 would reduce direct spending by $26 million in FY 1997 and by a total of $58 million during FYs 1997 through 2002.
