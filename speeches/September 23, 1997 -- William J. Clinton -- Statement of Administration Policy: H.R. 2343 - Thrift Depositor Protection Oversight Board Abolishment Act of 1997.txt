    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Leach (R) Iowa and Vento (D) MN)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2343, which is based on an Administration proposal. The Oversight Board, like the Resolution Trust Corporation, has accomplished its mission and is no longer necessary. Abolishing the Board would streamline Federal government operations and save an estimated $250,000 in personnel and related costs annually.
