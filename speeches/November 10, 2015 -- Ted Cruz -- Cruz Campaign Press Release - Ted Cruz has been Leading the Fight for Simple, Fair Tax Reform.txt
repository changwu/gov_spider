    MILWAUKEE, WI â€” Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz rolled out his Simple, Flat Tax Plan in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed. The Simple Flat Tax will effectively abolish the IRS and dismantle the Washington Cartel. Under Ted Cruz's Simple Flat Tax, Americans in all income brackets will see double-digit after-tax wage growth, and giant corporations will be unable to use loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
The Simple Flat Tax keeps Cruz's promise to Abolish the IRS and dismantle the Washington Cartel that uses our complex tax code as a political weapon. It levels the playing field for businesses. No longer will giant corporations be able to avoid paying what they owe while small businesses and hard-working Americans pick up the tab. The Cruz plan allows every American to do their own taxes in a matter of minutes and allows families to save up to $25,000 per year completely tax-free, until they decide to spend it, how they want to spend it. The Tax Foundation has evaluated it and said that all Americans will see their incomes increase by at least 14 percent, maybe more. It will eliminate six taxes including the death tax, the payroll tax, the alternative minimum tax, and every last unconstitutional and unconscionable tax found in Obamacare.
