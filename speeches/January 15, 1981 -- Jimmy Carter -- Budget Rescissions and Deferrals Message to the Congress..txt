    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose 33 new rescissions of budget authority previously provided by the Congress, totalling $1,142.4 million. In addition, I am reporting 15 new deferrals totalling $1,429.9 million and revisions to three previously-reported deferrals totalling $4.4 million.
The rescission proposals affect programs of the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development as well as the Community Services Administration, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the Federal payment to the Postal Service Fund, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The deferrals affect programs of the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Interior, Justice, Labor, and State, as well as the intelligence community staff, the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, and the Small Business Administration.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
