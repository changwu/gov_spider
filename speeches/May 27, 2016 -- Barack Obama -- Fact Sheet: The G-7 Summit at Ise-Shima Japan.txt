To this end, G-7 leaders asked the World Bank to develop a global crisis response platform that will assist host states in providing sustainable livelihoods and education for both refugee populations and their communities. The platform will help advance the objectives of the President's Summit on Refugees that will be held on the margins of the UN General Assembly in September.
Achieving Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Global Economic Growth
While U.S. businesses have added 14.6 million jobs over a record 74 consecutive months of job growth, global economic growth remains moderate and uneven.

G-7 leaders called on their respective policy experts to coordinate actions, working with other countries affected by this issue.

Leaders pledged additional support to the Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund to help transition away from HFCs.
• Addressing Short-Lived Climate Pollutants: G-7 leaders recognized the importance of mitigating emissions from other short-lived climate pollutants like methane and black carbon, and resolved to drive down methane emissions.

Leaders also affirmed their strong commitment to the timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda adopted at the 2015 Financing for Development conference, which represents a consensus that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will require unlocking three streams of financing: the mobilization of domestic resources; private sector investments; and official development assistance and other international public finance flows. Leaders reaffirmed the essential role that official development assistance and international public finance play as catalysts for, and complements to, other sources of financing for development. To that end, the United States is a founding member of the Addis Tax Initiative. As part of this collective effort, the United States has committed to significantly increase its technical assistance for tax and fiscal management capacity building in developing countries, in order to help strengthen developing countries' capacity to mobilize and effectively use domestic resources to achieve the SDGs and finance their own development. G-7 leaders noted their commitment to the principles outlined in the Addis Tax Initiative.
