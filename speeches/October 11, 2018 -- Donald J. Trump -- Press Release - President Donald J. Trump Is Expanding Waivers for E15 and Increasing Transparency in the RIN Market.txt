    We want to eliminate the intrusive rules that undermine your ability to earn a living, and we will protect the corn-based ethanol and biofuels that power our country.President Donald J. Trump
EXPANDING WAIVERS FOR E15: The Trump Administration is initiating rulemaking to expand fuel waivers for E15, or gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol. 

President Donald J. Trump is directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to initiate a rulemaking to consider expanding Reid Vapor Pressure waivers for fuel blends containing gasoline and up to 15 percent ethanol.

Under the proposed expansion, E15 would be allowed to be sold year round rather than just eight months of the year.


President Trump continues to uphold his commitment to ethanol and the Renewable Fuel Standard program to give consumers more choice.
The proposed expansion will strengthen America's domestic energy production and provide a boost to America's famers.

INCREASING TRANSPARENCY IN THE RIN MARKET: In the same rulemaking, the Trump Administration will increase transparency in the Renewable Identification Number (RIN) market.

In the same rulemaking, President Trump is directing the EPA to consider reforms to increase transparency and prevent price manipulation in the RIN market.
These potential reforms to be considered include:

Prohibiting entities other than obligated parties from purchasing separated RINs.
Requiring public disclosure when RIN holdings held by an individual actor exceed specified limits.
Limiting the length of time a non-obligated party can hold RINs.
Requiring the retirement of RINs for the purpose of compliance be made in real time.


President Trump and his Administration held meetings with various stakeholders, including Members of Congress and State leaders, to hear a range of views while evaluating this decision.
These proposals will go through the formal notice and public comment process.
