    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gephardt (D) Missouri)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3400 and strongly supports the Sabo amendment as made in order by the rule.
H.R. 3400 is largely based upon recommendations made by the National Performance Review (NPR) led by Vice President Gore. It represents an important step toward the goals of the NPR -- a more effective, efficient, and responsive government.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that H.R. 3400, as amended by the Sabo amendment, would yield savings of $37.1 billion over 5 years.
The Administration appreciates the House's prompt response to its rescission proposals and is pleased with the level of savings from the rescissions contained in the Sabo amendment.
Penny-Kasich Amendment
The Administration's strong opposition to the Penny-Kasich amendment is explained in the attached letter from the President.
