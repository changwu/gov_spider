    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense 
Subject: Assessment of Space Launch Vehicles
Our national space transportation capabilities are critical to the overall strength and stability of our commercial, civil, and national security space sectors.
As we enter the 21st century, reliable access to space will be more important than ever in accomplishing our national goals. It is vitally important that we fully understand the root causes behind the recent launch vehicle failures and take corrective action. Therefore, I request that you, in coordination with the Director of Central Intelligence and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), provide me with an interim report in 90 days and a final report in 180 days on the causes of these failures and actions required to ensure our future access to space.
I have asked Dr. Neal Lane, my Assistant for Science and Technology, to work closely with you, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Administrator of NASA on this important issue.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
