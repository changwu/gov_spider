    Dear Mort:
It was with deep personal regret that I learned of your decision to return to your duties at the United States Information Agency. I am, however, deeply grateful for your service on the White House staff and I take satisfaction in knowing that your service to our country will continue as you accept a new assignment overseas.
Throughout your career, and especially here at the White House, you have served with dedication and distinction and with a truly inspirational sense of public duty. I know well of the many long hours you have devoted and of your tireless efforts to serve many constituencies. And through it all, you have maintained the highest standards of personal integrity and loyalty and you have even maintained a sense of humor. I am proud to have had you as my Deputy Press Secretary and I am proud to have you as one of our nation's representatives abroad.
Nancy joins me in wishing you, Mary Ann, Stephanie and Lyndon all of life's blessings.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Lyndon K. Allin, Deputy Press Secretary to the President, The White House,
Washington, D.C. 20500]
