    President's Vacation
Q. Relaxing a bit?
The President. What?
Q. You've got your shirt off.
The President. If you sweated through your shirt as much as I've sweated through mine, it would be off too.
Iraq
Q. Can we ask about Iraq for a second?
The President. No. You heard what I said in there. I'm a patient man. I'll use all the tools at our disposal. Nothing's changed.
