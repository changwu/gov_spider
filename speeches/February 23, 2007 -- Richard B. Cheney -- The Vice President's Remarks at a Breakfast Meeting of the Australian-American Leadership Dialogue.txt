THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm delighted to be back. We've tried a number of times, scheduled return visits when I've been Vice President, but business has been such that we haven't gotten here -- this time.
But I'm just reminiscing today, looking down on the harbor one of my prior trips was the 50th anniversary of the Coral Sea Anniversary, I guess, the Coral Sea Celebration must have been '92. And we brought the Independence, the aircraft carrier and the entire battle group from Japan down and had a week-long celebration. It was a great trip. I periodically run into people who still remember it in person. It was fun to come back and reminisce on that.
Obviously, there's great work to be done. And we're doing a lot of it. We'll talk about that later this morning.
