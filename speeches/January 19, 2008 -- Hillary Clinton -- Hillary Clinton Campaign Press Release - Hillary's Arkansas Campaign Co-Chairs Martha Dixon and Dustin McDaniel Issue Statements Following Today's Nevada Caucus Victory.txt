    On the heels of a solid win for Hillary in Nevada, Hillary's Arkansas Campaign Co-Chairs Martha Dixon and Dustin McDaniel issued the following statements.
"Hillary's message of change and experience resonated with Nevada caucus goers today just like it resonates with those of us here in Arkansas," said Dixon. "We are thrilled about Hillary's victory in Nevada today, but are not taking anything for granted here in Arkansas. Hillary's campaign will continue to run an aggressive, grassroots operation leading up to the February 5th primary.
Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, Hillary's other co-chair in Arkansas, added that he believes Arkansas voters will continue to build on Hillary's momentum here in Arkansas.
"The voters of Nevada sent out a strong message today that they believe in Hillary Clinton's plan for universal health care, a real plan to get our economy back on track, and experienced leadership that will bring about the real change Arkansas families are looking for," McDaniel said. "I think Arkansas voters will take their passion for Hillary's principles and speak very loudly on February 5."
