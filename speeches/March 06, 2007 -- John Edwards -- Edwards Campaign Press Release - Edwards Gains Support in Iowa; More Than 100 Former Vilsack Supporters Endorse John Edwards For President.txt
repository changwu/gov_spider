    Des Moines, Iowa â€” Building on an already strong base of support in Iowa, the John Edwards for President campaign announced today that more than 100 Iowa Democrats who were formerly supporting Governor Tom Vilsack's presidential bid are now supporting Senator John Edwards for President.
"Tom Vilsack is one of the great leaders of Iowa and a powerful voice for all working Americans," said Edwards. "I am honored to have so many of his supporters join my campaign, and I look forward to working with them to build an America where every person has the chance to succeed."
Democrats throughout Iowa continue to join Edwards' grassroots campaign to transform America. Among the former Vilsack supporters endorsing Edwards are State Representative Kurt Swaim and prominent attorney and Democratic activist Ed Skinner.
"John Edwards is a good friend to Iowa," said Swaim. "He knows the people of Iowa and the issues that are important to us. I proudly support his campaign for President. With his leadership, we can get America back on the right path."
"John Edwards is exactly the kind of leader we need here in Iowa and in our country," said Skinner. "He has always stood by working Americans and fought to end injustice in our nation. With his leadership, we can build one America, where every person has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream."
