After the Nevada caucus, Hillary Clinton had a message for the countless Americans who are working alongside her: This campaign is about YOU.


  " Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other. And this one's for you."

"You turned out in every corner of this state, with determination and purpose."


"Hotel and casino workers who never wavered."


"Students with too much debt and small-business owners who never go off the clock."


"Tens of thousands of men and women with kids to raise, bills to pay, and dreams that won't die."



"To the thousands of volunteers and organizers who worked so hard in this state ..."


"... and to the millions of people across our country who are supporting our campaignâ€”thank you from the bottom of my heart."


"We're in this together. We look at our country and see so much that isn't working the way it should."


"Worst of all, we see children growing up in poverty or pain or fear. Here in Nevada, a brave young girl told me how scared she is that her parents could be deported."


"I met kids trying to learn in crumbling classrooms in neglected communities."


"Then there's Flint, Michigan, where children were poisoned by toxic water just because their governor wanted to save a little money."


"Every one of us has a role to play in building the future we want."



  " America can only live up to its potential when each and every American has the chance to live up to your potential, too. "

If you're with Hillary, let her know.?
