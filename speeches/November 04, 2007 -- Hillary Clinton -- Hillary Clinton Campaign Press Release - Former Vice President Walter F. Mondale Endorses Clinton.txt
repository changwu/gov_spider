    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale.
"America is ready for change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Mondale said. "Hillary is uniquely qualified to rebuild America's standing in the world and lead this nation from her first day in the White House."
Mondale served as Vice President from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter, and was the Democratic nominee for President in 1984.
His career in public service began in 1960 when he was appointed Attorney General of Minnesota, later rising to become a two-term U.S. Senator. From 1986 to 1993, Mondale was chairman of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, then served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996.
Mondale is currently Senior Counsel at the law firm of Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis, MN.
"Throughout his distinguished career in public service, Walter has been a champion for working families and equality for all Americans," Clinton said. "I am deeply honored to have his support and delighted that he'll join our effort to change America."
