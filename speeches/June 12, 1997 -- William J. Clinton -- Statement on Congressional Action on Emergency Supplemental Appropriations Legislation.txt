    I applaud the United States Congress for passing the disaster relief bill that the families of the Midwest and other parts of the country desperately need. I am especially pleased that the congressional majority heeded the call of common sense by ensuring that the people who need this assistance will get it and by ensuring that the controversial and extraneous provisions of the bill were dropped. Anyone who has toured the flood-ravaged areas of the Midwest, as I have, knows that these needed funds will help put America's families and communities on the road to recovery. Above all, today's vote shows that while we may not agree on everything, we can still work together and move forward on those crucial priorities that are beyond dispute. I thank the Congress for its willingness to do so, and I hope we can continue to work together in that spirit in the weeks and months to come.
