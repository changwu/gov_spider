    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former St. Petersburg, Florida Mayor Rick Baker. Baker will serve as a Senior Adviser on Urban Policy for the National Campaign.
 
"Rick Baker has been a successful mayor and a strong advocate for fiscally conservative principles," said Mitt Romney. "Rick understands that in order to turn around our economy and create jobs we need to cut government regulations, reduce spending and lower taxes. I am proud to have his support and gratified that he has decided to join my campaign to undo the damage caused by President Obama's reckless fiscal policies."
Announcing his support, former Mayor Baker said, "Mitt Romney is the strongest Republican candidate and he is the only person capable of defeating Barack Obama in 2012. Mitt Romney has the experience, the vision and the commitment to conservative values that our Republican nominee will need to draw bold contrasts with the President's failed, big government agenda. It is an honor to join his team and I look forward to working to ensure that he is elected the next President of the United States."
