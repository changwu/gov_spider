    SPRINGFIELD, Mo. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday issued the following statement on comments by Hillary Clinton on a proposed job-killing trade agreement with Pacific Rim nations:
"I hear Secretary Clinton is in Ohio tonight talking about how concerned she is about the auto industry – an industry decimated by the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalized trade with China. She supported those bad deals. I opposed them.
"Now she says she wants to make it tougher for automobiles to be imported to this country under the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's the deal she called the 'gold standard' when she was Secretary of State.
"Well, I have a message for Secretary Clinton: We shouldn't re-negotiate the Pacific trade proposal. We should kill this unfettered free-trade agreement which would cost us nearly half a million jobs.
"We don't need to tinker with this agreement. We need to defeat it. We need an entirely new trade policy that creates jobs in this country, not more low-wage jobs abroad."
