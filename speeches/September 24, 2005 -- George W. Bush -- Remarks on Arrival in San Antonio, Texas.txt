    The President. Mr. Mayor, thanks—[inaudible]—and the Judge. It's good to see you all, thanks. It's good to be back in San Antonio.
The country and the world has seen the great compassion of the Texas people after Hurricane Katrina. Over 300,000 people moved east to west, and they found home here in Texas. And the city of San Antonio, Mr. Mayor, and Judge, was—really rose up with great compassion. And I cannot thank you enough and the people of this city enough, for providing safe haven for people whose lives were turned upside down by this horrific storm. And it made me so proud to be from the State of Texas, to see the Texans rise to the occasion.
Again, I want to thank you, Mayor, and thank all the——
Mayor Phil Hardberger. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. ——houses of worship and community groups and individuals who love their neighbor like they'd like to be loved themselves.
We're now dealing with another storm, and the State of Texas is prepared for and is now responding to the storm that's affecting east Texas. I briefed today up in Colorado about the Federal Government's response to the storm and then went to Austin to be briefed by the State officials, to make sure that we're working in concert with the State. And then tomorrow morning General Clark is going to come over and brief me once again about how the Federal Government is helping the State of Texas and Louisiana recover.
But at any rate, it's good to be back here. I'm proud of my fellow Texans, and I'm proud of the people of the San Antonio.
Mayor Hardberger. Well, we're mighty glad to have you here, Mr. President. Thank you for being with us.
The President. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you all.
