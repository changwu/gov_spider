    McLean, VA - Senator Fred Thompson issued the following statement regarding today's scientific breakthrough in adult cell research:
"There is exciting news for patients today. In yet another breakthrough for adult cell research, scientists have made normal human skin cells take on the relevant properties of embryonic stem cells. That is in addition to 73 breakthroughs for adult and cord blood research to date. There are still no embryonic stem cell breakthroughs.
"For all who are concerned for patients and their families, the effective, ethical, and compassionate answer is to put our money where the breakthroughs are happening -- in adult research.
"Using adult cells negates the need for cloning embryos to harvest their stem cells.
"We all want to find cures to help people with chronic illnesses. Adult cells have provided breakthroughs for many illnesses including ovarian and breast cancer, Juvenile Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, and Sickle Cell Anemia. Today's announcement is just one more indication that our current policy in relying only on adult cells is working."
