    Verona, PA - Today on NBC's Meet the Press, Republican Presidential hopeful Herman Cain stated that he "wouldn't seek a constitutional ban for same sex marriage" and that state "would make up their own minds."
In response, Senator Santorum said, "I have been a long-time advocate for states' rights. However, I believe as Abraham Lincoln did - that states don't have the rights to legalize moral wrongs. Mr. Cain, Congresswoman Bachmann and Governor Perry all believe 50 different definitions of marriage is fine, I strongly disagree and will continue fighting for traditional marriage between one man and woman."
Hogan Gidley, National Communication Director, said: "First Herman Cain supported TARP, then he pushed a new 9 percent nationwide tax on top of income taxes, and now he's supporting the redefinition of marriage at the state level. The more they learn, the more concerned conservatives become."
Senator Santorum is one of the original sponsors of the Federal Marriage Amendment and the nation's leading advocate for the traditional American family. As a presidential candidate, Senator Santorum proudly signed the National Organization for Marriage's "Pro-Marriage Pledge," which Mr. Cain refused to sign. Last fall, Senator Santorum was the only 2012 presidential contender to travel to Iowa and campaign in opposition to Iowa State Supreme Court Justices who decided to take it upon themselves to redefine marriage.
