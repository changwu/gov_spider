    AS OUR fellow Americans of the Islamic faith look forward to the celebration of the special feast days at the end of Ramadan, Mrs. Ford and I express our greetings and best wishes to each of you.
For you it is a time of renewal and remembrance. It is an opportunity to rededicate yourselves to your religious heritage and to its timeless principles.
For all your fellow Americans it is a chance to reflect with pride and admiration on the way in which the Islamic heritage enriches all of us.
Mrs. Ford and I hope that this year's holidays will be especially satisfying and happy ones for each of you.
