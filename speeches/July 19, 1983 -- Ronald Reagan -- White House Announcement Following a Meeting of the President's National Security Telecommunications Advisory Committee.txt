    The second meeting of the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) was held on July 19-20, 1983, at the Headquarters of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebr.
All 29 NSTAC members are senior executives of major U.S. corporations in the telecommunications industry. During its business session, NSTAC finalized and voted to send recommendations to the President addressing enhancements in telecommunications capabilities to support national security requirements. Those recommendations will now be reviewed by the Secretary of Defense. That review is expected to be completed this summer with the President reviewing and acting upon NSTAC recommendations thereafter.
During the meeting, President Reagan, who addressed the members via videotape, expressed his appreciation for the efforts of NSTAC members and the substantial commitment of corporate resources each had made to the NSTAC process.
