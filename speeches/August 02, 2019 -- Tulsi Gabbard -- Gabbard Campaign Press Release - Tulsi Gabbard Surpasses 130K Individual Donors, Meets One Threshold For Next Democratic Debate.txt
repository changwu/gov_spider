    DETROIT, Mich. — Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's campaign for President announced today that it has burst through the threshold of 130,000 unique donors, with over 400 donors in at least 20 states, required to participate in the Democratic debates. Gabbard's underdog campaign is building momentum and attracting supporters across the country.
"People are sick and tired of self-serving politicians and corporate interests exploiting them for their own selfish gain. I love our country, and I love the American people. They are why I'm in this fight. I'm grateful for the support our campaign is earning from individuals all across the country who believe in my leadership, bringing a soldier's values of service above self to the White House, putting the wellbeing of our people and our country above all else."
The Congresswoman's campaign has been gaining momentum as voters learn more about her record serving as a soldier for over 16 years, deploying twice to the Middle East, and serving in Congress for over 6 years focused on national security with seats on the Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Homeland Security committees. 
Just as in her first debate, she was once again the most Googled candidate of the night.
"Our campaign is powered by the people — not PACs or lobbyists. I will lead a government of, by, and for the people — fighting for liberty and justice for all, regardless of race or religion, as we strive towards a more perfect union."
Democratic primary candidates are required to meet both a polling and donor threshold to appear in a series of nationally televised debates. Eligibility for a debate scheduled for September requires all candidates to achieve polling of at least 2 percent in four DNC-approved polls and at least 130,000 unique donors, coming from at least 400 unique donors in 20 or more states. The deadline to meet these qualifications is August 28.
