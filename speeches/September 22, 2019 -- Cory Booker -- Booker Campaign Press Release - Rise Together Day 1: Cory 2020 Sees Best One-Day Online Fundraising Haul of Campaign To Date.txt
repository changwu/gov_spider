    Cory 2020 is nearly 18% toward $1.7 million goal after Day 1 of critical 10 day period
Raises $300,000+ in one day after warning that if fundraising trajectory doesn't change by Sept. 30, campaign will not be able to build organization necessary to win
Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 saw its best single-day online fundraising haul after alerting supporters in an urgent memo on Saturday morning that the campaign did not see a legitimate long-term path forward in the presidential race without a fundraising surge before September 30th.
"The stakes couldn't be higher for the future of our campaign, and we're absolutely blown away by the response on day one," said Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie. "People really stepped up and responded -- clearly there is a desire to keep Cory in this race and help us build our organization in a way that puts us on a path to win the nomination.
"We made significant progress toward our $1.7 million goal yesterday -- it was the best single online fundraising day of our campaign, bigger than even the launch of this campaign on February 1. There's a long way to go but today showed us that, when we come together, we can tackle tough challenges. That's how we'll win this primary, that's how we'll beat Donald Trump, and that's how we'll change this country and change the world"
