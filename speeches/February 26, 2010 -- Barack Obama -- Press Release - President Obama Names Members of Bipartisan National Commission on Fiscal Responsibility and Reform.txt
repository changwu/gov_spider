The bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform will make recommendations to Congress by December 1, 2010 to put the budget in primary balance so that all operations and programs for the federal government are paid for (achieving deficits of about 3 percent of GDP) by 2015 and to meaningfully improve the long-term fiscal outlook. With today's appointments the President has named 6 bipartisan appointees to the commission. The remaining 12 members of the commission will be appointed by Senate and House leaders (3 each by the Republican and Democratic leaders of both chambers).
