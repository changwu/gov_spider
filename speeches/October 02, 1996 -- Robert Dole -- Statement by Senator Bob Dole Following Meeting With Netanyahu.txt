    Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole today released the following statement:
"I am pleased to have had this opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the summit meetings held at the White House and about the crisis in Israel, which is of great concern to many Americans. I reminded the Prime Minister of the deep respect Americans have for his country) and emphasized our shared belief that violence is not an acceptable means of resolving differences. Violence must not be rewarded. Therefore, the most important objective at the present time is to end the violence -- unconditionally. I was disappointed that President Clinton's statement did not include an unequivocal condemnation of the recent violence. Of course, Israel and Palestinians will continue to negotiate -- as they must. As the Washington Summit demonstrated, the United States cannot impose a solution. However, we can stand clearly in support of peaceful resolution of differences between the Israelis and the Palestinians and a truly just peace."
--Bob Dole
