    The United States commends the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on their successful completion of presidential run-off and provincial elections yesterday. We welcome the presidential candidates' joint appeal to their supporters to refrain from any acts of violence. We also welcome their joint declaration to respect the electoral results. This leadership will help to ensure that the Congolese people know peace, stability, and democracy. The United States is committed to the success of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to working with the Congolese people to build a prosperous democracy.
