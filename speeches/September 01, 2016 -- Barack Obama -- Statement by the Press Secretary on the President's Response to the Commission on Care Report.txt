    Today, consistent with the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, the President's formal response to the Commission on Care was transmitted to Congress. As the President has said, a sacred covenant exists between veterans and this nation: servicemen and servicewomen take an oath to protect our country, and in turn, our nation pledges to take care of them when they leave the service. The Commission's work to evaluate the Veterans Affairs health care system is important in ensuring we keep our promise to our veterans. This Administration will continue working with members of Congress, veterans and the advocacy community to support the ongoing transformation of the VA so that all veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned.
