    The President will meet with the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schroeder, on Tuesday, October 9, 2001. Germany has offered strong political and material support for our common struggle against terrorists and those who harbor them, and Chancellor Schroeder has been unstinting in his personal leadership. The President welcomes him to Washington for this visit to discuss the road ahead in this common task, and to express his thanks to the Chancellor and the German people for the outpouring of sympathy and solidarity they have shown since September 11.
