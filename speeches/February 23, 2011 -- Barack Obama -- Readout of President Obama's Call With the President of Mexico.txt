    President Obama spoke with President Felipe Calderon Hinojosa this evening and thanked him for Mexican efforts to bring to justice the murderers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jaime Zapata, including the arrest today of one of his alleged killers.
The President said neither the United States nor Mexico could tolerate violence against those who serve and protect our citizens, as Special Agent Zapata did so selflessly through his own life. President Obama said he looked forward to welcoming President Calderon to the White House on Thursday, March 3, to discuss our important bilateral relationship and key global issues.
