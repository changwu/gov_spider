Background:

Also, in June 2023, The Florida Police Benevolent Association (PBA) announced their endorsement of Ron DeSantis for President.
Florida PBA President John Kazanjian said:
"In major cities and communities across America, many Americans are grappling with increased crime rates that not only jeopardize public safety, but also threaten the quality of life in their communities. The ideological experiment of defunding the police and scapegoating law enforcement for America's social problems has failed. Now more than ever, Americans must elect the one candidate for president who has a proven track record in enhancing public safety and investing in the essential men and women who help maintain public safety every day. For the over 30,000 men and women in the Florida Police Benevolent Association, the choice for us could not be clearer. Governor Ron DeSantis and his administration have made Florida a law-and-order state, by investing in and supporting the thousands of law enforcement officers, who serve on the front lines in keeping our communities safe and secure. From investing over $100 million dollars to increase the salaries of state law enforcement officers to recruiting the best men and women across the country to join our ranks, to investing $20 million to local law enforcement agencies to support their battle against the Fentanyl epidemic, to toughening the penalties for major crimes, Governor DeSantis has made Florida a destination for all Americans to live safely and freely. He is one of the most effective Governors in the nation and he will take his proven track record to the White House, where he will continue to have the backs of law enforcement officers and make public safety a top priority. For these reasons, the Florida PBA is proud to endorse our Governor, Ron DeSantis, for President of the United States and we will do all that we can to help him prevail."
