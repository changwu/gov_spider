    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis joined Will Cain on Fox News Tonight. The highlights are below.
On Bidenomics:
Bidenomics in a nutshell is: you pay more for the necessities of life, your standard of living goes down, the government gets bigger and more powerful, and ultimately China will benefit from a lot of stuff. The reason why Florida has done good, leading in net-in migration, leading in new business formations – our unemployment rate is way lower than the national average – is because we have rejected Bidenomics. We govern conservatively. We don't spend our state into oblivion.
On his strong fundraising haul and his path to victory:
Did you just see the news today about the record fundraising haul we've had? Nobody has been able to match that in the history of modern presidential politics, so we've got a huge amount of support to be able to take the case to the people. We really have not started that yet, we are in the process of building out a great organization and I think we're going to be on the ground in all these early states. It is a three yards and a cloud of dust type situation, that is what we are going to be doing. At the end of the day, nobody has stood up for hardworking Americans more than I have over these last five years and delivered the level of results that I have. That is going to be a great story to tell because if we did it in Florida, we absolutely can do it as president. That will mean the border, the invasion stops, it will mean the economy's restored, and it is going to mean that woke ideology ends up in the dustbin of history.
