    The President spoke with Prime Minister Demirel of Turkey today on the escalating crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The President is concerned about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and calls on the parties to declare an immediate cease-fire so that they can attempt to resolve their differences peacefully.
The involvement of the CSCE in the crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh reflects the deep concern of the international community about the violence that threatens to scar this region for generations to come. The parties must not seek to gain a temporary military advantage during a time of great uncertainty and heightened tensions. We call on them to exercise restraint even in the face of apparent provocation. The bloodshed must end.
The United States joins Turkey, Russia, and other countries in calling for an immediate cease-fire and for Armenia and Azerbaijan to cooperate with the CSCE to put a peaceful end to this growing tragedy.
