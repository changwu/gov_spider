    On Friday, August 21st, Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Miami, Florida. There, the Vice President will deliver remarks on the Trump administration's rejection of the failed ideologies advanced by the dangerous dictatorships in Venezuela and Cuba. The Trump administration has fought these tyrannical regimes by increasing economic pressure, imposing sanctions and through multilateral diplomatic action. The Vice President will echo the Trump administration's continued support of the Venezuelan and Cuban people as they fight against oppressive regimes and underscore that communism and socialism promise progress and prosperity, but deliver only poverty and corruption. By contrast, this Administration pursued pro-growth policies, which led to a historic low unemployment rate of 2.8% and 610,600 Florida jobs added since 2016. Since the pandemic, Florida has recovered over 500,000 jobs. As Florida continues to reopen, 77% of small businesses have opened their doors, allowing for a drop in unemployment numbers from 13.8% in April to 10.4%. Later that evening, the Vice President will return to Washington, D.C
Additional details about the Vice President's trip are forthcoming.
