    I HAVE been deeply saddened to learn of the death of Representative Frank Bow of Ohio. In over 20 years of outstanding service in the Congress, Frank Bow earned respect as a man of energy, principle, and dedication. As ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, he was a strong voice for fiscal responsibility, repeatedly taking his stand against excessive Government spending.
I hardly need to add that as President, I found in Frank Bow a staunch friend and supporter---a man whose loyalty never wavered and whose commitment was always total. His loss will be felt by his colleagues in the Congress, and by all Americans who value the example of a life well spent in the public service. Mrs. Nixon and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Frank Bow's family and many friends.
