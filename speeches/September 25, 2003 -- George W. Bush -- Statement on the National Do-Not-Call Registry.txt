    Unwanted telemarketing calls are intrusive, annoying, and all too common. When Americans are sitting down to dinner or parents are reading to their children, the last thing they want is a call from a stranger with a sales pitch.
For that reason, I have strongly supported the actions of the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to establish a National Do-Not-Call Registry and protect consumers.
The millions of people who have signed up for the list have the right to reduce unwanted telephone solicitations. I commend Congress for its rapid action to support the Registry, and I look forward to signing this legislation.
