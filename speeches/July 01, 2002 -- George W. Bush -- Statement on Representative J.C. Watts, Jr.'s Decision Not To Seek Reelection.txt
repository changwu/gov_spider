    Congressman J.C. Watts has served the people of Oklahoma and the United States with honor and distinction as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
J.C. will leave behind a legacy of compassion and commitment to public service. He has been a leader in highlighting the success of faith-based and community-based organizations, and thanks to his efforts, these organizations may soon have additional resources in their fight against abuse, addiction, and poverty. His leadership was recognized by members of his party, and as Chairman of the House Republican Conference Committee, J.C. has effectively promoted the positive agenda of the Republican Party.
Though his tenure in the House is ending, he still has many talents to offer his country, and I know he will continue to contribute. J.C. is a good friend, and Laura and I wish J.C and his wife, Frankie, and their family the best and thank him for his dedicated service.
