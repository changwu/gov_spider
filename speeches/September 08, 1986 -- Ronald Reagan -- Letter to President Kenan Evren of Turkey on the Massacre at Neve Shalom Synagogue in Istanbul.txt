    Dear Mr. President,
All Americans join with me in deploring and condemning yesterday's shocking attack on the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul. We, together with the Turkish people, mourn these murdered innocents.
This act of callous barbarity, like the hijacking of the Pan American aircraft in Karachi, underscores the need for cooperation amongst all civilized nations to combat international terrorism. Your government's prompt and firm denunciation of these terroristic acts stands as a noble example for other countries to follow. I join with you in mourning all who died in both of these terrible attacks.
Sincerely,
/ s / RONALD REAGAN
