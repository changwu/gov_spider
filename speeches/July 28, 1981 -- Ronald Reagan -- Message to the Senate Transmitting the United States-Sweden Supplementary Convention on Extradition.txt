    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view of receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Supplementary Convention on Extradition between the United States of America and Sweden, signed at Washington on May 27, 1981.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the treaty.
The supplementary extradition treaty updates an existing extradition treaty with Sweden of October 24, 1961. It expands the list of extraditable offenses to include: tax evasion, obstruction of justice, offenses relating to the international transfer of funds, and conspiracy to commit extraditable offenses. Upon entry into force it will amend the extradition convention between the United States and Sweden.
This treaty will improve upon our current extradition treaty with Sweden and will thus contribute to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
