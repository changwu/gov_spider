    It gives me great pleasure to sign S. 61, a bill to designate areas within and adjacent to the "Old Post Office Building" on Pennsylvania Avenue NW., in Washington, D.C., as the "Nancy Hanks Center."
Nancy Hanks served with distinction as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1969 to 1977. Hers was a strong and effective voice both for the arts and for safeguarding the creative integrity of artists and arts institutions.
The proposed Nancy Hanks Center would include the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the plaza adjoining the building, and the public use spaces within the Old Post Office, including the Pavilion and the clock observation tower. This designation is particularly apt since the renovation of the Old Post Office, its occupancy this year by Federal cultural agencies and commercial enterprises, and its exhibits are due in large measure to the talent and vigor of Nancy Hanks.
I am happy to sign this legislation honoring, in a lasting and appropriate way, a public servant who made major contributions to the cultural life of our nation.
