    Dear Madam Chairwoman:
This is to inform you that, pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, I have modified, on an emergency basis, the description of the articles covered by the quotas established in Proclamation No. 5294 to permit the entry of:
—articles containing 10 percent or less by dry weight of sugar and,
—articles containing over 10 percent by dry weight of sugar if they are:
(a) not principally of crystalline structure or not in dry amorphous form that are prepared for marketing to the retail consumers in the identical form and package in which imported;
(b) within the scope of item 183.05, contain not over 65 percent by dry weight of sugar, and are cake decorations and similar products to be used in the same condition as imported without any further processing other than the direct application to individual pastries or confections;
(c) within the scope of item 183.05, contain not over 65 percent by dry weight of sugar, and are finely ground or masticated coconut meat or juice mixed with sugar; or
(d) within the scope of item 183.0505, contain 20 percent or less by dry weight of sugar.
An unexpectedly large volume of imports of these sugar-containing articles has caused the quotas for these articles to be closed or nearly closed for this fiscal year. This early closing of these quotas was unanticipated and is working or is expected to work severe hardship on importers and users of a number of articles containing relatively small amounts of sugar.
I believe it is appropriate not to cause such hardship in connection with these articles in the context of emergency action, but rather to permit their entry pending the investigation by the United States International Trade Commission.
Therefore, I have issued this day a proclamation modifying the description of the articles covered by the quotas established in Proclamation No. 5294 to permit the entry of articles as indicated above.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Paula Stern, Chairwoman, United States International Trade Commission, 701 E Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20536]
