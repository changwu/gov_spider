Here's what he had to say about reports that visa applicants don't have their social media screened for radical leanings:
This is why the American people increasingly have zero confidence that this administration has any idea how to keep our country safe.
We know, for example, that one of the early indicators of radicalization is what people are doing online. That is what ISIS is using.
To not look at that as a factor . . . just defies all explanation.
He calledÂ for much tougher screening of immigrants whose backgrounds aren't known to authorities:
You have someone that's arriving [in America] for the first time, who we know nothing about, that's someone you're going to have to take a little bit more time to look at a little more carefully, and err on the side of caution.
That's the kind of approach we can take, instead of this notion that somehow our immigration system needs to be a place in which we play political messaging games. . . .
If it's an eight-year-old child who's an orphan, you can vet that. But the vast majority of people that are trying to come are people that we just don't have information on. You can run their name on the database a thousand times, nothing's going to pop up, because there's no databases for people coming from Syria.
This is an issue that you have to be right 100 percent. You cannot afford to be wrong on even one, because if you're wrong on one, that could be an ISIS killer, who comes to the U.S. and carries out a terror attack. There's no margin of error when it comes to this.
