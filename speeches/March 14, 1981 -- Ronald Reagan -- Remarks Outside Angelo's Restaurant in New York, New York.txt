    Senator D'Amato and Congressman Molinari, your ladies, you ladies and gentlemen:
I just want to tell you I'm delighted to be here. And I want you to know that in these gentlemen beside me, you are well represented in Washington.
And Congressman Molinari has made a very great personal sacrifice to stay and help us with this program that we are trying to implement. I know you can hear all kinds of things about it and what it's going to do or not going to do. But is there anyone here that doesn't believe that we have to turn the direction around that we've been going, in order to end inflation, end unemployment, and get this country back where it should be in the eyes of the world? [Cheers]
Well, that's what we're going to try to do. And as I say, it's really a great pleasure to be here. Between us, we'll all go to work, and we'll all try to do it there in Washington.
And now they tell me that they're going to take me inside and feed me. [Laughter] And I heard so much last night about how I'm going to be fed, I haven't had any breakfast yet. [Laughter] I've been waiting for this.
God bless you all. It's good to see you,. and thank you for being here. Thank you.
