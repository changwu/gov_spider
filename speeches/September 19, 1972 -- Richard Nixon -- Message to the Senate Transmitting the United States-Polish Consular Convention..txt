    To the Senate of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification the Consular Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Polish People's Republic, with Protocol, signed at Warsaw on May 31, 1972, on the occasion of my recent visit there. The Convention was accompanied by two related exchanges of notes, which are transmitted for the information of the Senate.
The signing of this treaty is a significant step in the gradual process of improving and broadening the relationship between the United States and Poland. Consular relations between the two countries have not previously been subject to formal agreement. This Convention will establish firm obligations on such important matters as free communication between a citizen and his consul, notification to consular offices of the arrest and detention of their citizens, and permission for visits by consuls to citizens who are under detention.
The people of the United States and Poland enjoy a long tradition of friendship. I welcome the opportunity through this Consular Convention to strengthen the ties between our two nations. I urge the Senate to give the Convention its prompt and favorable consideration.
RICHARD NIXON
