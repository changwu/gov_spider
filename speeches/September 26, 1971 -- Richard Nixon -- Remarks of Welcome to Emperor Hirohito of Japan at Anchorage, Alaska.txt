    Your Imperial Majesties, our honored guests:
I am deeply honored, Your Imperial Majesties, on behalf of all the people of the United States, to welcome you to our country.
As you departed from Tokyo just a few hours ago, you received a magnificent farewell tribute from the people of Japan. Tonight, the American people are proud to join in that tribute to Your Majesties.
Just 50 years ago, Your Majesty became the first Crown Prince of Japan to travel to a foreign country. Tonight Your Majesty becomes the first reigning monarch of Japan in your long history to step on foreign soil.
Your journey symbolizes Japan's growing position in world affairs. We meet in Anchorage, Alaska, a place which is approximately the same distance between Tokyo and Washington, D.C. And this fact reminds us that for the past quarter century that we have built a structure of political, economic, and cultural ties which spans the space between our two countries. And may this historic meeting, the first meeting in history between the Emperor of Japan and the President of the United States, demonstrate for all the years to come the determination of our two great peoples to work together in friendship for peace and prosperity for the Pacific and for all people in the world.
Your Majesties, we are most proud and happy to have you on American soil and, as you go on your journey, our thoughts and our prayers go with you.
