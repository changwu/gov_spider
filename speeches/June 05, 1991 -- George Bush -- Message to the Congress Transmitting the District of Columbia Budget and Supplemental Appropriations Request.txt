    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Government's 1992 budget request and 1991 budget supplemental request.
The District of Columbia Government has submitted three alternative 1992 budget requests. The first alternative is for $3,083 million in 1992 and includes a Federal payment of $425 million, which is the currently authorized level. The second alternative is for $3,142 million and includes a Federal payment of $484 million, which is the amount contained in the 1992 Federal budget. The third alternative is for $3,288 million, which includes a Federal payment of $631 million, the amount requested by the D.C. Mayor and City Council. My transmittal of this District budget, as required by law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
There are two specific issues to which I would direct your attention. First, I encourage you to continue the abortion funding policy enacted in the District's 1989, 1990, and 1991 appropriations laws. The Congress should continue to prohibit the use of both Federal and congressionally appropriated local funds for abortions, except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.
Second, the 1992 budget proposes to modify and make permanent the 1990 pilot project that requires the District of Columbia to charge Fedeal establishments directly for water and sewer services. Inappropriate charges and excessive usage have been eliminated through this pilot project. Taxpayers have been relieved of the burden of paying water bills totaling over $4 million for non-Federal entities. Further reductions of 6 - 10 percent in Federal appropriations for water and sewer services have also been realized because non-appropriated, self-financing entities are now required to pay for the services they receive.
