    Idaho Congressman Raul Labrador today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce: Â 
"Hispanic Americans gave President Obama our trust. He has disappointed us. He promised an economic recovery. Instead, we've had three and a half years of unemployment above 10 percent. Our debt is out of control, and President Obama has offered nothing in the way of a plan to reduce spending. What we spend today our children and grandchildren will have to pay back in the future. Many Hispanics fled failing governments and bloated bureaucracies to avoid just such destructive policies, and now we see them in action here, in the United States. We've come too far to leave that kind of burden on the next generation. Unlike Barack Obama, Mitt Romney has presented real, concrete plans to bring down unemployment, encourage small business, and reduce the debt and deficit. We need that kind of leadership in Washington."
