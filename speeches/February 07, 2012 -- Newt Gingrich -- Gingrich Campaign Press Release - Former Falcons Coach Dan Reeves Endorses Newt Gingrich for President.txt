    Atlanta, GA - Former Atlanta Falcons football coach Dan Reeves on Monday endorsed Newt Gingrich for President, calling him a "tough" candidate who "knows what needs to be done to get the country on the right track."
Reeves, who took the Falcons to the Super Bowl in 1998, said he is supporting Gingrich because, "he is the most experienced candidate and the one who can take out Obama."
"Newt's tough and you have got to be tough for a job like that â€” just like a football coach," Reeves said. "You will get second guessed a lot, but you have to know what you are doing and do what's best for the country."
Upon hearing news of the endorsement, Newt Gingrich said, "I am honored by the endorsement of such a motivating leader. Coach Reeves led his teams to great success, and I hope to do the same."
