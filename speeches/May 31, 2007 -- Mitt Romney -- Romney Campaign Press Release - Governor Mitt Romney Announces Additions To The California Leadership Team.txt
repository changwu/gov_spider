Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney announced today that Coronado Communications, led by Duane Dichiara, will head the daily operations of the California Romney for President campaign. Rob Stutzman and Mike Schroeder were named Senior Advisers for the California campaign. They join previously announced State Chairs Tony Strickland and Senate Minority Leader Dick Ackerman.
"California will play an important role in the upcoming primary elections, and this team will be critical in making sure every voter knows about my message of change in Washington," said Governor Romney. "I look forward to working with them so we can bring conservative leadership back to our government."
With today's announcement, Duane Dichiara said, "Coronado Communications is committed to electing a leader who is not afraid to fight for conservative principles and demand change. Governor Romney's proven leadership is needed today more than ever. He has successfully turned around private businesses, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and state government, and he will do the same as President."
Senior Adviser Rob Stutzman said, "Governor Romney is a strong leader who doesn't just talk about change, he gets real results. By using proven conservative principles, Governor Romney has shown he is the candidate who can establish benchmarks in Washington to streamline government and return fiscal responsibility to our nation's capital. I'm convinced Governor Romney is the candidate for Republican voters in California."
Senior Adviser Mike Schroeder added, "Governor Romney has a strong California team and we will work to make sure every voter in California knows Governor Romney is the leader our country needs. His new and innovative ideas are what our country needs to remain strong."
