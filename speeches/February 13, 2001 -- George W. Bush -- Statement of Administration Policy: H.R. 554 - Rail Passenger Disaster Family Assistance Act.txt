    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Reps. Young (R) Alaska and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 554, which would establish procedures for providing timely information and assistance to victims of rail accidents and their families.
The Administration may seek amendments as Congress continues its consideration of this bill. In particular, section 2(g)(2) of the bill, relating to unsolicited communications between potential parties to litigation arising out of such accidents, may pose First Amendment concerns which the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address.
