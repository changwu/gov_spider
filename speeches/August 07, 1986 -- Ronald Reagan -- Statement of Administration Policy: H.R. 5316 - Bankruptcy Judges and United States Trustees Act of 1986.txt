    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rodino (D) New Jersey)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5316. The Administration believes, however, that the United States Trustees program should be financed by direct appropriations and not through a special fund, which would needlessly restrict both the Congress and the Executive branch in overseeing and controlling the budgets of the United States Trustees.
