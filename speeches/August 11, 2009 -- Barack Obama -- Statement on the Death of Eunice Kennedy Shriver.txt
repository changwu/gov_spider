    Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn about the passing of Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Eunice was many things to many people: a mother who inspired her children to serve others, a wife who supported her husband Sargent in the Peace Corps and in politics, and a sister to her siblings, including brothers John, Robert, and Edward. But above all, she will be remembered as the founder of the Special Olympics, as a champion for people with intellectual disabilities, and as an extraordinary woman who, as much as anyone, taught our Nation and our world that no physical or mental barrier can restrain the power of the human spirit. Her leadership greatly enriched the lives of Special Olympians throughout the world who have experienced the pride and joy of competition and achievement thanks to her vision.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Sargent, their children Robert, Maria, Timothy, Mark, and Anthony, and the entire Kennedy family.
