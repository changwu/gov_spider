    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3235 because Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) no longer need special support from the Federal Government either to develop as an industry or to expand their portion of the healthcare marketplace. Today there are 26 million people enrolled in HMOs. Enrollment in HMOs continues to grow by over 25 percent per year and is projected to reach 55 million persons by 1990. The administration is confident that the HMO industry can stand on its record of delivering quality and cost-effective care without continued protection from market competition.
