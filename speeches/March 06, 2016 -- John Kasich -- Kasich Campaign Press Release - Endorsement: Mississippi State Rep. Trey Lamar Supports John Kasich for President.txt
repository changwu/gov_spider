    Today Mississippi State Representative Trey Lamar announced his support for Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign and joined Kasich for America's Mississippi leadership team.
"It's the right thing to do," said Lamar on his decision to publicly support Governor Kasich. "Our country is headed down the wrong path, and it will take an experienced and steady hand to correct our course. It takes a leader like John Kasich, who has consistently fought to balance budgets, cut taxes and regulations and spur the job creation that lifts all Americans. Mississippi voters are looking for a candidate who brings real solutions to the challenges they face. I am confident that John Kasich is the right person for the job, and I'm proud to stand by his side."

Lamar, Vice-Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, represents the state's 8th House District. He resides in Senatobia, Mississippi.
Said Kasich, "I'm honored to receive the endorsement of Rep. Trey Lamar, who demonstrates a deep commitment to safeguarding taxpayer money in Mississippi. He brings a valuable perspective and a welcomed boost to our campaign as we make our final push toward the primary election."
