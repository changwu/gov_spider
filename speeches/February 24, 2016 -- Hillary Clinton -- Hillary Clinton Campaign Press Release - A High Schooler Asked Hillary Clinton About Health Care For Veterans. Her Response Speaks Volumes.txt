    
She's been thinking about this issue for a very long time.
At a student town hall in Nevada, a high school student asked a question that Hillary Clinton has been thinking about for a long time—how can we help veterans who suffer from mental health issues?
Her detailed answer shows how deeply she cares about this issue—and the thoughtful way she would approach it as commander in chief.
She talked about her experience as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, where she worked on health issues like PTSD and traumatic brain injuries. 
She's seen the devastating toll of mental health issues up close—she told the audience about a young Army captain she met when she was visiting patients at Walter Reed. He has lost his arm and was newly adjusting to a prosthetic limb. 

She emphasized the need to expand mental health screenings and treatments covered by the VA—and help military members get the assistance they need before they transition back into civilian life. 
And she elaborated on different treatment options and programs she has seen work for veterans and their families—and stressed the need to treat every individual based on his or her unique needs.
