This comes after many in the Hispanic community have expressed their concern over Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney’s inability to appeal to the Latino voter. “Romney's vision as an elitist candidate leaves behind the silent majority as does Santorum's who believes he is the only conservative candidate. Gingrich is the candidate who is the conveyer of all Americans regardless of ethnicity, party affiliation or social-economic background,” stated Massey Villarreal, Former National Chairman, Republican National Hispanic Assembly and Co-Chair of the Hispanic Steering Committee.
“Newt's unqualified respect for and deep understanding of the Hispanic community, coupled with his reasonable plans for dealing with our most pressing issues; have earned him the loyalty and support of countless community leaders across the nation,” explained Rosario Marin, former Treasurer of the United States and Co-Chair of the Hispanic Steering Committee for Newt Gingrich. “Come November he will be rewarded by the Hispanic voter,” added Marin.
Newt Gingrich has made Hispanic Inclusion a central part of his campaign. In each state he has had Hispanic State leaders and events specifically geared to the Latino community. Newt Gingrich has launched his site in Spanish, NewtPresidente.com, as well as a mini communications campaign “Newt Con Nosotros.” In most states voters will find “Newt Con Nosotros” banners, yard signs, Contracts with America, and bumper stickers alongside Newt 2012 items.
The reason Newt Gingrich has garnered such support amongst Hispanics is simple: He has been reaching out for decades. Latinos know the difference between someone who reaches out because they want their vote, and someone who reaches out because their concerns truly matter. Gingrich’s support is sincere and goes back to his days in Congress.
Newt Gingrich also understands how this economy is truly hurting Hispanics. “Newt is the only candidate who has the experience and understanding on how to get the economy growing again. As Speaker of the house Newt created millions of jobs for all Americans. It is going to take this type of leadership  to bring back America to prosperity.  This will help millions of Latinos who are the fastest growing work force in America”, added Mario Rodriguez, CEO of Hispanic 100 and Co-Chair of the Hispanic Steering Committee.
“What is clear to me today, and has always been very clear, is that Hispanics are amongst the most pro-life, pro-religion, pro-entrepreneurship, pro-jobs, pro-family Americans in our country. It is clear to me that Hispanics should be welcomed as true American conservatives,” said Newt Gingrich.
