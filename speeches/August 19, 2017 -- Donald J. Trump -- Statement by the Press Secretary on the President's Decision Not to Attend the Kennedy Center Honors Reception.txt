    Each year, the Kennedy Center honors the careers and achievements of artists who have helped shape cultural life in the United States with a weekend that includes celebrations and events.
The award recipients are recognized for their lifetime contributions in the arts and the positive change they have made all over the world.
The President and First Lady have decided not to participate in this year's activities to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.
First Lady Melania Trump, along with her husband President Donald J. Trump, extend their sincerest congratulations and well wishes to all of this year's award recipients for their many accomplishments.
