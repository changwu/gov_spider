    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Riegle (D) Michigan and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 2209 because establishment of a National Space Council within the Executive Office of the President would unacceptably interfere with the President's discretion and flexibility in organizing and managing the Executive Office as he sees appropriate. If S. 2209 were presented to the President in its present form, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it. The President vetoed a NASA authorization bill in 1986 because it would have established a National Space Council within the Executive Office.
