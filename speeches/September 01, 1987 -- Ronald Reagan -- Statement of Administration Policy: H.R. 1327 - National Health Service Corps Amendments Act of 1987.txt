    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California and 12 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1327 unless it is amended to:

— create a single authorization for appropriations for all National Health Service Corps (NHSC) activities that would require priority funding for (a) continued support for those individuals already participating in the NHSC program, and (b) service to medically underserved areas through State loan repayment programs that contain matching requirements.
— authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make matching grants to States to support State loan repayment programs. The administration supports the use of a Federal/State matching program for all NHSC loan repayment activities.
— permit the Secretary of HHS to require NHSC assignees to serve in remote rural areas, where the most significant health manpower problems remain.
