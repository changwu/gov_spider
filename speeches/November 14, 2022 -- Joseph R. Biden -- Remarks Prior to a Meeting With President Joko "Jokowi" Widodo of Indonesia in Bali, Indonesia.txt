    President Widodo. President Biden, welcome to Bali. Welcome to Indonesia.
President Biden. Thank you.
President Widodo. I really appreciate the presence of President Biden at this G-20 summit. And, once again, I really appreciate your presence here. And tomorrow we will discuss and start the G-20 summit. And I hope that the G-20 summit will be able to produce complete cooperation that will help global economic recovery.
President Biden. Well, as I told you, Mr. President, I don't think I'm going home. [Laughter] [Inaudible]—you had me staying on the beach. I don't know. [Laughter]
It's great to see you again, Jokowi. This is a—you've been a good friend. And I was happy to welcome you, back in May, at the White House. And I want to thank you for your hospitality and your support at this G-20. You've done a wonderful job thus far.
Indonesia is a vibrant and critical, critical partner. As two of the largest democracies in the world, we're working together to preserve the rule-based system and international order and to uphold human rights.
And together, we're pursuing a better future. We've finalized a new partnership, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to invest nearly $700 million in developing high-quality transportation and infrastructure here in Indonesia.
And tomorrow we'll unveil a transformative new partnership to support Indonesia's clean energy transition.
And finally, we've collaborated to protect our people, including improving our ability to fight infectious disease with the launch of a historic pandemic fund.
And, Mr. President, I look forward to discussing all of this with you today. And thank you again, Mr. President, for your hospitality and all you've done. It's good to see you. It's good to be here.
