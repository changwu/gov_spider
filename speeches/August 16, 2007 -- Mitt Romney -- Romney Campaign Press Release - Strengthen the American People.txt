CLINTON: "As I travel around America, I hear from so many people who feel like they're just invisible to their government... Americans from all walks of life across our country may be invisible to this President, but they're not invisible to me and they won't be invisible to the next President of the United States..." (Clinton For President, Television Ad, "Invisible," 8/15/07)
But It's Money In Americans' Wallets That Would Become Invisible:
Sen. Clinton Wants To Eliminate The Bush Tax Cuts. "Joining other Democratic women senators at an event for Sen. Barbara Boxer, who's seeking re-election, Hillary Clinton told hundreds of party faithful to expect to lose some of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush if Democrats take control in Washington next year." (Beth Fouhy, "San Francisco Rolls Out Red Carpet For The Clintons," The Associated Press, 6/28/04)

HILLARY CLINTON: "It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few, time to reject the idea of an 'on your own' society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.

Sen. Hillary Clinton Ad:

(Clinton For President, Television Ad, "Invisible," 8/15/07)
But Hillary Clinton Has Already Tried And Failed To Pass Socialized Medicine:
Sen. Clinton Has Vowed To Have A "Universal" Health Care System Paid For By Taxpayers If Elected. "Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Monday to create a universal health care system if elected, saying she 'learned a lot' during the failed health care effort of her husband's presidency. 'We're going to have universal health care when I'm president - there's no doubt about that. We're going to get it done,' the New York senator and front-runner for the 2008 nomination said." (Mike Glover, "Clinton Touts Universal Health Care Plan," The Associated Press, 3/26/07)
"Universal Healthcare" Is Just A Rehash Of The Failed HillaryCare Of The Early 1990s. "But in the longer term, it's a just one more step on the road to 'HillaryCare' - the program of government-run, universal health-care that Americans rejected so decisively in the early Clinton years. The problem, as the Clinton plan foretold, is that eventually bureaucrats will decide which medical procedures are covered and which aren't, with patients forced to see a government-approved doctor instead of choosing their own, and health-care services rationed (again, by bureaucrats) to hold down costs."

Sen. Hillary Clinton Ad:

But Sen. Clinton Flip-Flopped, Voting Against Funding Our Troops:
In 2003, Sen. Clinton Voted For The $87 Billion Supplemental Appropriations To Fund US Troops In Iraq And Afghanistan. (S. 1689, CQ Vote #400: Passed 87-12: R 50-0; D 37-11; I 0-1, 10/17/03, Clinton Voted Yea)
- At The Time, Sen. Clinton Called The Funding " A Vote For Our Troops" And "A Vote For Our Mission." (Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, "Senator Clinton Votes for Iraq Appropriation In Support of U.S. Troops," Press Release, 10/17/03)
But This Past May, Sen. Clinton Voted Against The Iraq Supplemental Spending Bill Funding The Troops In Afghanistan And Iraq. (H.R. 2206, CQ Vote #181: Passed 80-14: R 42-3; D 37-10; I 1-1, 5/24/07, Clinton Voted Nay)
