    Bush Renews Veto Threat Today, Defying Congress
The Clinton campaign has launched an online petition urging President Bush not to veto legislation passed by the Senate and supported by a majority of Americans that would set a March 2008 timeline for the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Even as Bush renewed his veto threat today, Hillary's petition sends a strong message to the President that he must change course in Iraq. You can view the petition here.
"This bill represents the will not only of the Congress but of the American people," Clinton said. "The President is making a grave mistake by refusing to work with the Congress to change direction in Iraq. It is time for him to recognize that the American people want a new policy."
In a press conference today, President Bush vowed to veto any bill setting a timetable for withdrawal. He said he would only sign a funding bill giving him a blank check to continue the war in Iraq without any strings attached.
"Mr. President, please work with us. Don't veto the will of the American people. Let's get together and see if we can work out an approach that will make it safe and expeditious for us to begin to bring our troops home," Clinton said.
