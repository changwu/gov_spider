    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In furtherance of the provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund. These reallocations reflect revised priorities in light of changing national security and homeland security needs in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
As provided in Public Law 107-38, $220 million will be made available 15 days from the date of this transmittal for the Government of Pakistan and $39.8 million will be made available immediately for International Assistance Programs and the Department of the Treasury.
The details of these actions are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
