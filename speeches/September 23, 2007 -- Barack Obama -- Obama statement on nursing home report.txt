    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today released a statement on the report in the New York Times on nursing homes.
"The news that some private equity firms have been boosting profits at the nursing homes they own by cutting essential staff and compromising the quality of care for our seniors is unconscionable and unacceptable. America's workers and America's seniors deserve better, and the American public deserves to know exactly what's going on in these nursing homes."
'I led the fight in Illinois to pass the Hospital Report Cards Act that required hospitals to disclose details on nurse staffing and the quality of care so that the everyone was aware how well their health care system worked. When I'm President, this kind of transparency will be a part of my universal health care reform that provides every American with affordable, quality health care."
