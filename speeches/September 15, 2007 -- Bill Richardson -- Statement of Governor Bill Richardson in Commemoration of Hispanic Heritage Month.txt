    SANTA FE, NM-- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement in commemoration of Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15 to October 15:
"Today marks the beginning of a monthlong celebration of Hispanic culture and tradition in the United States. I salute the many hardworking Hispanic families who have made this great country even stronger.
"I am proud to be the first Hispanic Democratic Presidential candidate. I honor my heritage and applaud the contributions of Hispanics to American culture.
"Hispanics are the largest minority group in the United States. To reach this increasingly important group of Americans, I am proud that my campaign has started Mi Familia con Bill Richardson, a national Hispanic outreach and organizing program. Mi Familia con Bill Richardson will involve Hispanic families in the political process and spread my message to communities around the country.
"I want to take this opportunity to salute the Hispanic men and women proudly serving in our armed forces. As a group, Hispanics have sacrificed much for our country. Despite comprising only fourteen percent of the U.S. population, Hispanics have accounted for an estimated twenty percent of the casualties in Iraq.
"Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates the many contributions of Hispanics in the United States and honors the diversity which makes this country great."
