    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Letlow, R-LA, and 122 cosponsors)
The Administration does not support H.R. 5 in its current form because the bill does not actually help parents support their children at school. Moreover, instead of making LGBTQI+ students feel included in their school community, it puts them at higher risk. The Administration strongly supports actions that empower parents to engage with their children's teachers and schools, like enabling parents to take time off to attend school meetings. Legislation should not politicize our children's education. It should deliver the resources that schools and families actually need.
