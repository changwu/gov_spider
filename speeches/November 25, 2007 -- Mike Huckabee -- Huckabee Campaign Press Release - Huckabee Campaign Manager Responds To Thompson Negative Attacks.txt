    Little Rock, AR - Huckabee for President Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman issued the following statement today in response to news releases by the Thompson campaign about Governor Mike Huckabee:
"The desperate attacks on Governor Huckabee by Fred Thompson are evidence that Fred's show is running out of material and he's left to cranking out re-runs. Fred has been confused about being pro-life, but Governor Huckabee never has been. Governor Huckabee helped successfully lead the passage of human life amendment in his state and as governor signed numerous pro-life bills. Fred was taking money as a Washington lobbyist to be a mouthpiece for a pro-abortion group when Governor Huckabee was leading the March for Life. Governor Huckabee always has supported a Human Life Amendment, but also knows that the repeal of Roe v. Wade is better than the current laws.
"The Thompson campaign is also distorting Governor Huckabee's views on illegal immigration by failing to recognize that sealing the border is his top priority. Regarding legislation to stop illegals from getting drivers' licenses, Act 2210 of 2005 was signed into law by Governor Huckabee. The legislation made it illegal for a driver's license to be issued to anyone who could not prove legal residency in Arkansas.
"It's not surprising that Fred has hired an attack dog to churn out the very kind of 'hit and run' politics that Americans are sick of. Governor Huckabee is rising to Fred's fall precisely because he is telling America what he would do to solve America's problems while Fred is left to trying to resort to political dumpster diving."
