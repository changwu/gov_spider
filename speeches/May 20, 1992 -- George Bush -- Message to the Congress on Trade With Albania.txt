    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 402(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act") (19 U.S.C. 2432(c)(2)(A)), I have determined that a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 with respect to Albania will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. A copy of that determination is enclosed. I have also received assurances with respect to the emigration practices of Albania required by section 402(c)(2)(B) of the Act. This message constitutes the report to the Congress required by section 402(c)(2).
Pursuant to section 402(c)(2), I shall waive by Executive order the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act with respect to Albania.
