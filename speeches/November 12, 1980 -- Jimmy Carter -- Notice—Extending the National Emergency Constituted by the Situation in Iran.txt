    On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order No. 12170 I declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. Since that situation continues, the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in effect after November 14, 1980. Therefore, pursuant to section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. Sec. 1622(d)) I am signing this notice of the continuance of the national emergency and causing this notice to be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and transmitted to the Congress.
