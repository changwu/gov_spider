    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Herger (R) California)
The Administration supports H.R. 457.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 457 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 3990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
