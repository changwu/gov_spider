Travel pool report #3 — church departure 
Wilmington, Del.
A masked POTUS, carrying a piece of paper, left St. Joseph at 11:17 a.m. amid heavy falling snow, accompanied by one of his granddaughters (pooler was too far away to identify). He got into the Beast a minute later and we are rolling as of 11:19 a.m.
Earlier as POTUS arrived, two protesters were present at the church. One held a white sign that read: "JOE BIDEN EQUALS ABORTION EUTHANASIA AND INFANTICIDE"
