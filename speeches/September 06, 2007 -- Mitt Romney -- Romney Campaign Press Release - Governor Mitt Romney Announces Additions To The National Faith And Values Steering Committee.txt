Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the addition of 25 new members to the Romney for President National Faith and Values Steering Committee, a coalition of supporters who are advising Governor Romney on matters of faith and values.
"To build a stronger America, we need to strengthen our families. Some of the most important work done in America today is being done within the four walls of the American home. If we are to strengthen families, we must champion our most basic values of life and marriage. The men and women of our Faith and Values Steering Committee have been strong leaders in defending these values, and I am proud to have them as part of our team," said Governor Romney.
The Steering Committee's Chair, noted Constitutional Attorney and Supreme Court Advocate Jay Sekulow, said, "Governor Romney has demonstrated exceptional leadership in defending some of our most important values. At critical moments, he stood strong for the sanctity of life and traditional marriage. Throughout this campaign, he has been the most articulate candidate speaking to the need to build stronger families, and he is the only candidate building a coalition of faith and values leaders."
