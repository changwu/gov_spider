Out of town pool report #1 — Checking in
I'm your print pool reporter for today. We originally had an 11 a.m. call time, but a lunch lid was called at 10:51. The lid lasts until 1 p.m., whereupon we will head to the pool hold on Kiawah Island.
I have not heard any updates from the White House about schedule or events today. It's a beautiful morning in the lowcountry, weather calls for isolated summer thunderstorms this afternoon with a high of 84°F.

The pool left our Charleston hotel at 1:00 p.m. and arrived at the hold at 1:45. I'll send any other updates today as they arise.

Out of town pool report #2 — Church[APP Note: See reporter's note in Report #4 regarding the numbering of this report.]
We received word this afternoon that the president would attend Mass at 5:30, were transported, arrived at 5:36 and are now holding outside of the church. The press was not allowed off of the bus.
President Biden is attending the Saturday evening service at Holy Spirit Catholic Church on Johns Island, South Carolina, not far from Kiawah. The church does not stream its Saturday services.
According to the church's website, it was founded in 1939 and built with volunteer labor at a grand total cost of $714. The present, much larger brick structure opened in 2004. It's a brick building with a three-story bell tower, surrounded by local vegetation including plenty of pine trees and spanish moss. There is a small pond by the entrance with a "beware of alligators" sign.
The pool caught a glimpse of the back of the president's head as he entered the church, also at 5:36.

Out of town pool report #4 — church over
Note: Last pool report should have been #3, so we're now fixing that by calling this one #4. Also, the pool was let off the bus after all, though we were told initially that would not be the case.
President Biden left the church at 6:25 along with Hunter Biden as music rang out from the bell tower. He did not take questions but did wave after entering the Suburban. The motorcade left at 6:26 and we are rolling.
