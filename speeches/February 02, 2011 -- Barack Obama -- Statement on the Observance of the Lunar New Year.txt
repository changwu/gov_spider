    I send my best wishes to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and all who celebrate the Lunar New Year across the United States and around the world.
As people of all cultures and faiths welcome in the new year, let all of us celebrate our families and our ancestors and enjoy the company of our loved ones. Across America, in large cities and in small towns, many will mark this occasion with festive celebrations. Many Americans of Asian descent will carry on the rich traditions of their heritage, reminding us again that America's strength comes from the richness of our cultures and the diversity of our people.
I wish all who celebrate the new year peace, prosperity, and good health.
