    Working Americans have been falling behind for far too long. As President, my job will be to change that. As Mayor of the largest and most diverse city in the country, I already have. My administration has put money back in the hands of working people. That's what the debate in Miami should be about - how we turn around this country and give hard-working Americans a better life. I look forward to making my case to my fellow Democrats and the American people.
