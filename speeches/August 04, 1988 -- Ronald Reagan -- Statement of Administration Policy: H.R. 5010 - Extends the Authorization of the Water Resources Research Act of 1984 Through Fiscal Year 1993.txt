    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Miller (D) California)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5010. If passed by the House, the Administration will work in the Senate to amend the bill to:

—    maintain the current law's non-Federal matching fund requirement for section 104 noncompetitive university water research institutes grants (i.e., a two-for-one State/Federal dollar match beginning in FY 1989);
—    delete the additional $5 million annual funding for section 104 noncompetitive university water research institutes grants. The current annual authorization for these grants is $10 million;
—    require that section 104 noncompetitive university water research institutes grants be used solely to fund water research of a regional or interstate nature deemed by the Secretary of the Interior to be in the national interest; and
—    eliminate the $6 million grant program for development of water-related technology. Technology development is more appropriately a State or private responsibility.
