    The President yesterday nominated three U.S. Court of Appeals judges: Martha Craig Daughtrey for the sixth circuit, Pierre N. Leval for the second circuit, and M. Blane Michael for the fourth circuit. In addition, the President also announced the nominations of U.S. District Court judges for Maryland, South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, the Eastern District of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, the Eastern District of Kentucky, and the Eastern District of Arkansas.
"There are few things that I will do that will have more lasting effect than the appointment of Federal judges," said the President. "Along with Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court and the many other judges yet to be named, this outstanding group of jurists will change the face of the Federal courts and help move our country forward."
