    Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished members of the United Nations community, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, my country is honored to welcome you to New York. This is my fourth General Assembly, and I'm very pleased to be among you as we open the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly this year under the leadership of Foreign Minister Ping of Gabon.
We last met in the shadow of a great tragedy. In August 2003, a terrorist attack in Baghdad took the lives of 22 servants of peace, including Sergio de Mello, who gave his life for the values of liberty and peace. We pledge, once again, to carry on their essential work.
That work is moving forward. U.N. officials are helping the people of Afghanistan as that nation moves toward an historic Presidential election this October. In Iraq, you're helping to build the infrastructure of democracy and prepare the way for free and fair nationwide elections. In Sudan and Liberia, Haiti and other nations, this body has been working hard to bring security, humanitarian assistance, and stability to the people in desperate need. Much credit for these efforts is due to Kofi Annan, who has shown strong vision.
Mr. Secretary-General, with admiration for your leadership and with confidence in this organization, I offer a toast to you and your service and to the United Nations.
