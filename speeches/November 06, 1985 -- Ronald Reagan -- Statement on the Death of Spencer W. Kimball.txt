    Spencer W. Kimball spent a long and full life devoted to his church and the service of his fellow man. As a young man, he combined dedication to work with an active role in charitable and community work, exemplifying the Mormon ethic of rugged free enterprise and mutual aid. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather, a contemporary of Joseph Smith, Spencer Kimball went on to 30 years of service in his church's governing Council of Twelve Apostles, before becoming president in 1973.
Nancy and I note with sorrow the passing of one of the important figures of our generation. Our deepest sympathy goes out to his wife and family.
