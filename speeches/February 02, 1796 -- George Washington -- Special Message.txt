    Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith the copy of a letter, dated the 19th of December last, from Governor Blount to the Secretary of War, stating the avowed and daring designs of certain persons to take possession of the lands belonging to the Cherokees, and which the United States have by treaty solemnly guaranteed to that nation. The injustice of such intrusions and the mischievous consequences which must necessarily result there from demand that effectual provision be made to prevent them.
GO. WASHINGTON.
