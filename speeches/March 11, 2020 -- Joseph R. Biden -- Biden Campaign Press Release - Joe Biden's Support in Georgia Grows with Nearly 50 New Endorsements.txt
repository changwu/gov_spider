    New Endorsements Underscore Biden's Strength in Georgia and Throughout the South
Today, Biden for President announced the endorsements of nearly 50 current and former Georgia lawmakers and community leaders.
"We know Joe. We know Joe's empathy. We know Joe's decency," said State Representative J. Craig Gordon. "And we also know that Joe is the best person to beat Donald Trump in November. As a Savannahian, I appreciate the Vice President's commitment to our ports infrastructure, climate change, and getting more Georgians health care. This moment demands a unifier who can heal our nation's cracks and lead on day one. That's Joe Biden."
"I'm excited to support Joe, who is the only candidate that has the ability to build the broad coalition required to take back the White House," said State Representative Matthew Wilson. "As Obama's Vice President, he fought every day for our priorities. I can't wait for March 24th, when Georgia gets its turn to send Joe back to the White House to continue fighting for our communities."
