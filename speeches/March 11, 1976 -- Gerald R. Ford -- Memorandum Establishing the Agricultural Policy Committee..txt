Subject: Establishment of Agricultural Policy Committee
This memorandum is to advise you of a recent agricultural policy making reorganization within my Administration.
I am creating a new Agricultural Policy Committee. Each of you is being designated as a member of this Committee, with Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz serving as Chairman.
This new Committee consolidates agricultural policy making into one group, which will advise me on the formulation, coordination and implementation of all food and agricultural policy. The scope of the Committee includes both domestic and international food and agricultural issues.
As you know, I am deeply interested in the many food and agricultural policy issues which face our Nation and the world.
I view this new Committee as the appropriate mechanism for dealing with these issues. It is my hope that your active participation in this Committee and the full support of your departments and agencies will lead to the success of this important new Committee in resolving the many significant issues of food and agricultural policy.
