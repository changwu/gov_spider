    FROM my own service in the Senate and House of Representatives I know how difficult it is, in the closing hours of a session, to obtain agreement on controversial, complex legislation. Therefore, I can understand the strain and frustration which marked the unsuccessful Congressional efforts to enact an emergency energy act in acceptable form before adjournment.
Nevertheless, I do regret very much that during this critical period just ahead we will not have the emergency powers I requested to meet the energy crisis, so that we could proceed more effectively to get the job done right--and on time.
The great majority of Americans, however, have already responded in a way that makes me confident we can get on with the job even without having the legislation in place at this time. It will be harder without the legislation, but it can be done. We will continue pressing for maximum voluntary cooperation in conserving energy, continue our efforts to assure fairness in distribution of available stocks of fuel, and continue doing all we can, using existing authorities, to expand production of fuel.
When Congress returns in January, I hope and trust that we can move promptly toward passage of new legislation that will be fair and effective--and that we can work toward this in a spirit of constructive cooperation between the political parties and between the executive and legislative branches. In short, I trust we can work toward it as concerned Americans meeting a challenge that we face together and are determined to meet together.
