    President Bush has always believed that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.
It's unfortunate that activist judges continue to seek to redefine marriage by court order - without regard for the will of the people. Today's decision by the Connecticut Supreme Court illustrates that a federal constitutional amendment may be needed if the people are to decide what marriage means.
President Bush remains firmly committed to protecting the sanctity of marriage.
