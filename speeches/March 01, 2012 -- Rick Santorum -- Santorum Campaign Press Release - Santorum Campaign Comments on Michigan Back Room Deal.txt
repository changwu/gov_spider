    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President Campaign made the following statement upon the delegate ruling from the Michigan Republican Party.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "There's just no way this is happening.  We've all heard rumors that Mitt Romney was furious that he spent a fortune in his home state, had all the political establishment connections and could only manage a tie with Rick Santorum.  But we never thought the Romney campaign would try to rig the outcome of an election by changing the rules after the vote. This kind of back room dealing political thuggery just cannot and should not happen in America."
