    I am very pleased with the action of the United States Senate in consenting to ratification of the INF treaty. In 2 days, I will arrive in the Soviet Union to meet with General Secretary Gorbachev to discuss our four-part agenda. Today's action by the Senate clearly shows support for our arms reduction objectives.
I want to express my appreciation for the leadership demonstrated by Majority Leader Bob Byrd and Republican leader Bob Dole in securing the timely approval of this treaty. I have invited them to join me for the exchange of ratification documents in Moscow.
I continue to have concerns about the constitutionality of some provisions of the resolution of ratification, particularly those dealing with interpretation, and I will communicate with the Senate on these matters in due course.
