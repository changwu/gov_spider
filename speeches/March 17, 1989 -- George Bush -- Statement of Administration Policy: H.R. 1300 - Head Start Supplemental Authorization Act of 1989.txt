    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kildee (D) MI)
The President has proposed serving as many as 95,000 more poor four-year olds in the Head Start program by increasing the FY 1990 appropriation authorization to $1,485 billion. This is $250 million more than the FY 1989 appropriation level of $1,235 billion. H.R. 1300 would increase the FY 1990 authorization to $1,552 billion.
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 1300, but will work for the enactment of an appropriation consistent with the President's proposal.
