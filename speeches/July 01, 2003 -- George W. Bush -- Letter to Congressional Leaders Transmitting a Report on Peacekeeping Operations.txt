    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I transmit herewith the 2002 Annual Report to the Congress on Peacekeeping, prepared by my Administration, consistent with section 4 of the United Nations Participation Act (Public Law 79-264), as amended.
United Nations and other peacekeeping operations around the world helped the United States protect our interests, and ensured that other nations shared with us the burdens, risks, and costs of maintaining international stability. In 2002, my Administration worked closely with the United Nations and key member states to promote sound peacekeeping policies, realistic mandates, and appropriately sized missions.
I will continue to work with the Congress to ensure that peacekeeping, under the right circumstances, remains a viable option for maintaining international peace and security.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
