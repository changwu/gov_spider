"It is an honor to have Governor Pawlenty's support," said Mitt Romney. "Tim will be a trusted adviser as I move forward with my campaign. Tim has always been an advocate for lower taxes, reduced spending, and an environment where jobs can be created. It is an honor to have him serve as Co-Chair to my campaign for the presidency."
"Mitt Romney is fighting for the same things I fought for as governor and during my campaign for president," said Governor Pawlenty. "As a former blue state governor, I appreciate what Mitt was able to do in Massachusetts. He created jobs and balanced his budgets without raising taxes – even with an over eighty percent Democrat legislature. That ability to get things done is what we need in our nominee. In addition, he has a background which is unmatched – his understanding of the private sector proves he knows how jobs are created which will be critical in turning our economy around. I am proud to endorse his candidacy for president of the United States."
