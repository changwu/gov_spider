    With voting still underway in New Hampshire, Fred Thompson's campaign for President today announced decisive moves to win South Carolina's vital Republican Primary. Staff, resources and advertising will all be focused on playing to win in the Palmetto State.
"Our campaign has long viewed South Carolina as the decisive contest in the opening of the 2008 campaign. We fought hard to get there and we intend to win there," declared campaign manager Bill Lacy.
The campaign's new South Carolina focus includes the "Clear Conservative Choice" bus tour, a statewide media buy beginning Thursday, and deployment of additional staff and measures to free additional resources for the fight.
"This campaign is going to be a South Carolina campaign. Our local South Carolina team, headed by veteran strategist Dean Rice, will be calling the plays on the ground. Everything from our ads to our bus schedule is going to be driven by South Carolina," explained Lacy.
The campaign's headquarters staff is going above and beyond the call of duty to shift the focus to South Carolina, as well. National office staff will work for reduced pay through the South Carolina voting.
"We are happy to be hitting the trail in South Carolina before the competition. Fred is already in the state and already winning votes. Fred has enjoyed an enthusiastic response in South Carolina. We are confident the next ten days will lead to an even greater response," Lacy added.
