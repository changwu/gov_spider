    LITTLE ROCK, AR - Former Arkansas Governor and Republican Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following comment regarding the National Right to Life Committee's endorsement today:
"I entered public service in 1992 because I am committed to defending life. I've led and signed numerous pro-life bills and have been unflinching in my commitment to the cause, even leading the March for Life each year.
"My record is one of executive leadership that has saved lives - and it is a strong one that speaks for itself. My convictions regarding the sanctity of life have always been clear and consistent, without equivocation or wavering.
"I am disappointed by this decision but I also know that the very grassroots activists across America who have made the National Right to Life movement a success will continue to join my campaign. I am thankful for their continued dedication and support."
