    The President. I want to thank Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson from Dallas, Texas, and you all for coming. I appreciate—Madam Chairman. I look forward to a good dialog on subjects that are on the Members' minds and on my mind, as well.
I think we'll have a good discussion about public education. While there may be some discussion about details, all of us surely believe the great hope for this country is to make sure every child—I mean every child—is educated. I look forward to sharing with the Members who don't know me well some of my experiences as the Governor of the State of Texas and what I've tried to do to fulfill that promise and fulfill that pledge.
This will be the beginning of, hopefully, a lot of meetings. I hope you come back, and I'll certainly be inviting. But thanks for coming. It's an important part of my job—is to talk to everybody who is in the legislative body. I will remind you all, I understand the difference between the executive branch and the legislative branch. I only get to suggest. You all pass the laws. And that's what we're here to work——
Representative Cynthia A. McKinney. That's right. [Laughter]
The President. I understand that well. But thank you all for coming. It's an honor for you to be here.
