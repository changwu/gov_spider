    Today, Massachusetts joins a growing coalition of states that have taken up the President's call to increase wages and ensure no American working full-time has to support a family in poverty. Taking action to benefit the working men and women in the Commonwealth, Governor Patrick today signed a law raising the state's $8 per hour minimum wage to $11 per hour by 2017. Governors, state legislatures, and private businesses are leading by taking action, and we urge Congress to join them so that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed.
