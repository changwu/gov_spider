    DNA testing positively identified the remains of the Vietnam War unknown disinterred from the Tomb of the Unknowns in May as those of the Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie. The Defense Department has notified the Blassie family and the other families involved in resolving this difficult case. I am pleased that one more family has finally learned the fate of a loved one, and I remain committed to seeking a full accounting of the missing in action from that conflict.
