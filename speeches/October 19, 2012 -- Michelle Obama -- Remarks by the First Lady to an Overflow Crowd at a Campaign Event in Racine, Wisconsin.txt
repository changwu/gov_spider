    MRS. OBAMA: You guys, thank you so much. It's so good to see you. We're got to -- we're going to get this done. We've got 18 more days! (Applause.) The home stretch. And you're going to hear me talk about what we have to do, but the ground game is going to make the difference.
So you all being as fired up and motivated and focused for these next few weeks is absolutely going to make the difference. We've got to get this man back in office for four more years, and we're going to do it. (Applause.)
We can't thank you enough for your support, your prayers, your love, your effort, your focus. It means the world to us. And this is the closest I get to home until the election, so I'm happy to be here.
So I'm going to go in there, talk; I think you guys will be able to hear me. But I wanted to make sure I got to come in and at least touch some hands. (Applause.) So stay fired up and ready to go!
Love you guys.
