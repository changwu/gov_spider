    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 3/20/92)(House)(Cranston (D) CA and Seymour (R) CA)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of S. 870, as reported by the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. This bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire by donation or purchase the Phleger Estate as an addition to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, San Francisco.
However, the Administration urges Congress, in its further consideration of this bill, to adopt the Senate version that authorizes acquisition by donation only. Federal authority to purchase the property, as provided by the House version of S. 870, could undermine private efforts to buy the property and donate it to the Federal Government. Moreover, the National Park Service has not conducted a land appraisal of this property. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate accurately the potential costs for the Federal Government to acquire this property.
