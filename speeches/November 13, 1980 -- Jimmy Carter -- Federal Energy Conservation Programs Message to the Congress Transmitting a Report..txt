    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit to the Congress the third annual report required under Section 381(c) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (P.L. 94-163; 420 U.S.C. 6361 (c)).
This report covers the energy conservation activities undertaken by Federal agencies during Fiscal Year 1979. These include the establishment of conservation policies and efficiency standards in Federal procurement and the development of a ten-year plan for energy conservation in Federally-owned or leased buildings. The report also describes programs for carrying out a public education program to encourage energy conservation and to promote vanpooling and carpooling arrangements.
