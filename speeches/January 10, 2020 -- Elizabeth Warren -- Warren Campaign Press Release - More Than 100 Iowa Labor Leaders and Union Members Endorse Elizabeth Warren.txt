    West Des Moines, IA—More than 100 labor leaders and union members from across Iowa have endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president.
"Elizabeth Warren has devoted her life to fighting for workers' rights and defending the middle class," said Mary Burke, a registered nurse, Iowa labor leader and SEIU member. "Whether she's in the halls of power, at a campaign town hall or on the picket line, Elizabeth has the same message: unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class. I'm standing with her because she stands up for us."
Elizabeth's plan to empower workers is the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal. She will extend labor rights to all workers and expand protections for part-time workers; prohibit so-called "right to work" laws; strengthen organizing, collective bargaining, and the right to strike; increase worker choice and control; and expand worker protections, combat discrimination, and improve enforcement of labor laws. She will also ban non-compete agreements, empower workers to elect 40% of board members for companies with over a billion dollars in revenue, and amend federal law to promote sectoral bargaining across industries.
"I'm grateful to have the support of such a broad slate of labor leaders and union members supporting my campaign and my plans to put power in the hands of working people," Elizabeth Warren said. "The changes I've proposed will shift power to working people, boost America's labor movement, and help create an economy that works for everyone."
