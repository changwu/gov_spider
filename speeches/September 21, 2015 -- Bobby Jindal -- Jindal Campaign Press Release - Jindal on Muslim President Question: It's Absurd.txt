    Des Moines, IA - Following questions posed to various Republican Presidential candidates over the weekend, as to whether they would vote for a Muslim for President, Governor Bobby Jindal challenged the press by using their own game against them.
"This is a dumb game that the press is playing. It is an absurd hypothetical question. But let's indulge the media for a moment and play their gotcha game.
"If you can find me a Muslim candidate who is a Republican, who will fight hard to protect religious liberty, who will respect the Judeo-Christian heritage of America, who will be committed to destroying ISIS and radical Islam, who will condemn cultures that treat women as second class citizens and who will place their hand on the Bible and swear to uphold the Constitution, then yes, I will be happy to consider voting for him or her.
"If you can't, I'll settle for voting for a Christian Governor from Louisiana."
