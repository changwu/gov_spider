    The President will participate in the second U.S.-Africa Business Forum, hosted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Bloomberg Philanthropies, on September 21, 2016 in New York City. Building on the progress made during the first U.S.-Africa Business Forum in Washington, D.C. in 2014, the Forum will once again bring together African heads of state and government and U.S. and African CEOs. It will be an opportunity to forge new partnerships to continue to address the continent's most pressing challenges and to build a stronger, more sustainable future for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.
