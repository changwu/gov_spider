    NEW YORK â€” Andrew Yang today unveiled his plan to address care for children and adults with disabilities. Today, 1 in 4 adults has a disability in the U.S., but 1 in 3 people with a disability do not have access to a primary healthcare provider and has unmet healthcare needs due to high costs. Additionally, 13.3 million children in the U.S. live with special healthcare needs.
"As the father of a son with autism, I understand the hardships millions of other American families face everyday," said Andrew Yang. "Children and adults with disabilities need a wide range of medical and long-term services and support that our current healthcare system does not prioritize, and we need to do better by them." Early detection, intervention, and on-going support is critical for parents of children with disabilities to understand and meet their child's needs. Our healthcare system should ensure all families have access to necessary experts and resources that equally uplift our children.
People with disabilities are much more likely to experience secondary complications that exacerbate their medical conditions and often need fast access to hospitals and treatment. Under the current system, these people disproportionately lack the access that they need because of high unemployment and homelessness rates, and higher rates of poverty. Additionally, they may face accessibility challenges at healthcare provider locations and in transportation.
We need to ensure that all people, including children and persons with disabilities, have equal access to the healthcare they need. Outside of ensuring Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance at all healthcare providers and covering transportation costs, technologies such as telehealth will provide new and more convenient ways for persons with disabilities to access preventative care in a format of their choice and at an affordable cost.
