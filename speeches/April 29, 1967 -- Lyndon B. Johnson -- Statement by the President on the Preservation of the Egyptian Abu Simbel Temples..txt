    OVER 3 years ago the United States joined 50 other nations in contributing funds to preserve the great Abu Simbel Temples, in Egypt's Nubia. The construction of the Aswan High Dam had threatened the temples with inundation.
In appreciation for our contribution, the United Arab Republic offered us one of the Nubian monuments--the Temple of Dendur. I have just announced that this temple will be located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The task of saving Abu Simbel is unfinished-$3.5 million more is needed to reassemble the remaining two temples and restore them to a new site. At the suggestion of the State Department, the American Committee to Preserve Abu Simbel was formed, and it has raised approximately $1.3 million in donations and pledges. A balance of $2.2 million remains.
These monuments represent a culmination of nearly 2,000 years of artistic achievement in ancient Egypt. They are a priceless cultural heritage. They must not be lost to mankind.
Americans can participate in saving the temples by contributing to the Committee to Preserve Abu Simbel.
