    Mitt Romney made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's announcement:
"Newt Gingrich has brought creativity and intellectual vitality to American political life.Â  During the course of this campaign, Newt demonstrated both eloquence and fearlessness in advancing conservative ideas. Although he long ago created an enduring place for himself in American history, I am confident that he will continue to make important contributions to our party and to the life of the nation. Ann and I are proud to call Newt and Callista friends and we look forward to working with them in the months and years ahead as we fight to restore America's promise."
