    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Hayworth (R) AZ and eight cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 150, as reported by the Committee on Resources, because the bill would require the Secretary of Agriculture, upon determination that National Forest land would be suitable for educational purposes, to convey the land for less than fair market value. Although the Administration supports making federal land available to local communities under certain circumstances, the Administration objects to any process that would create expectations that acres of National Forest land, far in excess of the needs of local school systems, could be acquired for less than fair market value.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 150 would affect direct spending and, therefore, is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 per year. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
