    During Jeb's eight years as Governor of Florida, there were times he referred to the capital as "Mount Tallahassee" because it seemed so removed from the people and settled in its ways.
For those eight years, Jeb refused to go along with the establishment and be another member of the club, and it made all the difference.
Eight years as Governor and 8 years of hard work led to 8 balanced budgets, 8 years of tax cuts, and 8 billion in new reserves.

Governor Bush delivered results for Tallahassee and the entire State of Florida. He cut the state bureaucracy by 11%, resulting in 13,000 less state government workers.

We need a president who will not defer to the settled ways of "Mount Washington." The overspending, the overreaching, the arrogance and sheer incompetence has been accepted for too long.
It's time to challenge "Mount Washington."
