    Good evening. Laura and I are honored to have you here, and it's a pleasure to be here with a lot of friends. You know, I've developed a unique perspective on this event. For 6 years, I sat and watched the President speak; for 8 years, I was the President and spoke. [Laughter] And next year, I'll be watching on C-SPAN. [Laughter]
I appreciate Tim Pawlenty and Ed Rendell, forâ€”serve as the chair and vice chair of the National Governors Association. I congratulate our two newest Governors, Kentucky's Steve Beshear and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal. I might add, Jindal is not here, but he's ably represented by the first lady of Louisiana, Supriya. And I congratulate Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi for his reelection. I want to thank the Vice President and Lynne Cheney for joining us. I also tell you how thankful I am and honored we are that Vince Gill and Amy Grant have come tonight to entertain us.
I value our Governors because our Governors are some of the Nation's foremost policy entrepreneurs. I appreciate what you do. I appreciate the sacrifice your families have made to serve America.
It was in that spirit that Teddy Roosevelt hosted the first Governors meeting here at the White House 100 years ago. I can't imagine what they were thinking about what America would look like 100 years ago, and I'm not sure what people will think 100 years from now. But I do know it makes sense to put wise policy in place in the meantime so America can remain prosperous and strong and free.
And so tonight it's my honor to welcome you all and to offer a toast to the Nation's Governors.
