    On Friday, August 7, 2015, the President signed into law:
H.R. 1138, the "Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act," which designates three new wilderness areas (encompassing about 275,665 acres) in Idaho as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System; releases four wilderness study areas so that the land would be managed for multiple-use activities; and provides for several land conveyances in Idaho.
