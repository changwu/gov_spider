    Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee Senior Advisor Bill Paxon released the following statement following MSNBC's debate tonight:
"There is one man who can turnaround America's economy and face down the terrorists because he's done it before. Rudy is the only man in this race who has turned around a city in economic crisis by cutting taxes, restraining spending and creating new jobs. Rudy's done it before and he'll do it again as President."
