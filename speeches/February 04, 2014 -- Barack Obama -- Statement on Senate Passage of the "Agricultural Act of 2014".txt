    Today, in a strong bipartisan vote, the U.S. Senate came together to pass a comprehensive farm bill, legislation that will build on the historic economic gains in rural America over the past 5 years, create new jobs and opportunities, and protect the most vulnerable Americans. This bill provides certainty to America's farmers and ranchers and contains a variety of commonsense reforms that my administration has consistently called for, including reforming and eliminating direct farm subsidies and providing assistance for farmers when they need it most. It will continue reducing our deficits without gutting the vital assistance programs millions of hard-working Americans count on to help put food on the table for their families. And it will support conservation of valuable lands, spur the development of renewable energy, and incentivize healthier nutrition for all Americans. As with any compromise, the farm bill isn't perfect, but on the whole, it will make a positive difference not only for the rural economies that grow America's food, but for our Nation.
