    Today, former Congressman Ron Barber and 27 elected and community leaders from across the Copper State announced their endorsement of Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"Following the shooting in Tucson I will never forget the kindness and warmth Joe Biden showed my family and our staff. I worked closely with Joe when he led President Obama's Gun Violence Task Force. As a mental health professional of more than three decades -- I can say Joe gets it. That's why his education plan makes serious investments in school counselors and his plan to end our gun violence epidemic significantly expands investments in mental health services," said former Congressman Ron Barber. "I saw up close and personal Joe's immense compassion, empathy and unwavering desire to solve problems facing American families across the country. On day one he'll be able to get to work and get our country back on track. I'm proud to endorse him."
Barber served in the United States House of Representatives from 2012 to 2015. Prior to that he served as then Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' District Director. For more than three decades he worked in the Arizona Division of Developmental Disabilities.
