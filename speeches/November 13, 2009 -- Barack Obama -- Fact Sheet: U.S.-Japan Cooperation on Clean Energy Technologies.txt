•      Deepening of cooperation in the area of smart grid through such activities as information and experience sharing from demonstration projects, and development of standards;
•      Cooperation on carbon capture and storage including modeling, testing and data sharing for the purpose of prediction and mitigation of the possible risks, and the development of new capture methods, simulation tools and monitoring methods;
•      Strengthened partnership on nuclear energy including on advanced fuel cycle technologies, effective use of existing facilities and enhanced seismic safety technologies, recognizing both countries play an important role in global expansion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a manner ensuring nuclear non-proliferation, safety and security;
•      Enhancement of cooperative research, development and deployment activities in additional areas including basic research, renewables, energy efficient buildings, and next generation vehicles; and
•      Close cooperation on energy issues and the development of joint projects in multilateral frameworks including the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), International Energy Agency (IEA), the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP), the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and especially, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) which Japan chairs in 2010 and the United States in 2011.
