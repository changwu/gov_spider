In-town pool report #1 
POTUS, exiting the South Portico at 9:15, stopped to take questions from reporters about Ukraine.
POTUS said the threat of invasion is "very high." Russia is moving troops and may be engaged in a false flag operation, POTUS said
Q: Do you think Russia will go through with it?
POTUS: "Yes, I do. Not now….in a manner of several days."
Asked if he believes a diplomatic resolution is still possible, POTUS said "yes."
POTUS said he was awaiting a response to his letter to Putin.

In-town pool report #3- full quotes 
Full quotes from Q&A with POTUS before boarding Marine One:
Q: What's the threat of invasion of Ukraine?
POTUS: "It's very high. They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in, number one. Number two, we have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation. Every indication we have is they're prepared to go into Ukraine to attack Ukraine, number one."
"Number two, I've been waiting for a response from Putin to my letter, my response to him. [Sentence here is inaudible in the roar of Marine One. POTUS appears to say something about an embassy receiving a letter.] They're faxing it here — not faxing it. They're just sending it here. I have not read it yet. I cannot comment on it."
Q: Is Russia going through with it?
POTUS: "Yes. My sense is that it will happen within the next several days."
Q: Is there any diplomatic path still available?
POTUS: "Yes there is. [inaudible] That's why I asked Senator — Senator! [Mocking his own error] — Secretary Blinken to go to the United Nations to make his statement today. He'll lay out what that path is. I laid out a path to Putin as well, I think Sunday. [Note: They actually talked on Saturday.] But there is a path. There is a way through this.
Q: Are you going to call Putin?
POTUS: I"m not calling — I have no plans to call Putin.

Travel Pool Report No. 3 - Lorain arrival
The president's motorcade departed the tarmac at 11 a.m.
The early part of the drive was on highways but as we got to more residential sections pockets of people were out waving and holding up cell phones. One man gave a cheers with his coffee, another had a thumbs up.
Pooler counted two men giving us the finger. There was at least one "Let's Go Brandon" sign. A number of signs were illegible.
We're pulling into the Shipyards at 11:37 a.m.
More TK.

The pool did not see President Biden enter the Shipyards.
The program began at 11:54 a.m. with remarks from Lorain's Mayor Jack Bradley.
Rep. Marcy Kaptur began speaking at 11:59 a.m.
The president's speech should start shortly.
Here's a live link to the speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD1KCVTIl1E&feature=youtu.be
I'll send along color.
There are about 80 people in the audience in the converted warehouse that sits along the Black River, just inland of Lake Erie. Signage for today's event touts "Great Lakes Restoration" and the "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law." Attendees, press and staff are wearing masks.

Travel Pool Report No. 5 - Biden speech 
EPA Administrator Michael Regan also warmed up the crowd. He started speaking at 12:10 p.m.
Regan reminded the crowd that the Black River was once nicknamed the "river of fish tumors."
Biden entered at 12:15 p.m.
It seems your pooler overestimated the crowd size as the White House sends along: "In attendance for the President's remarks are approximately 60 invited guests including members of Congress, local elected officials, and labor leaders."
The president received cheers and applause when he dropped the "1 billion" figure for Great Lakes Restoration.
Biden briefly struggled to pronounce the "Maumee" river, asking the crowd for an assist. "I can say Toledo," he joked.
He also gave a hat tip to the state's Republican Sen. Rob Portman. "By the way I grew up in a Senate that really was bipartisan. Senator Portman played an important role in this legislation," the president said.
At the top he talked about how it was a homecoming of sorts for his HUD Director Marcia Fudge, who previously represented parts of Cleveland in Congress. He mentioned his own love of going home to Delaware.
He wrapped at 12:30 p.m.
Biden said he was making a swift exit due to weather en route back to Washington "and there's a little thing going on in Europe right now."

Travel Pool Report No. 6 - correx/Cleveland airport arrival 
First quick correction: the president wrapped his remarks at 12:35 p.m., not 12:30 p.m., your pooler mistyped.
The motorcade pulled out of the Shipyards at 12:43 p.m. The pool did not have eyes on President Biden getting into the Beast.
En route back to the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, co-pooler Sean Sullivan spotted an individual holding up a sign that said, "Unmask U.S. Kids." A trio of protesters were gathered on one corner shouting at the motorcade. Two were flipping us the bird and one man held up a "Don't Tread On Me" flag. Others waved and had phones out.
The weather does look ominous.
The motorcade pulled up to AF1 at 1:21 p.m.
He boarded AF1 at 1:23 p.m.
Wheels up shortly.



February 17, 202214:39

Travel Pool Report No. 7 - JBA arrival 
Air Force One took off at 1:33 p.m.
We were wheels down at JBA at 2:23 p.m. It is now 66 degrees!
Biden walked off AF1 at 2:32 p.m. He saluted and didn't turn toward pool. Several questions about Russia-Ukraine were shouted.
He walked on Marine One at 2:33 p.m.
Marine One lifted off at 2:38 p.m.
Handing it back over to your in-town pooler. Thanks again to WaPo's Sean Sullivan for assisting today.
Have a great day!
