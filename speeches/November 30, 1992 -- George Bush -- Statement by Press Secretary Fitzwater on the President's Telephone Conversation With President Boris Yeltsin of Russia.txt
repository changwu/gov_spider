    The President called President Boris Yeltsin of Russia today on the eve of the Congress of People's Deputies meeting in Moscow. They discussed the situation in Russia and U.S.-Russian relations.
The President reaffirmed to President Yeltsin the strong and unequivocal U.S. support for efforts to promote democracy and economic reform in Russia. The President made it clear that the United States will not waver in its firm support for the Russian Government.
The United States and its Western partners have a unique and historic opportunity to construct a democratic peace in Europe as we approach a new century. Russia is pivotal to that opportunity, and the United States has committed itself to building a new partnership with Russia based on a shared commitment to ending the arms race, cooperation in resolving regional disputes, and strong Western economic support for Russia's reforms. The President supports the continuation of concerted and ambitious Western efforts to assist the Russian people in building a democratic society and in integrating their economy and future with the West. The President therefore believes it is imperative for the United States and other countries to do everything possible to support the Russian Government at this critical time.
