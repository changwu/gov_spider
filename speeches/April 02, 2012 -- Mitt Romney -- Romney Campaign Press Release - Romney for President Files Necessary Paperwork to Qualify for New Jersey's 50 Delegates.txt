    Romney for President today filed the paperwork to qualify for all 50 delegates available in New Jersey's June 5th primary. Governor Chris Christie will be the head of Mitt Romney's at-large delegate slate.
Republican National Committeeman Bill Palatucci made the following statement on Mitt Romney's New Jersey filing:

"The full slate of statewide and congressional district delegates filed today on behalf of Mitt Romney represents an accomplished and diverse group of New Jerseyans. They are not only great representatives of the Republican Party, but also of all New Jerseyans who are strong supporters of Governor Christie's leadership that is turning our state around. I know that my fellow delegates State Party Chairman Sam Raia and National Committeewoman Ginny Haines are looking forward to supporting Mitt Romney at the national convention and helping to build a winning grassroots organization for him in the fall."
