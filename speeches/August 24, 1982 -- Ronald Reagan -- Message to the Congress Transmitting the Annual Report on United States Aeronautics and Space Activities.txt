    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit this report of the nation's progress in space and aeronautics during 1981. The report is provided in accordance with Section 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2476).
In 1981, U.S. commercial and government-owned spacecraft brought important rewards from space. Particularly notable were Voyager 2, which sent close-up photographs of the Saturn planetary system, and new Explorer satellites that studied the sun's interactions with Earth's environment. Communications and weather satellites, both civil and military, furnished improved, ever-expanding daily service.
The reusable Space Shuttle Columbia made its maiden spaceflight in 1981, opening a new era that will enable the nation to take full advantage of the ultimate frontier of space. With the fourth and final orbital test flight now completed, the next flights of Columbia and its sister ships will provide routine operational access to space for scientific exploration, commercial use for economic benefits, national security tasks, and the welfare of mankind.
We can all take pride in these and other accomplishments reported for 1981.
RONALD REAGAN
