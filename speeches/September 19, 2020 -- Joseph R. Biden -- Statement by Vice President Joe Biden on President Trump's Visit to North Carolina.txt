    From calling our veterans and fallen soldiers 'suckers' and 'losers,' to purposefully downplaying coronavirus and failing to keep North Carolina's military families, schools, and communities safe, President Trump has shown North Carolinians that he is unfit to be Commander in Chief. Instead of laying out a clear plan to tackle the pandemic and safely reopen our schools and small businesses, he is backing a lawsuit that would rip health care protections away from 4.1 million North Carolinians with preexisting conditions, even as more than 119,000 North Carolinians have already lost their health coverage under his watch.
North Carolinians are paying the price — with their lives, their health care, and their jobs — for President Trump's inability to do his job. But, they have the power in this election to change course.
I will be a Commander in Chief who always lives up to our most sacred obligation to protect our men and women in uniform, and honors the sacrifice they and their families make. I will bring people together to expand access to health care for working families in North Carolina, tackle this pandemic, and build our economy back better.
