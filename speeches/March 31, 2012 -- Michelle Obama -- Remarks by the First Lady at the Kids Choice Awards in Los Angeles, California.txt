    MRS. OBAMA: Hello everyone! (Applause.) I am so thrilled to be here with all of you tonight.
I'm here because I have always felt an obligation to give back; to lift up others the way that my parents, my teachers and mentors lifted me. And that's something that our next honoree believes too. And it's not just something she talks about, it's how she lives her life.
Taylor Swift may be in the news -- (applause) -- for the award-winning songs and multiplatinum records, but every step of the way she has always made it a point to give back. (Applause.) She's supported children's charities, she's worked to combat bullying, and given over tens of thousands of books to schools and libraries all around the country. (Applause.)
She's given so much of her own money to victims of floods and natural disasters here in the U.S. and around the world. And last year, after deadly tornadoes hit the south, Taylor knew she had to do something about it. (Applause.) So she opened up her last dress rehearsal before she went on tour and gave all the proceeds to tornado victims. And here is how it happened.

MRS. OBAMA: So tonight, it is my great privilege to present Nickelodeon's Big Help Award to someone who has rocketed to the top of the music industry, but still keeps her feet on the ground; someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22 year old can accomplish, and someone who is going to keep making sparks fly for all of us in the years ahead.
Let's all give it up for the one and only Taylor Swift!
