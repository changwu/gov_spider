    The United States condemns in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack in Ankara, Turkey, which has taken innocent lives and injured scores. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those killed and injured as well as to their loved ones. This horrific act is only the most recent of many terrorist attacks perpetrated against the Turkish people. The United States stands together with Turkey, a NATO Ally and valued partner, as we confront the scourge of terrorism.
