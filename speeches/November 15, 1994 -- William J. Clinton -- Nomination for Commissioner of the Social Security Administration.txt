    The President today announced his intention to nominate Shirley S. Chater, Ph.D., the current Commissioner of Social Security, to head the Social Security Administration when it becomes an independent agency next year.
"In the year since she was sworn in as the current Commissioner, Dr. Chater has taken decisive steps to improve service to Americans with disabilities, to streamline the agency and make it more efficient, and to enact high customer service standards for the more than 49 million Americans who receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income benefits," the President said. "I can think of no better person to protect and maintain the administration's commitment to Social Security."
