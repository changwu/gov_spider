    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met virtually today with Taoiseach Micheál Martin of Ireland, upholding a longstanding White House tradition on St. Patrick's Day that symbolizes the deep ties and historic partnership between our countries. The President expressed regret that he and the Taoiseach were unable to meet in person and wished him a speedy recovery. The leaders discussed the coordinated international response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine, including the imposition of significant economic costs on Russia and the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine who are displaced by the conflict. They welcomed the growing trade and investment ties between our countries, as well as our close cooperation on shared global challenges, including through the United Nations Security Council. The leaders also underscored their enduring commitment to the Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast Agreement) and the importance of preserving political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.
After the bilateral meeting, the President attended the traditional St. Patrick's Day Speaker's Lunch on Capitol Hill, hosted by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. In the evening, the President and the First Lady will host at the White House the presentation of the shamrocks, a gesture of friendship and goodwill between the United States and Ireland that dates back to 1952.
