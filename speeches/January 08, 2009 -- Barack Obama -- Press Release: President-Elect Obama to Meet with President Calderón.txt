    WASHINGTON, D.C. - President-elect Barack Obama will meet with Mexico’s President Felipe Calderón on Monday, January 12. The meeting will be in Washington, DC at the Mexican Cultural Institute. There is a long-standing tradition, since 1980, of U.S. presidents meeting with the Mexican president prior to being sworn in to underscore the important relationship between the United States and Mexico. This meeting is in keeping with that tradition.
