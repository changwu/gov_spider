U.S. Facing "Severe Housing Crisis." "The Bush administration is working to combat the country's severe housing crisis but there is no simple solution, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Monday, adding that a correction in the housing market is 'inevitable and necessary.' Paulson said the country was facing an unprecedented wave of 1.8 million subprime mortgages that are scheduled to reset to sharply higher rates over the next two years. He said this raised the threat of a market failure and was the reason the administration brokered a deal with the mortgage industry to freeze certain subprime mortgage rates for five years to allow the housing market to recover."

BACKGROUND:
"If Republicans Have Any Chance Of Having Their Lease Renewed On The White House They Must Adopt And Develop Leaders Like Giuliani — Someone Who Raised One Of The World's Great Cities Out Of Despair And Returned It To The Pride It Earned Over More Than Two Centuries." (Editorial, "Rudy Giuliani Is Out Choice In The GOP," Foster's Daily Democrat, 12/20/07)
Mayor Giuliani Believes America Should Choose Optimism And Strength Over Pessimism And Weakness. "But as I travel across our land, I've begun to hear a murmur that America somehow has lost the ability to achieve great goals. Some good people have come to believe that our country is on the wrong track. Middle class families feel that the American dream may be slipping away. They're worried about the future. They're worried that the future may not be as bright as the past. They're worried that this may be the time where the next generation of Americans doesn't do as well as the last generation. It doesn't have to be that way. We — we, you and I — can decide America's direction. We can determine America's future. After all, that's what an election is all about. So let's decide for optimism, not pessimism; for hope, not despair; for strength, not weakness; for victory, not defeat." (Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Remarks In Tampa, FL. 12/15/07)
