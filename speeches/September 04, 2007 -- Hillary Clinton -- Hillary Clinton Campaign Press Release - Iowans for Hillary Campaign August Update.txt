Re: Iowans for Hillary Campaign August Update
Iowans for Hillary displayed the strength and depth of our organization during August. During the last month, we held 97 County Kickoff organizational meetings, 12 roundtable discussions with local educators and earned the endorsement of two international labor unions, which combined have approximately 11,000 Iowa members and retirees. Hillary continues to gain momentum in Iowa as we enter the Fall. Below is our "By the Numbers" August update.
