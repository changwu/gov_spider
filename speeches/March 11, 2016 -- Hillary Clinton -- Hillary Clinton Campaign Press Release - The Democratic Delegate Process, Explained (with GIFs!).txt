Confused about the Democratic primary process? Hillary Clinton's delegate strategist—known around headquarters as "Delegate Dave"—has you covered.
Here's the bottom line: The primary is a race for delegates.

When voters and caucus-goers go to the polls in each state, they're actually voting to pledge delegates to a particular candidate.
For example, on Tuesday:
That means Bernie Sanders only netted a handful of delegates in Michigan, but Hillary Clinton gained a huge number in Mississippi.
So where does Hillary stand in the race for delegates?
Right now, Hillary Clinton is leading by more than 200 delegates—and it will get harder and harder to catch up to her as the race goes on.
But there's still have plenty of work to do. Hillary needs your help (and your vote) to lock up even more delegates so she can win the nomination and go on to win in November.
