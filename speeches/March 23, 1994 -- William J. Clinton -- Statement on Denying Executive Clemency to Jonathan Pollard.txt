    After personally reviewing the Jonathan Pollard matter, I have decided to deny his application for executive clemency. I make this decision taking into account the recommendation of the Attorney General and the unanimous views of the law enforcement and national security agencies. My decision is based upon the grave nature of his offense and the considerable damage that his actions caused our Nation.
Mr. Pollard's crime is one of the most serious crimes against our country, placing national security secrets of the United States in the hands of another country. I have considered Mr. Pollard's argument that he is deserving of a shorter prison sentence because he spied for a friendly nation. I nevertheless believe that the enormity of Mr. Pollard's crime, the harm his actions caused to our country, and the need to deter every person who might even consider such actions, warrant his continued incarceration.
