I am pleased to announce that our highly respected Ambassador to Germany, @RichardGrenell, will become the Acting Director of National Intelligence.

The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker, the American Family, and the American Dream! https://t.co/GhyS5MD8Q9Retweets: 22175Favorites: 78599

Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!Retweets: 25215Favorites: 136352

.@JRubinBlogger (Jennifer Rubin), the wacko "conservative" of the @washingtonpost, must learn how to spell the name Bloomberg before it is too late & he is gone! https://t.co/a8IBH60sx0Retweets: 8609Favorites: 38168

This is the REAL Mini Mike. He admitted, many times, that he is "a fan of Donald Trump. He's a New York ICON." Thank you Mike! https://t.co/KkqMdVMcdkRetweets: 18615Favorites: 67345

"They say Roger Stone lied to Congress." @CNN OH, I see, but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information, for which almost everyone, other than Crooked Hillary Clinton, goes to jail for a long time), and so did Andy McCabe, who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS?Retweets: 33184Favorites: 114805

John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did, there would be very serious ramifications!Retweets: 29545Favorites: 112222

"I don't think there's any chance whatsoever of Senator Sanders defeating President Trump." Mini Mike Bloomberg. Mini, there's even less chance, especially after watching your debate performance last night, of you winning the Democrat nomination...But I hope you do!Retweets: 21110Favorites: 106712

Could somebody at @foxnews please explain to Trump hater A.B. Stoddard (zero talent!) and @TeamCavuto, that I won every one of my debates, from beginning to end. Check the polls taken immediately after the debates. The debates got me elected. Must be Fox Board Member Paul Ryan!Retweets: 22477Favorites: 89154
