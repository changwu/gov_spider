    Former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez today made the following statement on the July employment report:
"Sadly, today the American people received news of yet another jobs report indicative of the failures of President Obama's economic policies. The July jobs report marks the 42nd straight month that the unemployment rate has been above 8%. The Obama Administration's failed economic policies of over-regulation and tax hikes continue to disproportionately hurt Hispanics, who suffer from 10.3% unemployment â€” even worse than the national rate. Mitt Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will revive our economy, creating 12 million jobs in his first term while restoring the confidence of small business owners and job creators everywhere."
