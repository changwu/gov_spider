"We have to bring order back to our cities, back to our country."

Trump is now hitting Harris' record as a prosecutor.
"What's better slow Joe or sleepy Joe?" POTUS asks. "I go back and forth."
He asks the crowd and they cheer louder for Sleepy Joe.
More quotes from earlier thanks to co-pooler Sebastian Smith:
"we have to straighten out our city, our city's a mess"
(cheers)
"The world will never forget the New York police officers who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11 -- I was there -- many never to return."
"a left wing war on cops"
(Mentions Joe Biden -- to boos.)
"And probably she's a step worse, Kamala." (Boos)
(Rudy Giuliani comes on stage at 6:55 (outlook-data-detector://1) )
"No one will be safe in Biden's America."
"They're ruining your suburbs, they want to ruin it."
"Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importance of vice president…"

"We have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country."

 WH travel pool #14: POTUS finishes remarks 
POTUS finishes remarks at 7:15 pm ET.
Pat Lynch takes the stage to thank the president. Said he thought they'd have to postpone because of the president's brother falling ill but got a call that he'd visit his brother and still attend the event.
"That's where he puts you - New York police officers and family," Lynch said. The crowd cheers.
He presents POTUS a statue of a police officer with one hand on the shoulder of a child and the other holding the flag."
Lynch says not many of these statues are given out.
Some earlier remarks from POTUS...
Says the Biden plan to abolish cash bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.
Now touring his executive order on destroying monuments: "if you get caught ripping down a statue or monument you get 10 years in jail."
"We're gonna give you back your statues. We're going to give you back your status - I hate to say it but it's been taken away," Trump.
"We're gonna give New York a real shot," he said. "I think we have a real chance is winning New York."
(Thanks to Sebastian Smith for additional quotes below):
The wall:
"We can't lose this election, ok? You know we're building a big wall." (chants of build the wall)
"Yeah we're building it. "
Insulting nicknames crowd sourcing:
"What's better, 'Sleepy Joe' or 'Slow Joe'?" he asked.
Shouts for both, so he asks them to cheer for each name separately and "Sleepy Joe' wins.
"That's what I thought!" he says.
"I got all these guys telling me… 'we don't like 'sleepy' because it's rude, we're talking about the president of the United States.' I'll tell you one thing, Putin and Kim Jong Un and president Xi of China they're not sleepy…. We can't have slow, sleepy people dealing with them."
Police violence:
"you're going to have a bad apple… but it may be just a bad apple, we've seen it. But that doesn't mean we're going to close up our police departments."
More on his view that the election will be full of surprise upset wins for him:
"The people that didn't like Trump, the never Trumpers, they're starting to like Trump a lot."

Trump takes the podium again. He thanks the police union and asks Giuliani to say a few words. The crowd begins chanting "Rudy, Rudy."
Says he got credit for bringing down crime more than any other mayor ever anywhere: "but you did it," he said. "I owe you that."
Giuliani now talking about how Americans should stand for the anthem, not kneel.
"They want us to believe that our country was founded by an evil man... that the author of our liberty was an evil man."
"That emancipator was an evil man who won the Civil War was an evil man, because they want to convince enough people who are a hateful country. They teach that in our schools now."
