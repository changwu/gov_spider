    It is with regret that I accept Dr. Kissinger's decision to step down as Chairman of the national commission to investigate the events of September 11, 2001, and the years that led up to that event.
As I stated at the time of his appointment, Dr. Kissinger is one our Nation's most accomplished and respected public servants. I thank him for his willingness to consider serving his country once again. His chairmanship would have provided the insights and analysis the Government needs to understand the methods of our enemies and the nature of the threats we face.
My administration will work quickly to select a new Chairman whose mission will be to uncover every detail and learn every lesson of September 11, even as we act on what we have learned so far to better protect and defend America.
