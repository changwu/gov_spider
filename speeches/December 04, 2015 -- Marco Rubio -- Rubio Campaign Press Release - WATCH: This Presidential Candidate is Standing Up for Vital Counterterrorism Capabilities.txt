PETE HEGSETH: Senator, what does the president need to be doing, as opposed to pointing to guns right now at this time of great uncertainty with Paris and now California, to not just quell the fears but really address this threat?
MARCO RUBIO: We need to rebuild our intelligence capabilities that have been substantially diminished over the last few years because of presidential directives, because of a bill that passed a few months ago that including some Republicans voted for â€” including people running for president. Beyond it, you must destroy ISIS. You have got to be clear that we're at war with ISIS. We're going to destroy their ability to spew propaganda, to put out their online publication, to inspire people to attack us. We are at war with radical apocalyptic jihadists. We need to put an end to their ability to conduct operations or to inspire people to conduct operations. That is why ultimately we must defeat them. They must be defeated in Syria, in Iraq, in Libya, where they put out this propaganda from.
As the threat of ISIS-linked terrorism in the United States continues to grow, Marco has led the fight to give our intelligence community the tools they need to keep us safe.
