    I want to thank the members of the 2016 Chicago bid to get the Olympics. Listen, Mr. Mayor, you and your committee have put together a great plan. It's a plan that will make America proud.
They say that the Olympics will come to Chicago if we're fortunate enough to be selected, but really it's coming to America. And I can't think of a better city to represent the United States than Chicago.
This is a well-thought-out venue. There will be—the athletes will be taken care of. People who will be coming from around the world will find that this good city has got fantastic accommodations and great restaurants. It will be safe.
And so I—this country supports your bid strongly. And our hope is that the judges will take a good look at Chicago and select Chicago for the 2016 Olympics.
Thank you all.
