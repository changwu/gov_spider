    Verona, PA - In video that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney doesn't want conservatives to see, he repeatedly advises that a national healthcare mandate is the best route for our nation. Gov. Romney now claims that his mandate was only right for Massachusetts is not a national fix, but this video proves a very different reality than the one now painted by Gov. Romney.

Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "Gov. Romney's own words and true beliefs will forever keep him from gaining credibility with conservatives or any voter for that matter. If Romney would just admit what everyone already knows, that at his core he's a moderate, people might view him differently. But this isn't about mandates at the state level or mandates at the national level - this is about individual liberty and freedom at every level. And when Gov. Romney had the chance time after time, issue after issue, he sided with Barack Obama and government.
In Ohio, all 88 counties voted against this exact government mandate last year. And now, it is time for them to stand up to it and Governor Romney again this Tuesday."
