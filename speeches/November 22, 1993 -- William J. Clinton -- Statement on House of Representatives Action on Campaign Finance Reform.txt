    Today, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation based on my proposal earlier this year.
The public has made clear that it expects change in the way Washington works and politics is conducted. This legislation is a major step toward ensuring that Government serves the national interest and not narrow interests. It sets up a system of spending limits; it opens up the airwaves to debate; it curbs the role of PAC's; and it bans the use of soft money in Federal elections.
I congratulate the House leadership for their energetic effort to pass this difficult legislation, and I look forward to signing the strongest possible bill when it reaches my desk in its final form. All in all, this is a breakthrough for political reform and a sign that we have heard the American people.
