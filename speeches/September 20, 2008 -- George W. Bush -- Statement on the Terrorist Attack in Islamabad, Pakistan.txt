    I strongly condemn the terrorist bombing in Islamabad that targeted and killed many innocents, including at least one American. I extend condolences to the families of all those killed in this brutal attack.
This bombing, the latest in a series of terrorist attacks, is part of a continuing assault on the people of Pakistan. This attack is a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by Pakistan, the United States, and all those who stand against violent extremism. We will assist Pakistan in confronting this threat and bringing the perpetrators to justice. We will fully support the democratically elected Government of Pakistan and the Pakistani people as they face enormous challenges economically as well as from terrorism.
