    I know I speak for everybody here that we wish the President were standing right here on this beautiful day. I know that if he were here, he would first express his deep appreciation to the American Cancer Society, to Dr. Scanlon, who's president, to Mr. Jonas, his chairman, and the others who do such magnificent work. But today, we here at the White House want to join with the Cancer Society in presenting to Karen Anderson the 1981 Cancer Courage Award. Karen's personal courage in overcoming leukemia—I guess, got it at 18, and now 26 and totally recovered—is a great inspiration. And it shows what research has done. It shows what the Cancer Society has contributed to in such a magnificent way. And we view you, in a sense, as a symbol of victory. The volunteers and the staff of the Cancer Society, by their hard work and commitment, show us also what Americans can do when they work together to tackle tough problems, in this instance, this insidious problem of cancer.
And so, I would simply say good luck on the educational and fund-raising activities planned for Cancer Control Month. My family was hit with leukemia 30 years ago, and I just can't tell you what this magnificent progress means, personally. And I know I express to you, Karen, our congratulations, and I know I speak for the President on this one.
Thank you all very much.
