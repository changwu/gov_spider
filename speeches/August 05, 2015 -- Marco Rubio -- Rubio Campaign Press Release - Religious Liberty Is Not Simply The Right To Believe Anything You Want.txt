Those of us of the Christian faith understand we are called to be Christians in every aspect of our lives and we are called to influence the culture around us.
In the new American Century, we need a president who understands that protecting religious liberty means understanding the Constitutional principles of the right to exercise your faith in every aspect of your life.
If I'm president, we are going to have Supreme Court Justices, who we appoint, that will defend liberty and we're going to have a Justice Department that will protect ALL Americans from discrimination.
