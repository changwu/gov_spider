    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit to the Congress the annual report to be submitted under section 381 (c) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, 42 U.S.C. 6361 (c) (1970).
This report covers the implementing activities undertaken during 1978 by Federal agencies. It includes actions to establish mandatory policies and standards with respect to energy conservation and efficiency for Federal procurement activities along with progress towards developing a 10-year plan for energy conservation in Federally-owned or leased buildings. It also describes programs for carrying out a responsible public education program to encourage energy conservation and efficiency and to promote vanpooling and carpooling arrangements.
