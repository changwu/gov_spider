'I think President Trump is set in his ways because he doesn't see any weakening. I mean look at the joblessness report today. What I'm surprised at is how strong the consumer is. I think the Chinese need it (a deal) more than we do. It's statistical. I just think....Retweets: 12713Favorites: 62381

....that our economy is very strong. If the Fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be then I really wouldn't worry about a recession.' @jimcramer @JoeSquawkRetweets: 10680Favorites: 51045

The Immigration Law Institute's Christopher Hajec says 'The Supreme Court has to look st whether DACA is lawful. What they are looking at now is whether Trump's recision of DACA is lawful. Must consider lawfulness of DACA itself. Looks very odd that President Trump doesn't.....Retweets: 12735Favorites: 54628

....have the discretion to end the program that President Obama began in his discretion. That program was unlawful to begin with. I think it's very unlikely that the SCOTUS is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program. DACA Is unlawful.' .....Retweets: 10964Favorites: 48107

....President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event how can he have the right to sign and I don't have the right to 'unsigned.' Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers.Retweets: 12983Favorites: 53289

DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn't feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!Retweets: 14459Favorites: 60685

I agree with @jimcramer the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn't exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well you can't win them all!Retweets: 10282Favorites: 42351

The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian that in addition to Florida & other states Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn't). Check out maps.....Retweets: 12622Favorites: 59950

....This nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology.
