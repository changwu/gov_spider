"The voters sent a clear message last night. Both parties have to step up and do something about crime as well as gun violence."

He boarded Air Force One at 12:03 pm.
Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will gaggle during the flight. The stream will air on the White House site.

Air Force One touched down at Los Angeles International Airport at 1:36 pm local time.
President Biden exited at 1:50 pm and was greeted on the tarmac by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and California Governor Gavin Newsom and the governor's children.

Garcetti gave Biden a shoulder pat at one point.
Biden boarded Marine One at 1:56 pm with Naomi Biden and Peter Neal behind him.
Pool is wheels up to Dodger Stadium in an Osprey momentarily.
The White House shares the following:

Gavin Newsom, Governor of CaliforniaDutch William Siebel Newsom (age 6)Hunter Siebel Newsom (age 10)Montana Tessa Siebel Newsom (age 11)Brooklynn Siebel Newsom (age 8)Eric Garcetti, Mayor of Los Angeles
During the flight, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan came back to gaggle for about 40 mins.
Some highlights:
On meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro who has made comments casting doubt on the results of his reelection and on President Biden's election,
Sullivan said that there were "no topics off limits in any bilateral the president does including with President Bolsonaro.
Climate "will be an important topic of conversation and we believe it could be an area of progress in the U.S.-Brazil relationship."
On U.S. investments in Latin America comparing to China's open checkbook:
"US has never seen its comparative advantage as leveraging huge numbers of state dollars; rather leveraging all tools available to us."
He said Biden will make financial commitment to IDB invest, the private sector financing arm of the InterAmerican Development Bank, to unlock financing for infrastructure, clean energy, digital
"When you tally … the practical impact of what the summit deliverables from the U.S. will mean for the hemisphere, it is significantly more impactful on the actual lives and livelihoods of people of this region than the kinds of extractive projects that China has been invested in."
On labor pathways announcement:
Sullivan said administration is "not going to pretend like what we announced today is going to solve the whole of the systematic challenge that we have but it will help us make progress."
Asked about President Biden forgoing a press conference: "I dont see the formal press conference issue as a particular litmus test."
Jean-Pierre was asked about Biden's pre-departure statement:
"Is the president giving into right wing narrative about rampant crime that needs to be met with severe punishment, and what does it say about prospect for criminal justice reform that advocate of progressive prosecutions was tossed out?"
Jean-Pierre reiterated Biden's statement that "voters last night delivered a clear message: it's time for both parties to get more serious about fighting crime and gun violence."
"He has never supported Defund the Police. He's been clear about that."
Jean-Pierre said Biden signed an executive order on police reform after taking office and said "criminal justice reform is something that he has supported from the moment that legislators on the Hill started talking about coming together trying to have something to move forward with."
"And again, he signed an executive order on police reform on the measures that we can do from the executive, from the federal side of things, from the White House. Clearly he hasn't given up on that."
Sullivan spoke for roughly 35 mins and Jean-Pierre for about 10 mins. There were no other visitors to the press cabin.
AF1 was wheels up from Andrews at 12:14 pm.
