    I am very disappointed that a minority of the Senate, led by the Republican leadership, has once again voted to preserve the status quo of campaign finance by blocking tough bipartisan campaign finance reform. This comprehensive legislation has been passed by the House, is supported by the majority of the Senate, and is demanded by the American people.
If this minority of Senators continue to block this bill, they must take responsibility for the current campaign finance system, with its soft money and its inadequate disclosure requirements. And by doing so, they would deny the American people the best opportunity in a generation to pass meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform.
In the days to come, I urge the Senate to consider this issue again and give the American people the kind of campaign finance law they deserve.
