    WASHINGTON -- Bernie 2020 announced today that the bargaining unit of the campaign has reached an agreement with management and ratified the first union contract for a presidential campaign in U.S. history. The move comes a day after the campaign unveiled sweeping new guidelines to combat sexual misconduct and discrimination and just two months after a majority of the campaign's bargaining unit employees designated the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 400 to represent them as their exclusive bargaining representative.
"We are proud of our workers and proud to uphold Bernie's commitment to collective bargaining rights and a strong labor movement," said Faiz Shakir, campaign manager. "Together, we have achieved some of the strongest standards for campaign workers in history and set the bar higher for the next generation of campaigners. When Bernie Sanders is in the White House, he will make it easier not harder to join a union and we look forward to running a campaign powered by union workers."
The contract sets unprecedented standards for campaign workers, including:

Pay transparency and a pay equity review process for employees that protects their right to request a review without discrimination, discipline, or being discharged by management


Clearly defined wage scale with opportunity to earn performance raises


Broad coverage for mental health care services


Safe, adequate standards for supporter housing and field offices


An expedient, pro-worker grievance and arbitration process


Robust anti-discrimination policy and comprehensive protections for immigrant and transgender workers


Labor committees of union members to address ongoing working conditions and other issues with management
