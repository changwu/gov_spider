    WASHINGTON — Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, the first and only openly gay member of Congress from New York, released the following statement regarding Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's record on LGBTQ rights. Congressman Maloney has not made an endorsement in the 2020 presidential race.
"I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of anti-LGBTQ discrimination directed against me, my family and our community. Those who have worked actively against equality carry that stain and must be held accountable.
"But I also understand how important it is that we encourage people to admit their error, grow and evolve, as much of the country has done over the last two decades. That is exactly what Tulsi Gabbard has done. She recognized the fault in her past views and the pain she was causing, and she has apologized. She admitted her error and has become a strong ally and close friend in Congress.
"Forgiving our former opponents when they stand with us spreads love and builds our strength. As a community, LGBTQ people should not confuse forgiveness with weakness nor substitute recrimination for healing."
