    Today's vote in the Senate on the Saudi arms sale confirms America's commitment to a security relationship that has served both the United States and Saudi Arabia well over the past 40 years. The United States continues to consider the security and well-being of Saudi Arabia and the stability of the Persian Gulf to be a matter of vital interest. Similarly, our commitment to freedom of navigation in the Gulf remains firm. We are determined to work with the Saudis and other friendly states to achieve our shared goal of peace and stability in the region.
