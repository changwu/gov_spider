    Thank you all. Hal, thanks for the introduction. And I want to thank you all for supporting Ford's Theatre. Laura and I have been coming here now for 8 years to the Ford's Theatre gala, and this is by far the best.
We want to thank our choir and our orchestra and all the fabulous performers for taking time out of your busy schedules to helpâ€”to support this really important part of Washington. And Gatlin is probably saying, of course, I said that for the crowd last year. [Laughter] But no, it really was fantastic. And it's such an uplifting performance and a reminder of what a great President Abraham Lincoln was.
I do want to thank Paul Tetreault for being a really fabulous director of the Ford's Theatre. And I want to thank the gala cochairs and all the people who support the Ford's Theatre. I know you're excited about the opening of the renovated Ford's Theatre in February 2009. Laura and I are excited too. Just send the pictures down to Crawford. [Laughter]
Thanks for a fabulous evening, and God bless.
