    On behalf of the American people, I condemn in the strongest possible terms the murders of Israeli citizens on April 6 and 7 and offer condolences to their families. These brutal slayings of innocent civilians are, like the massacre in Hebron, acts of terrorism aimed at stopping the peace negotiations now underway. The enemies of peace have not hesitated to use violence to achieve their goal. They must not be allowed to succeed.
I call upon all those committed to the cause of peace to redouble their efforts and to condemn unequivocally these crimes. The negotiating process holds the promise of a better future for Israelis and Arabs alike. Prompt agreement and early implementation of the Israel-Palestinian Declaration of Principles and progress on the bilateral negotiating tracks are the best means to realize this goal.
