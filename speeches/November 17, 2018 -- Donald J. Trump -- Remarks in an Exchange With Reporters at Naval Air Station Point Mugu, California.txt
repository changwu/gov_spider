    The President's Meeting With Families of Victims of the November 7 Shooting in Thousand Oaks, CA 
Q. What did you say to the victims?
The President. So we just met with the families of the victims and the first responders. And we met with the police, law enforcement—incredible people.
And the families—what can you say other than, it's so sad to see it. These are great people. Great families. They're torn apart. It's a tragic—that was a tragic event.
We met with some police officers, as you know, these are very brave people to do what they did.
And we just hugged them, and we kissed them and everybody, and it was very warm. It was very warm. It's a safe community. It's supposed to be one of the safest communities, and yet something like that happens. It's very sad.
But it was tragic, and yet, in one way, it was a very beautiful moment. I was with the parents of a young—a very young supporter—a young supporter wearing a Trump shirt and just a terrific young man.
So it was a tough thing to do. This has been a tough day, when you look at all of the death from one place to the next, and then we leave from here. That was a tragic event that took place.
I want to thank you. You stayed with us. This is a long day for you also. I just felt this is something we had to do, and I'm very glad we did it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Gun Violence 
Q. So what do we do about mass shootings in this country? What do we do? Because so many people are looking—even your supporters saying, "What do we do?"
The President. It is a very tough situation. We're working on lots of different things. It's been going on for a long time. It's been going on, I guess, in many respects, for far longer than people want to talk about. But it's a very sad thing to see.
Thank you all very much. I'll see you up here. Thank you.
