    President Bush will host Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda at the White House on March 13, 2006. The Slovak Republic is among America's closest friends and allies, and an active partner in advancing freedom in eastern Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan. As the longest-serving leader in central Europe, Prime Minister Dzurinda has enacted far-reaching pro-growth economic policies and his government has been at the forefront of efforts to promote democracy in the Balkans, Ukraine and Belarus. President Bush looks forward to discussing these and other issues on the transatlantic agenda.
