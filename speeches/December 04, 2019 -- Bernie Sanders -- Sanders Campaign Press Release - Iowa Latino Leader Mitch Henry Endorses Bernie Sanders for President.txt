    DES MOINES -- Mitch Henry, co-founder and board member of the Asian and Latino Coalition, on Wednesday endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president.
"I am endorsing Bernie Sanders because I know that when he is in the White House, he will fight for Latinos and working people everywhere because he always has," Henry said. "His leadership and strength are desperately needed at a time of great division and fear in America. Sen. Sanders sends a loud and clear message that the Latino electorate is hungry for a new type of leadership that stands up to special interests and puts people before politics."
Mitch Henry, listed as one of the Des Moines Register's 50 Most Wanted Democrats, co-founded the Asian and Latino Coalition PAC and currently serves as board member and Communications Director. Henry previously served as LULAC Political Director and Polk County Director for LULAC's Latino Iowa Caucus. He has worked on over two dozen statewide and local political campaigns in Iowa and is a U.S. Navy veteran.
"We are excited to get to work with Mitch over the next 61 days to expand the electorate, turn out Latinos at an historic level and win the Iowa caucus for Bernie Sanders and working people across this state," Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik said. "Mitch knows what it takes to win in Iowa and he will be instrumental in keeping up our strong momentum as we head into the final stretch."
Sanders' campaign has worked to connect Latino voters across Iowa, holding "Unidos con Bernie" organizing events and naming LULAC Iowa State Director Nick Salazar as Bernie 2020 Iowa Co-Chair. The Sanders campaign has announced over 20 endorsements from Latino leaders in Iowa, including prominent community activists Kenia Calderón Cerón, Maria Bribriesco, Manny Galvez and Denise Diaz.
