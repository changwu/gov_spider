    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Rhona Charbonneau, former Chair of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee, has endorsed Mayor Rudy Giuliani for President. Charbonneau also represented Hudson and surrounding communities as a member of the New Hampshire Senate and House of Representatives.
"Rudy will be a great leader for our country and the Republican Party," said Charbonneau. "He is the only candidate in the race who is in a position to change the electoral map next year – and help our Party retain control of the White House. Rudy knows that our real opponents in this race are the Democrats – not fellow Republicans."
Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman, added, "Rhona understands New Hampshire politics as well as anyone. Her endorsement of Mayor Giuliani reflects deep and growing support that Rudy has here in the Granite State." Like Charbonneau, Semprini also is a former state GOP Chair.
