    Chaz Proulx Joins Activists Announcing Their Support today
MANCHESTER, NH â€“ The New Hampshire for Hillary campaign continues to build strong and diverse support throughout the Granite State and today announced the names of 333 Grassroots Activists for Hillary. The announcement comes on the heels of this week's trip to the Granite State where Senator Clinton announced her plans to create jobs for the 21st Century and make college more affordable for America's middle class families.
Chaz Proulx, who grew up in Raymond, is a well-known Democratic activist who worked extensively in grass roots organizing and also works regularly within the New Hampshire Democratic Party structure.
"Hillary's Clinton's policies on all the major issues I care about are intricately thought out and her three decades of public service are unequaled," said Proulx, who works part time as a political and issue advocacy consultant. "She has been a visionary on health care, which tops my personal list of domestic concerns. Iraq, of course, continues to drag our country down in every imaginable way. Hillary Clinton has authored the Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act of 2007. We can't solve the Iraq problem alone and we need Hillary Clinton to be President because she can rebuild credibility worldwide."
A veteran of many political battles, Chaz has worked with everyone from Howard Dean to first time school board candidates. In 2006 he dedicated most of his efforts to Carol Shea Porter's innovative campaign for the U.S. Congress.
"I am honored to have the support of so many dedicated community activists," said Senator Clinton. "I will look to them to share my vision for the country with their friends and neighbors across the Granite State."
The following is a list of 333 community activists from across the state who today announced their support for Hillary Clinton.
