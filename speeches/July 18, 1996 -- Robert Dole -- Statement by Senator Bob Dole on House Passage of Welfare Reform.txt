    Republican President candidate Bob Dole made the following statement today regarding the House of Representatives overwhelming 256 to 170 vote to past major welfare reform legislations.
Thanks to Republican leadership, today American took a giant step toward restoring self-respect and self-reliance to the millions of Americans trapped in our broken welfare system. This legislation offers a strong, effective, bipartisan solution that will given states the freedom and the flexibility to address their unique local needs. I have ever confidence that the Senate will also complete action on a similar tough bill. With today's action, it appears that President Clinton will have one last change to keep his promise on welfare reform. I urge him to heed the counsel of the members of both parties in Congress who helped pass this legislation and to sign it when its reached his desk."
