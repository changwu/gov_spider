    I commend the Congress for reaching agreement on the Fiscal Year 2005 omnibus appropriations bill. This legislation is in keeping with my goal to further strengthen the economy by cutting the budget deficit in half over 5 years. With resources already provided to continue to fight the war on terror and to protect the homeland, we have held to the fiscally responsible limits Congress and I agreed to and still adequately funded our domestic priorities like education, health care, and veterans' programs. This accomplishment would not have been possible without the excellent work of the leadership and Appropriations Committee chairmen of both the House and Senate. I look forward to signing a final bill into law.
