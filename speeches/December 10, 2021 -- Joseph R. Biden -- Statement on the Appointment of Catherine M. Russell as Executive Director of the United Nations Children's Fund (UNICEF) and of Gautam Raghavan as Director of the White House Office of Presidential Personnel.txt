    Ambassador Cathy Russell has been a trusted and indispensable advisor to Jill and me for nearly 30 years. In that time, Jill and I have witnessed—and benefited countless times from—Cathy's leadership, experience, wisdom, and empathy. And it is because of those qualities that I could not be more proud that the U.N. Secretary-General has announced his intent to appoint her as the next Executive Director of UNICEF.
We will miss Cathy. But our loss is UNICEF's gain, because children around the world will lead richer, safer, and healthier lives as a direct result of Cathy's leadership in this new role. As a first-rate public servant, policy expert, and manager who has worked tirelessly to advocate for children and empower women and girls—including as the United States Ambassador for Global Women's Issues in the Obama-Biden Administration—Cathy is exceptionally well prepared to lead UNICEF's critical work on behalf of young people around the world. UNICEF is lucky to have her.
Under Cathy's leadership, the White House Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO) has broken records in both speed and diversity of hiring, working relentlessly to ensure that our Federal Government reflects America and delivers for the American people. I am also pleased that Gautam Raghavan, who has worked in tandem with Cathy from day one, will become PPO's new Director, a seamless transition that will enable us to continue building a Federal workforce that is efficient, effective, dependable, and diverse.
