    President Bush will meet with President Askar Akayev of the Kyrgyz Republic at the White House on September 23, 2002. The Kyrgyz Republic has made major contributions to the global war on terrorism, including provision of the airbase at Manas for use by the international coalition to conduct counterterrorist operations in Afghanistan. As our two countries expand the range of our relationship and deepen our cooperation on critical democratic and free market reforms, we will lay the foundation for a lasting relationship with the Kyrgyz Republic and its people.
