    I commend the Senate for passing today the central element of the down payment plan to cut projected deficits.
I congratulate Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, the Senate Republican leadership, and responsible Senate Democrats for making this victory possible. And for the good of the country, I urge House Members to join their Senate colleagues in moving this package through conference so it can be enacted into law as swiftly as possible.
