Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's (R-CA) announcement that he will sign legislation requiring California pension funds to divest from companies linked to the Iranian regime:
"We need to tighten the screws on Iran. Today's announcement by Governor Schwarzenegger is an important step in isolating a regime that threatens genocide, supports terrorism and defiantly seeks nuclear capabilities. Starting in January at Israel's Herzliya Conference, I have called for our state leaders to take action to divest our public pension funds from Iran. In the months ahead, I hope other leaders will join this effort. We have to send the strongest possible message that the world does not support the Iranian regime's sinister actions."
Background:
Today, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) Announced That He Would Sign Legislation Requiring The State's Pension Funds To Divest From Companies Doing Business In Iran. "As the world watched for news of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in New York, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also happened to be in town, prepared to steal some of the spotlight by announcing that California would sever ties with companies doing business in Iran. Schwarzenegger, who like Ahmadinejad went to New York to address the United Nations, told The Times in a written statement that he would sign legislation requiring California's multibillion-dollar state pension funds to divest from the country."

At The January 2007 Herzliya Conference In Israel, Governor Romney Proposed That State Pension Funds Pursue Strategic Divestment From Companies Doing Business With The Iranian Regime. "In my meetings in Israel this week, I have become aware of a potential US pension system to further isolate the Iranian economy. We should explore a selective disinvestment policy. After a series of briefings here, I actually contacted the Treasurer of my own state of Massachusetts and the Governors of some of the neighboring states to begin this process. They are going to begin meeting today with senior Israeli leaders that are in Boston today." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Seventh Annual Herzliya Conference, Herzliya, Israel, 1/23/07)
