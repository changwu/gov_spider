    We are pleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee today advanced the nomination of Todd Jones to serve as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Despite its crucial role in protecting our communities from dangerous criminals, gun violence, and terrorism, ATF has been without a confirmed director for seven years because Senate Republicans have blocked every nominee regardless of their qualifications. Todd Jones is a uniquely qualified nominee â€“ a former Marine, and current U.S. Attorney, with a proven record of successful leadership at ATF. The Senate has already unanimously confirmed him for the important law enforcement post in which he currently serves, so there's no reason they should hold up his nomination to this post. We urge the full Senate to act swiftly to confirm him and give this vital law enforcement agency all the tools it needs to help keep Americans safe.
