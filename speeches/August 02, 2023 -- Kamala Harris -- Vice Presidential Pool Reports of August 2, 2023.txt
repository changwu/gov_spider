On Wednesday, August 2, Vice President Harris will meet with Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene of Mongolia at the White House. The Vice President will reaffirm the strength of the Strategic Partnership between the United States and Mongolia and will discuss our efforts to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.
As Mongolia has been a democracy and friend for more than three decades, the Vice President and the Prime Minister will underscore the importance of strong democratic institutions and rule of law. The Vice President and the Prime Minister will discuss our economic and commercial relationship, including Mongolia's economic resilience; future cooperation in outer space, including civil and commercial cooperation; addressing the climate crisis; and a range of regional and global issues, including China and Russia.
The Vice President is announcing a series of steps to strengthen the U.S.-Mongolia Strategic Partnership. In particular, our countries will sign an Open Skies Agreement, which will facilitate air services between Mongolia and the United States and expand our commercial partnership and people-to-people ties. And we will expand our support for cultural exchanges and English-language education in Mongolia.
This meeting is part of the Vice President's consistent focus on strengthening our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, in recognition that the Indo-Pacific directly impacts the security and prosperity of the American people. Her work has centered around upholding the international rules-based order, which has come under increasing threat in the region, and strengthening our economic and commercial partnerships throughout the region. As the Vice President has said, "the United States is a proud Pacific power, and we have a vital interest in promoting a region that is open, interconnected, prosperous, secure, and resilient."
The Vice President has been to the Indo-Pacific region 3 times in the past 2 years. In August 2021, she traveled to Singapore and Vietnam; in September 2022 she traveled to Japan and South Korea; and in November 2022 she traveled to Thailand and the Philippines. The Vice President has met with nearly 3 dozen leaders from the Indo-Pacificâ€”including in bilateral meetings in the region and in Washington or at multilateral summits, such as the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington in May 2022, the Pacific Islands Forum in July 2022, or the APEC Leaders Meeting in Bangkok in November 2022.
