    I AM pleased to transmit a Statement of Policy, a Renewable Resources Assessment and the Secretary of Agriculture's proposed Renewable Resources Programs as required by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974.
I have agreed that the general goals recommended by the Secretary are desirable ends and are worthy of our careful consideration. I have further stated that my policy will be to implement the recommended goals in accord with two basic principles--maximizing the Federal budget's contribution to the Nation's welfare and minimizing Government interference with the normal operation of the market. I have also outlined some further work necessary to permit a more comprehensive assessment of the recommended program activities and targets.
I look forward to working with the Congress on these matters in the coming months.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
