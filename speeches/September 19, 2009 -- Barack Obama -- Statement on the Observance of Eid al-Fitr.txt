    As Muslims in the United States and around the world complete the month of Ramadan and celebrate Eid al-Fitr, Michelle and I would like to extend our personal greetings on this joyous occasion.
Eid is a time to celebrate the completion of 30 days and nights of devotion. But even on this festive occasion, Muslims remember those less fortunate, including those impacted by poverty, hunger, conflict, and disease. Throughout the month, Muslim communities collect and distribute zakat al-fitr so that all Muslims are able to participate in this day of celebration. As I said in Cairo, my administration is working to ensure that Muslims are able to fulfill their charitable obligations not just during Ramadan, but throughout the year.
On behalf of the American people, we congratulate Muslims in the United States and around the world on this blessed day. Eid Mubarak.
