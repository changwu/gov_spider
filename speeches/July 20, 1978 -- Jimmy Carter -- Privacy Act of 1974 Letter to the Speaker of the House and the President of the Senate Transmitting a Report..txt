    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
This letter forwards the Third Annual Report of executive branch activities to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974.
The report includes a summary description and assessment of agency activities during calendar year 1977, and a list of agency personal data systems subject to the Act.
The protection of personal privacy is an important priority of the Administration. Accordingly, I am sending copies of this report to the heads of each executive department and agency with instructions that they continue to review and improve the management of personal data within their agency.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
