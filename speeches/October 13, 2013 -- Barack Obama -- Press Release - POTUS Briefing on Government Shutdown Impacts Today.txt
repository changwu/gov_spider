    On background, from a WH official:
The President will receive a briefing later this afternoon from members of his senior staff, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors, about the impact of the government shutdown.
The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York has been forced to cancel this week's classes as a result of the lapse. The Merchant Marine Academy already moved up their fall break originally scheduled to start November 1 to begin October 4. The Merchant Marine Academy is a federal service academy that prepares students to serve America's marine transportation and defense needs. Unlike the other service academies, almost the entirety of the Merchant Marine Academy's faculty and staff are civilians subject to furlough.
