Columbia, SC - South Carolinians have been inundated with push polling that has purposely lied about Fred Thompson and his record while complimenting Mike Huckabee. These dastardly calls are being paid for by Huckabee donors.
The founders of the organization making these falsehoods, Common Sense Issues, held a fundraiser for Huckabee in November. Despite being asked to stop the calls and return all funds raised at that fundraiser, Mike Huckabee continues to stand idly by.
South Carolinians are disgusted by these calls and are demanding Mike Huckabee stop these calls. Link here to see South Carolina voters demanding Mike Huckabee stop lying about Fred Thompson's record: http://fredfile.fred08.com/blog/2008/video-mike -huckabee-stop-the-push-polls/ .
