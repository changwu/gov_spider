Donald Trump went "On The Record" tonight, where he reacted to ESPN and NASCAR cutting ties with him over his controversial remarks.
"It's unbelievable," Trump told Greta Van Susteren. "One was a banquet and one was a golf outing ... The whole thing is crazy."
Trump remarked that "they'll both be back next year as soon as things blow over."
"Why are they coming at me? Because I'm against illegal immigration," Trump stated. "I speak up for the country ... I'm totally opposed to it ... Frankly, people have given me great credit for talking about it. I brought a subject to light."
The 2016 GOP presidential candidate said businesses have bailed on him because "they want to be politically correct."
Van Susteren asked Trump if he will drop out of the race because of the backlash he has received.
"No, I love it. I'm bringing ... lots of different elements that are very important," Trump replied. "We have incompetent leadership, we have leaders that don't know anything about negotiating, we're getting killed by China, we're getting killed by Mexico, we're getting killed by Japan."
He added that "we are a bunch of very very foolishly led people."
"I want to make America great again, that's more important to me than my company," Trump stated. "We will never be great if we keep going like this, we will never be great again as a country."
