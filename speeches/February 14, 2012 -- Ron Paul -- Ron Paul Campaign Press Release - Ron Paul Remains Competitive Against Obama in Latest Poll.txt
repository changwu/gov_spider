LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul remains competitive in a head-to-head matchup against President Barack Obama according to a new PPP poll.
Paul wins 41 percent of the vote to Obama's 49 percent. The Texas Congressman is also within the +/- 3 percent margin of error of fellow GOP contenders Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney who garnered 44 and 42 percent against the President respectively. Paul also does better than Newt Gingrich, who would only win 40 percent against the President according to the poll.
Notably, Paul fares the best against Obama among independent voters, trailing him by one point, well within the margin of error. In the same match up among independents, the President beats Santorum, Romney, and Gingrich by four, nine, and 19 points respectively.
"Ron Paul is the only true conservative in the race who can mount a serious challenge to President Obama," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "The fact that Congressman Paul draws more support from independent voters than all the other GOP candidates in a matchup against Obama proves that he is the one with the best chance to win the White House."
The results are based on a telephone survey conducted February 9th through the 12th with a random sample of 1,200 American voters.
The full results of the poll can be found here.
This comes on the heels of a USA Today/Gallup Poll which showed Paul within the margin of error against President Obama.
