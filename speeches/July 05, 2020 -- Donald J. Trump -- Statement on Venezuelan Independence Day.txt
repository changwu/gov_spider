    Today, on the 209th anniversary of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, the United States reaffirms our solidarity with the people of Venezuela.
The Venezuelan people are suffering under an illegitimate and tyrannical regime intent on destroying democratic institutions, abusing human rights, engaging in rampant corruption, and exploiting the worst economic and humanitarian crisis in recent history.
Yet the United States has great hope for the people of Venezuela. Through their perseverance and courage, Venezuela will attain true independence. My administration will always stand against socialism.
