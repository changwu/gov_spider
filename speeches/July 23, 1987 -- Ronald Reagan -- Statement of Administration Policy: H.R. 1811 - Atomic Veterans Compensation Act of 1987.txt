    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rowland (D) Georgia and 66 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1811, which would, without scientific justification, establish broad presumptions of service connection for disability compensation purposes for certain radiation-induced diseases. Under existing law, veterans with such diseases are already entitled to compensation benefits when service connection is specifically determined, based on sound scientific and medical evidence.
The Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards has concluded that H.R. 1811 does not have a scientific basis, and does not allow for scientific analysis.
If H.R. 1811 were to reach the President's desk, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto.
