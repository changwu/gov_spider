    Today, the United States remembers Forbes journalist and editor Paul Klebnikov, who was murdered 10 years ago in Moscow and whose killers have never been brought to justice. Paul's reporting on official corruption and graft brought an important focus and attention to these challenging issues. We honor his memory by calling for an end to the impunity for crimes against journalists in Russia. The United States supports the efforts of brave journalists in Russia and around the world who expose corruption and abuse of power. The intimidation and murder of journalists is an affront to free and independent media and all who respect democratic values. We urge the Russian government to protect journalists from such attacks and to respect freedom of expression, in accordance with its international obligations.
