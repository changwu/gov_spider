    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5234, which extends the applicability of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000 to certain former spouses of deceased Hmong veterans. This bill will make these widows eligible for the eased naturalization requirements provided by the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000, which I signed into law in May of this year. Many of these widows and their families sacrificed a great deal as their spouses fought in support of the U.S. military during the conflict in Southeast Asia. Many have had to struggle to make a new life in this country, and to raise their families, and despite language and cultural barriers, they have made significant contributions to our Nation. This legislation will help ensure that they become full-fledged citizens in our society.
