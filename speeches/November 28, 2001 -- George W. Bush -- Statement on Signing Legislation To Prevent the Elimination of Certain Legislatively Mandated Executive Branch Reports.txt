    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1042, an Act to prevent the scheduled elimination of certain legislatively mandated executive branch reports. This legislation restores 29 statutory reporting requirements that expired last year, pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995. I sign this legislation in deference to the Congress' determination that the reports are necessary to fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. But I remain concerned that many of the existing statutory reporting requirements impose an excessive burden on executive branch agencies. In particular, I am concerned that some of the reports reinstated by H.R. 1042 are either obsolete or duplicative of other reporting requirements. My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to reduce the burden created by unnecessary statutory reporting requirements through the elimination of these unnecessary requirements, while respecting the oversight responsibilities of the Congress.
