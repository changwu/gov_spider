    "Women have a clear choice in November after four years that have delivered little progress for millions of struggling Americans. President Obama's failed economic policies have left women with fewer jobs, higher poverty, and diminishing opportunities for the next generation. And even inside the Obama White House, women have been left behind. Mitt Romney has a clear record of empowering women — and, as president, will work to build a stronger economy with millions of new jobs to help deliver a real recovery for all Americans." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

In The Obama White House's "Rough-And-Tumble Environment ... Female Staff Members Often Felt Bruised."  "In this rough-and-tumble environment, the book reports, female staff members often felt bruised. At a dinner with Mr. Obama in November 2009, several top female aides — including Anita Dunn, who was the communications director, and Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers — told the president about being talked over in meetings by male colleagues or cut out altogether." (Mark Landler, "Book Details Dissension In Obama Economic Team," The New York Times, 9/15/11)


    "The Notion That Women Have Long Been 'The Heart Of The Obama Organization' Doesn't Necessarily Line Up With The President's Largely Male List Of Political Advisers And Senior Staff." (Alexander Burns, "Women For Obama," Politico, 11/15/11)
  

"Even When Women Are In The Room With Obama, They Are Sometimes Seen But Not Heard." "Even when women are in the room with Obama, they are sometimes seen but not heard.

President Obama Is "Responsible For A Work Atmosphere That Marginalizes And Ignores Women." "Coverage in the Washington Post and a new book by Ron Suskind has focused attention on the frustration of Obama's female advisers. But the problem has been obvious almost since Obama took office. And while the explanations so far have blamed members of the mostly-departed boys club—Robert Gibbs, Rahm Emanuel—Obama himself is responsible for a work atmosphere that marginalizes and ignores women." (Amy Sullivan, "The White House Boys' Club: President Obama Has A Woman Problem," Time, 9/21/11)
An Unnamed High-Ranking Female Official: "The President Has A Real Woman Problem." "'The president has a real woman problem,' an unnamed high-ranking female official told Suskind. 'The idea of the boys' club being just Larry and Rahm isn't really fair. He [Obama] was just as responsible himself.'" (Nia-Malika Henderson and Peter Wallsten, "Book: Women In Obama White House Felt Excluded And Ignored," The Washington Post, 9/16/11)
Former Obama Communications Director Anita Dunn: "This Place Would Be In Court For A Hostile Workplace." (Nia-Malika Henderson, "Book: Women In Obama White House Felt Excluded And Ignored," The Washington Post, 9/16/11)


    Dunn: "It Actually Fit All Of The Classic Legal Requirements For A Genuinely Hostile Workplace To Women."(Nia-Malika Henderson, "Book: Women In Obama White House Felt Excluded And Ignored," The Washington Post, 9/16/11)

"The President Initially Discounted The Complaints He Heard That Women, Particularly On His Economic Team, Were Making." "Some early efforts to elevate women foundered. The first White House communications director, Ellen Moran, departed quickly, after a rocky tenure. Others never quite fit in, or failed to be 'in the jet stream' of the most important events of the day, one official said. According to another official, the president initially discounted the complaints he heard that women, particularly on his economic team, were making." (Peter Wallsten and Anne E. Kornblut, "In Early Obama White House, Female Staffers Felt Frozen Out," The Washington Post, 9/20/11)
