His Excellency
Giovanni Gronchi
President of the Republic of Italy
Rome, Italy
I have followed with close attention the Italian Government's demonstration last week of the practicability of using modern aircraft as sentinels of peace. The lessons to be learned from your government's demonstration of aerial photography over the City of Rome and other Italian centers will be studied with keen interest by all governments interested in achieving a lasting peace.
I congratulate the Italian Government on this significant initiative directed toward the building of international confidence. It is a valuable contribution to public understanding of one essential element of a meaningful disarmament agreement.
