    Chicago, IL- The Obama campaign today announced the launch of Spanish captioning for videos on www.barackobama.com. Obama's campaign, which was the first presidential campaign to make both closed captioning and Spanish captioning videos available online, currently has six videos with Spanish captioning.
"This campaign is about making information accessible and providing tools to all Americans that will enable them to take part in this movement to change this country," said Senator Barack Obama. "Providing Spanish captioning for videos is just a small step that allows us to connect further with people in the online community."
Currently these videos are LIVE at www.barackobama.com/closedcaptioning or www.barackobama.com/espanol/tv/.
The Obama campaign is the first campaign to find solutions to make online video and policy announcements available through closed captioning. During the weeks and months ahead the campaign will make available additional videos in both English and Spanish captioning.
