    I AM pleased to announce the transfer of the 200th Federal property to the people of this Nation through the Legacy of Parks program. Under this program, 43 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have received underutilized Federal lands for park use in the last 19 months.
As a result, 180 communities in this country can now provide their citizens with parks and recreation areas they could not enjoy 4 years ago.
My appreciation goes to the officials of States, cities, and other municipalities who have worked with our Federal officials to develop these parks for local use.
The goal of this Administration is to make available an increasing number of parks and recreation areas to provide for both the physical and spiritual enrichment of all Americans. Through this program we are also insuring that the most sensible use is made of our natural resources.
The establishment of 200 new parks is an accomplishment of which we can be proud. But we will not stop here. The Property Review Board will continue to work closely with Federal agencies as we carry forward our efforts to identify Federal property which can be converted to recreational uses. This Administration is determined that more Americans should be able to share more fully in the natural wealth of our Nation.
