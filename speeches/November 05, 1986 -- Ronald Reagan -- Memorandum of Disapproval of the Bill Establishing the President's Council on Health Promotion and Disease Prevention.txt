    I am withholding my approval of S. 2057, which would establish a President's Council on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.
Many Federal health promotion and disease prevention activities are underway at the Department of Health and Human Services, which has set an ambitious agenda of health promotion and disease prevention goals to be achieved by 1990. I am encouraged by the progress that is being made toward those objectives and the plans which lie ahead. These plans include a national conference in late 1989 or early 1990, and many individual programs such as the Low Birth Weight Prevention Initiative, the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, and the Healthy Older People Public Education Program. Because our Federal commitment to such activities must, and will, continue, a President's Council on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention is not necessary at this time.
