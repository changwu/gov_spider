    The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of the Congress (1) proposed rescissions of portions of appropriations for the Military Establishment available for the fiscal year 1946, amounting to $28,692,772,000, and (2) a proposed provision authorizing certain transfers of appropriated funds.
I plan a continuing review of appropriations for the Military Establishment and will recommend such further adjustments as conditions warrant.
The details of these proposed rescissions and the proposed provision pertaining to existing appropriations are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
