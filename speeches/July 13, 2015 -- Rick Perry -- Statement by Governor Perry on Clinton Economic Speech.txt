    AUSTIN — Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement on Hillary Clinton's economic speech:
"Six years into an economic 'recovery' that has left wages and job creation stagnant across the country, Secretary Clinton is attempting to regift the American people with the same failed economic policies the Obama Administration and Democrats have been pushing for years. Mrs. Clinton talks about increasing wages, but fails to note that a wage doesn't exist without a job. She talks about income inequality, but omits the fact that big government, Democratic policies have actually increased the cost of living for Americans across the country. She talks about raising the minimum wage, but lays out no plan to help Americans who currently earn a wage of zero—because they're not working.
We cannot continue the same warmed-over Democratic talking points and expect different results. There is a proven blueprint for job creation in this country, and it is based on lowering taxes and reining in out of control, bureaucratic red tape. States like Texas — where these policies helped create 1.5 million jobs even during the Great Recession — have created opportunity while keeping the cost of living in check, so every dollar goes further for a hardworking family. Secretary Clinton's speech today proved that a Hillary Clinton presidency will be nothing but the third Obama term — and we already know we can do better than that."
