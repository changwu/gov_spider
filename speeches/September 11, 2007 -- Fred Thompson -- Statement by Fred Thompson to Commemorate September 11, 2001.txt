    McLean, VA-Fred Thompson issued the following statement to commemorate September 11, 2001 and those who lost their lives:
"Six years have passed since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Today is a day to remember those who lost their lives at the hands of radical Islamic terrorists who despise our values and way of life, as well as those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice helping their fellow citizens that tragic day, and defending freedom in the years that have followed.
"We must never forget that America has shed more blood defending freedom here and abroad than all the other countries in the world combined. And it was no different on 9/11. Before the twin towers fell, before the smoke had cleared from the Pentagon, before the brave men and women of Flight 93 had made a stand over Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Americans were fighting back.
"America's heritage of defending freedom has fallen to us. It is a great trust that our generation willingly accepts and must uphold. But the best way we can do that - while honoring the tragic loss of our fellow citizens six years ago today, and in all of the years since - is to make sure our nation continues to stand for freedom, remains strong and united in the face of threats, and secure."
