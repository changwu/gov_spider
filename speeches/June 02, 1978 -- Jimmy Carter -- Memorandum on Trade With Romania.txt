    Presidential Determination No. 78-13
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Renewal of the U.S.-Romanian Agreement on Trade Relations-Finding and Determination under Subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974
Pursuant to the authority vested in me under the Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-618, January 3, 1975; 88 Stat. 1978) (hereinafter "the Act"), I find, pursuant to subsection 405(b) (1) of the Act, that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement on Trade Relations between the United States of America and the Socialist Republic of Romania. I further determine that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are satisfactorily reciprocated by the Socialist Republic of Romania.
This finding and determination shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
