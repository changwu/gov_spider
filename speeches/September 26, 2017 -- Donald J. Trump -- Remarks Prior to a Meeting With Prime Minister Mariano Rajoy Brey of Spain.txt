    President Trump. Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have President Rajoy of Spain. He's somebody highly respected—highly respected—in this country. We have a very, very close relationship with Spain. And, Mr. President, it's an honor to have you in the Oval Office. It's an honor to have you at the White House. And we're going to be discussing trade and other things, and we look forward to doing it. And, Mr. President, thank you very much.
Prime Minister Rajoy. Good morning. Thank you very much. I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the very warm welcome he has extended. You know that bilateral relations between Spain and the United States are excellent. We have excellent economic relations. Trade is growing, and we are the second highest investors in the United States, and the United States is a top investor in Spain.
We belong to NATO, and we have very good cooperation in defense and in the fight against terrorism, and I hope that we will achieve the goal of our meeting, which is to continue to see economic growth, job creation, and to continue to have very good relations between our peoples and to continue promoting democracy and human rights and especially the fight against terrorism.
President Trump. President Rajoy and myself will be speaking outside, and we'll take some questions. I assume you're going to be asking me only about Spain. We love Spain, but they have a lot of other things on their mind, I have to tell you. And again, we have a terrific relationship, and that will continue and be as stronger than ever before.
So I'll see you outside in a little while. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
