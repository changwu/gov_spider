Throughout a lifetime of service, she has expanded the focus of her advocacy and generously lent her talents to issues that confront seniors, women, and consumers. Elly Guggenheimer's indomitable spirit and extraordinary efforts to improve the lives of her fellow citizens have helped to illuminate our common path to a better America.
