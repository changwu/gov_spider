At a small coffee shop in Newton, Iowa, a young mom opened up to Hillary Clinton about a concern that keeps countless parents up at night.
She explained that while she's fortunate enough to be able to stay home with her 4-month-old daughter, most parents in her neighborhood don't have that option. And she's putting her faith in Hillary to do something about it.
It doesn't just hurt families—it holds our economy back. And It's time for that to change.
As Hillary explained, that's why she's fighting for guaranteed paid family leave.
Hillary's plan will guarantee workers—men and women—up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a new child or ill family member. And she'll get it done by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.
The bottom line: We need to make it easier for Americans to balance work and family.
