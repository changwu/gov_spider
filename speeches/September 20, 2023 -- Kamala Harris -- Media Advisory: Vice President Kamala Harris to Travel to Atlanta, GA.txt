    On Tuesday, September 26, Vice President Kamala Harris will continue her "Fight for Our Freedoms" College Tour by participating in a moderated conversation with students from Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, and Morris Brown College – four HBCUs in Atlanta, GA. This campus event will be the fifth stop on the Vice President's month-long college tour.
Vice President Harris's "Fight for Our Freedoms" College Tour is a high-energy national swing to mobilize thousands of young people in the ongoing fight for fundamental freedoms and rights. She is set to visit around a dozen campuses including Hispanic-serving institutions, community colleges, apprenticeship programs, state schools, and additional HBCUs. At each stop, the Vice President will focus on key issues that disproportionately impact young people across America – from reproductive freedom and gun safety to climate action, voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality, mental health, and book bans.
The Vice President's college tour kicked off last week with stops at Hampton University in Virginia and North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro. Yesterday, she was in Berks County, PA at Reading Area Community College and IBEW Local 743 where she spoke with members of an apprenticeship program. The tour is a continuation of her dedicated work to energize, engage, and partner with young people throughout the country. She has already been to 14 college campuses this year after visiting 14 schools in 2022. Vice President Harris also regularly meets with young leaders wherever she goes – from climate leaders in Colorado to gun safety advocates in Virginia.
