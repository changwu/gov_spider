    Events to Commemorate 88 Years Since Women First Voted for President
Oregon for Hillary today announced it will hold 88 Oregon house parties in support of Hillary Clinton for president to commemorate the 88th anniversary of women's suffrage.
The parties will be held May 2-4, and women supporters will discuss why they back Hillary, hear from special guests and get on the phones to encourage others to vote for Hillary.
Betty Roberts, the first female member of the Oregon Court of Appeals and Oregon Supreme Court, will be the honorary host of the events.
"When I was born, women were told we couldn't do so much," Judge Roberts said. "Since then, we have proven the nay-sayers wrong time and time again. It is now time to break the ultimate glass ceiling and elect Hillary Clinton as our first female President."
In 1920, women were able to cast ballots for president for the very first time thanks to ratification of the 19th Amendment. Eighty-eight years later women have the opportunity to help elect the first female president of the United States.
