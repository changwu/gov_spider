    NBC News: Majority of voters oppose Biden impeachment hearings as GOP inquiry begins[Bridget Bowman, 9/28/2023]
House Republicans kick off their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden on Thursday, but a majority of voters do not believe the process should move forward.
In a new national NBC News poll, 56% of registered voters say Congress should not hold hearings to start the process of removing Biden from office, while 39% say it should.
The House Oversight Committee is gathering for its first hearing in the inquiry, which Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced two weeks ago to investigate Biden's ties to his son Hunter's business dealings, probing what McCarthy described as "allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption."
McCarthy's own conference was divided over the impeachment inquiry, and so are voters — who are also, unsurprisingly, divided along party lines when it comes to proceedings aimed at removing Biden from office.
An overwhelming majority of Democrats (88%) oppose the hearings, while 73% of Republicans support them. Six in 10 independents oppose the hearings, and 29% say Congress should move forward with them.
The survey also finds that voter sentiments about impeachment mirror those surrounding possible proceedings to remove President Donald Trump in December 2017, amid the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted at the time found 54% of voters opposed those hearings and 42% supported them.

The national NBC News poll 1,000 registered voters — including 848 contacted by cellphone — was conducted Sept. 15-19. It has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
