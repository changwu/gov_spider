    October 24 marked the beginning of a week devoted to fostering the objectives of disarmament, proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in the Final Document of the Special Session on Disarmament last June.
The United States is committed to balanced, effective, and verifiable arms control and disarmament measures. We are currently engaged in arms control negotiations of unprecedented scope, with the goals of reducing the threat of war and maintaining our national security and that of our allies. These negotiations include the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and talks aimed at a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing, mutual and balanced force reductions (MBFR), and a ban on chemical weapons.
With the support of many other governments of the international community, these efforts give real meaning to Disarmament Week. They are an important contribution to mankind's quest for a peaceful world.
