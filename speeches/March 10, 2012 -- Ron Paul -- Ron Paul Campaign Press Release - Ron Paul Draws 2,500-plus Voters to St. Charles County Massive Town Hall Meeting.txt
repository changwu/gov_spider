ST. LOUIS, Missouri — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted a remarkable 2,500-plus voters at a massive town hall meeting held in St. Charles County, Missouri today.
The standing-room-only St. Charles County Town Hall Meeting with Dr. Paul and thousands of voters took place at 3:00 p.m. CST at Lindenwood University — Hyland Arena, located at 209 S. Kingshighway, St. Charles, MO 63301. Dr. Paul asked the crowd to consider economic and civil liberties as inseparable, a state of affairs that would result in a freer, more prosperous society. He also mentioned aspects of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint that experts say far outpaces the recovery proposals of Dr. Paul's rivals for the Republican nomination for the presidency.
