    Since the beginning of the AIDS pandemic, more than 50 million men, women, and children worldwide have been infected with the HIV virus. Each day, 16,000 more become infected, half of whom are young people under the age of 25.
And while we've made great strides in treating AIDS here at home, there is much more that needs to be done, particularly in the developing world, where AIDS poses our greatest challenge.
Today, on World AIDS Day, and every day, we must join together as a global community to stem the tide of new infection, to care for those who are sick, and to continue our quest for a vaccine and a cure.
