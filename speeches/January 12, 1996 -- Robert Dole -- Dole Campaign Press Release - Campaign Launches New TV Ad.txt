    The Dole for President campaign today announced the launch of a new :30 second TV ad called "Tested." The ad, which challenges the "untested leadership and risky ideas" of GOP candidate Steve Forbes, will begin airing throughout the state of Iowa starting today.
Dole National Campaign Manager Scott Reed said: "Steve Forbes claimed he was getting into this race because of his commitment to ideas, but instead, the has launched the most extensive, most expensive negative ad campaign in memory. The reason he'd rather attack Bob Dole than talk about his ideas is because his ideas are risky and his leadership is untested. His biggest enemy is public scrutiny. So far, Forbes has been given a free ride, but he can't expect the American people to allow those ideas to go unquestioned when he's running for the most important job in the world."
Following is the full text of the ad and additional documentation.
