Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!Retweets: 7130Favorites: 21591

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!Retweets: 13483Favorites: 40081

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!Retweets: 10316Favorites: 29170

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!Retweets: 3778Favorites: 12356

I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.Retweets: 4161Favorites: 10787

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.Retweets: 8368Favorites: 25030

Let's properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren's records to see if she is Native American. I say she's a fraud!Retweets: 6099Favorites: 17917

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton's flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.Retweets: 6806Favorites: 19411
