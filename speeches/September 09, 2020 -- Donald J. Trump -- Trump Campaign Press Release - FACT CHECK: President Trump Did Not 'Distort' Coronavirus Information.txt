    Dr. Fauci says there were no discrepancies between what he told the President and what the President told the public.
As Dr. Anthony Fauci made clear today, President Trump listened to the experts on the coronavirus, took their advice, and relayed the information they discussed to the public without "discrepancies" or "distortion."

DR. FAUCI: "I didn't get any sense that he was distorting anything. In my discussions with him, they were always straightforward about the concerns that we had, we related that to him. And when he would go out, I'd hear him discussing the same sort of things... I have not seen that kind of distortion." 
DR. FAUCI: "He really didn't say anything different than [what] we discussed when we were with him... I didn't really see any discrepancies between what he told us and what we told him and what we ultimately came out publicly and said."

Dr. Fauci also questioned the accuracy of Bob Woodward's book and said he does not recall "at all" the quotes that are attributed to him by others.
While President Trump was leading the nation and responsibly keeping the entire country from panicking, his administration was acting decisively to save lives, instituting unprecedented travel restrictions, overhauling the testing system, and ramping up production and purchasing of critical supplies like PPE and ventilators.
