Boston, MA â€“ Today, U.S. Representative Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement on foreign policy experience in this era of new global threats:
"Senator McCain is an honorable man but his recent attacks on Governor Romney are a stretch. In challenging times, we need a leader who can guide America and chart a course to overcome the threats our country faces today. Governor Romney is the only presidential candidate who has outlined a comprehensive strategy for leading America forward and defeating the global Jihadist threat. He will build a stronger military, develop a new counter-terrorism force and work with our allies and partners around the world to help nations reject Jihadism. Governor Romney is the leader our country needs."
