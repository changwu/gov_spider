    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Designation of Senior Intergovernmental Officials in Federal Agencies
To simplify the procedures of the Federal government and to make its programs more responsive to public needs, I have asked the head of each Federal agency having extensive contact with State and local leaders to designate a senior official for liaison with them in the development of policy. These intergovernmental officials are listed at the end of this notice.
I have also asked the agency heads to ensure that these officials respond to matters referred to them within two weeks. If a problem cannot be solved in this two week period, I have asked that the response indicate a definite plan of action and a timetable for reaching a resolution. State and local governments should, of course, direct their questions about pending applications to the appropriate grants offices and should take reasonable steps to resolve all questions at that level before enlisting the aid of the intergovernmental officials.
Where intergovernmental officials find that a problem raised by a grantee requires a decision by more than one Federal department, it is their responsibility to contact the other agencies to reach a decision. Matters that cannot be resolved at this level will be referred to Under Secretaries.
I invite comments and suggestions for improving this process; these should be sent to my Assistant for Intergovernmental Relations, Jack Watson, at the White House, Washington, D.C. 20500; telephone (202) 456-2335.
This document shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
