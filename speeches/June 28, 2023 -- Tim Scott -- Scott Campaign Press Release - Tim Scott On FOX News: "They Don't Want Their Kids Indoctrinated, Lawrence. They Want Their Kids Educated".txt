Tim Scott: The closest thing to magic in America is a good education. In the bluest county in Maryland, parents are standing up and saying, I want a choice for my kids' education. But the school district says, stay home. We'll tell you what to think about what your kids are gonna be educated. Don't show up at a school board meeting. You're not invited to know your kid's curriculum.
With my administration, we are going to have people who respect parents. The GOP, the Great Opportunity Party, we are the party of parents because we know that parents getting a choice gives kids the best chance to succeed in the greatest nation on God's green earth. They have to be involved – invested in their kids' education. And now all across America, we're hearing blue city, after blue city, after blue district, bow the knee to the teacher's unions until their parents stay home, do not have a voice!
Thank God the coalition is growing of like-minded, value centric parents, who say, I am going to decide what my child learns in the area of education, around sex education, and around education. They don't want CRTs, they want ABCs. They don't want their kids indoctrinated, Lawrence. They want their kids educated. They want to be involved. That's a good thing in America. Let's get everybody involved. Go to votetimscott.com, join the American Revolution, and let's restore opportunity and choice to parents and every single zip code in America. We can do it together.
