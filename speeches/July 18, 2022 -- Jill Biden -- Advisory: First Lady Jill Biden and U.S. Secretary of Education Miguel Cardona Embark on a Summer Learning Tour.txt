    The First Lady and Secretary Cardona to Visit Connecticut, Michigan, and Georgia, Highlight How the American Rescue Plan is Helping Students Recover and Thrive This Summer 
First Lady Jill Biden and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will embark on a tour across the country to highlight how President Biden's American Rescue Plan (ARP) is supporting students in getting caught up through summer learning programs. The First Lady and Secretary Cardona will travel to summer learning and enrichment programs in Connecticut, Michigan, and Georgia, that use funding from the ARP to address the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on students’ academic and mental health needs. These summer learning and enrichment programs work to ensure students have access to academic and mental health resources over the summer, and are ready to succeed when they return to school.
Across the country, communities are using President Biden's American Rescue Plan funds to expand summer learning opportunities and help students recover. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan provided an historic $122 billion in funding to help schools safely reopen and stay open, and address student learning loss and mental health needs.
