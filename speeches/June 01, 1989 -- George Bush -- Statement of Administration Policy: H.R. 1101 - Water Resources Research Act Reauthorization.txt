    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Miller (D) California and 11 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1101. If passed by the House, the Administration will work in the Senate to amend the bill to:

lower the authorization level from $41 million to $5.3 million so Â£hat it is consistent with the President's FY 1990 budget;
maintain the current law's non-Federal matching requirement for section 104 noncompetitive university water research institutes grants (i.e., a two-for-one State/Federal dollar match beginning in FY 1989);
delete the new Reclamation State Research Program. This program is duplicative of existing Federal, State, and academic research programs. Further, it would (1) only apply to a specific geographic area; (2) take scarce funds from existing programs; and (3) be contrary to the cost-sharing requirements of the Other activities performed under this Act; and
eliminate the designation of the Federated States of Micronesia as a State for purposes of receiving grants under this Act. Under the Compact of Free Association, former trust territories that become Freely Associated States receive general assistance grants in lieu of Federal programs that are terminated.
