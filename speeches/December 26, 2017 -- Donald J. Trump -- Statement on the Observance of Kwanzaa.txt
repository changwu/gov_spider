    Today marks the first day of Kwanzaa, a weeklong celebration of African American heritage and culture. Together, let us celebrate during this joyous time the richness of the past and look with hope toward a brighter future. As families and friends join to light the kinara, Melania and I extend our warmest wishes for a joyful holiday season and a prosperous year to come.
