    On Thursday, July 13, 2006, The President declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Virginia and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding during the period of June 23 to July 6, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding in the independent City of Alexandria and the counties of Alleghany, Arlington, Bath, Dickenson, Fairfax, Highland, King George, and Rockbridge.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures for all jurisdictions in the Commonwealth.
R. David Paulison, Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Homeland Security, named Michael E. Bolch as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
