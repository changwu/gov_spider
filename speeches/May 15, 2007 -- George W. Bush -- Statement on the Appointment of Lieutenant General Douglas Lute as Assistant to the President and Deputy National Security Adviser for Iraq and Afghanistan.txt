    I have chosen Lieutenant General Douglas Lute to serve as Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan. General Lute is a tremendously accomplished military leader who understands war and government and knows how to get things done. While serving at Central Command, General Lute played an integral role in implementing combat operation plans in Iraq and Afghanistan, and gained a critical understanding of the challenges we face in the global war on terror. He has already earned the respect and trust of the officials with whom he will be working in his new role.
In his new position, General Lute will be the full-time manager for the implementation and execution of our strategies for Iraq and Afghanistan and will manage the interagency policy development process for these two theaters, working closely with my National Security Adviser, Steve Hadley, members of my Cabinet, and me. Nothing is more important than getting Admiral Fallon, General Petraeus, American commanders in Afghanistan, and Ambassadors Crocker and Wood what they need, and Douglas Lute can make sure that happens quickly and reliably.
