    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€” Senator John Edwards released the following statement today about the recent verdict finding Vice President Cheney's former Chief of Staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby guilty on multiple counts in the CIA leak case.
"Today's verdict in the Libby case is an important step in holding the Administration accountable for its consistent misuse and manipulation of intelligence to further its ideological agenda. But there are serious questions about whether the buck actually stopped with Scooter Libby. The American people deserve to know if Mr. Libby has been made a scapegoat in order to protect anyone else."
