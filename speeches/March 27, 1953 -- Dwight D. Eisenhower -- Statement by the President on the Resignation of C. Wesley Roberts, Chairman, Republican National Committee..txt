    I HAVE just received a letter from C. Wesley Roberts informing me that he is submitting to the Republican National Committee his resignation as National Chairman. He was selected for that post in January by the Republican National Committee, with my concurrence, because of our confidence in his abilities, integrity and character.
A situation involving him has arisen and I have read the forthright public statement concerning it that he has released.
Resignation was decided upon by Mr. Roberts on his own initiative. I believe his decision a wise one. Nevertheless, I should like to express appreciation of the valuable and tireless efforts he has devoted to the Republican Party both during the campaign, and, since January, as Chairman.
