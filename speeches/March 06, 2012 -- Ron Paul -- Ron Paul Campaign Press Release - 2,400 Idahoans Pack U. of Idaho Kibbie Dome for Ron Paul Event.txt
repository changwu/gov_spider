    Second appearance by the only presidential candidate in 30 years demonstrates momentum ahead of 'Super Tuesday' caucus
BOISE, Idaho — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a crowd of 2,400 supporters in Moscow, Idaho today, demonstrating his popularity among voters in the crucial northern region of the Gem State. The crowd gathered expressly for the 12-term Congressman from Texas as he spoke the University of Idaho Kibbie Dome on 1000 Stadium Drive in Moscow at 3:00 p.m. PST. This followed the earlier town hall in Sandpoint, population 7,400, which drew 1,300 voters.
Ron Paul is believed to be the first and only active presidential candidate to have a campaign swing through the region in over three decades, holding two events in Moscow prior to the caucus. The first event had an expected turnout of about 400, with the University of Idaho Student Union Building selected as the venue. With a capacity of only 1,000, 1,200 voters packed the room while over a thousand awaited in a line throughout the building and down the street for a chance to see the 12-term Congressman from Texas.
This event clearly broke the record for turnout in lieu of this being the second such event within the same Latah County city of less than 24,000.
Event organizers noted that Dr. Paul touted provisions of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America' and conversed with supporters and undecided Idaho voters.
Ron Paul surveys the extraordinary turnout of interested voters and supporters.
