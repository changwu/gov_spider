WOODBRIDGE, NJ -- This week the McCain-Palin campaign announced the endorsement of Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter and member of the Democratic National Committee's Platform Committee. In a press conference at the Capitol Hill Club on Wednesday, Rothschild discussed her New Jersey roots and her belief that in America, everything is possible.
"I want to tell you about me for a second," Rothschild told reporters. "I come from Oradell, New Jersey ... [which] was once written about in the New York Times as 'the typical American town ....' We were taught that if we worked hard and played by the rules everything was possible for us in America. And I am living the dream."
She also discussed why she plans to support John McCain for President:
"In an election as important at this, we must choose the candidate who has a proven record of bipartisanship and reforming government, and that's John McCain," Rothschild said. "We can't afford a president who lacks experience and judgment and has never crossed party lines to work for meaningful reform. Amid tough economic times and foreign policy concerns, we need someone who is ready to lead. Although I am a Democrat, I recognize that it's more important to put country ahead of party and that's why I support John McCain."
Rothschild, an attorney and businesswoman, supported Sen. Clinton during the Democratic primaries. She will campaign for Sen. McCain through Election Day.
