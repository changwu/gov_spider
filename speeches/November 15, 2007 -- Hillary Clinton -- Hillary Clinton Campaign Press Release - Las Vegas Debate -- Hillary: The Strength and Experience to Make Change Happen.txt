    Hillary enters tonight's debate with polls showing her in a position of strength.
Attacks from her opponents have not dented Hillary's lead in national polls, as one survey after another shows Hillary with commanding leads on the key questions of who is prepared to be Commander in Chief and who has the best knowledge and experience to be President.
According to a Fox News poll out today, Hillary has expanded her primary lead to 21 points, -- the sixth poll that show her lead either unchanged or increased since the last debate. And in Nevada, the site of tonight's debate, a CNN poll released yesterday shows Hillary leading by 27 points and drawing 51% among Democratic voters.
As her rivals ratchet up their attacks tonight, Hillary will stand her ground and continue to demonstrate that she has the strength and experience to bring about the change this country needs.
On Iraq, Hillary will talk about her three-step plan to get our troops home in the smartest, safest way we can. She'll make it crystal clear that if George Bush won't end this war before he leaves office, as President, she will.
On Iran, she will make clear that we need to prevent President Bush's rush to war while engaging in aggressive diplomacy to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
At home she'll detail her plan to offer quality, affordable health care to every American, move the nation toward energy independence and rebuild the road to the Middle Class.
We expect that our opponents will attack Senator Clinton, and we're prepared for it.
