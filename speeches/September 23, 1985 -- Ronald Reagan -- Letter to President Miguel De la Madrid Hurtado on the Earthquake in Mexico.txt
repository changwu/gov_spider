    Dear Miguel:
On behalf of the American people, Nancy and I want to convey once more to you and the Mexican people our sympathy and support as you struggle mightily with the tremendous tragedy that has befallen Mexico.
It was Nancy's strong desire to travel to Mexico to let your people know of our respect and admiration for Mexico's vigorous response in meeting its great human needs. The resiliency of your citizens is truly extraordinary.
During this time of need, I am confident that the global community will generously respond in supporting Mexican efforts to overcome this tragic earthquake.
You can be sure that the United States will accelerate our efforts in providing appropriate assistance, as identified by the Mexican Government. We stand ready to assist you and the Mexican people as you undertake this heroic effort to relieve the misery wrought by the earthquake. And, beyond your immediate needs, as you formulate your longer term reconstruction plans, we will want to consult with you about how we and other members of the international community can be of help.
Nancy and I will have you, Paloma, and the Mexican people in our prayers in the days ahead.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
