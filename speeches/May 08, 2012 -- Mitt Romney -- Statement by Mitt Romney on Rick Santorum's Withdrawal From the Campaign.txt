    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the announcement by Rick Santorum:
"Senator Santorum ran a spirited race and his commitment to conservatism energized millions of Republicans around the country. The race for the Republican presidential nomination has always been about restoring the promise of America. Senator Santorum and I share an absolute commitment to that goal, just as we share an absolute commitment to reversing the failing policies of the Obama Administration, from its assault on freedom of conscience to its feckless foreign policy. Ann and I extend our sincere gratitude to Karen and Rick for his endorsement, and our continued prayers for the health of their daughter Bella."
