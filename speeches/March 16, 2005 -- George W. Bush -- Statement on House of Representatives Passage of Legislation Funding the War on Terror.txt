    I applaud the House of Representatives for its strong bipartisan support for our troops and for our strategy to win the war on terror. The people of Iraq and Afghanistan are building new democracies and defying the terrorists, and America is standing with them. Both countries are assuming greater responsibility for their own security, which will help our troops return home as quickly as possible with the honor they have earned.
I thank the House for its quick action and look forward to working with the Senate so that all of my top priorities are included in the final legislation.
