    On Friday, August 11, Vice President Harris will return to Chicago, IL to headline Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund's annual Gun Sense University conference in front of thousands of Moms Demand Action members, Student Demand Action volunteers, and survivors of gun violence. During a moderated conversation with Moms Demand Action Executive Director Angela Ferrell-Zabala and Emmy-nominated Actor Jason George, the Vice President will highlight the Biden-Harris administration's historic progress on advancing commonsense gun safety policies and discuss their continued commitment to reducing gun violence in communities across America.
Vice President Harris continues to lead the administration's work to address the epidemic of gun violence. Last year, she fought alongside President Biden to successfully enact the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first significant piece of federal gun safety legislation in three decades. In May, the administration announced more than a dozen additional actions to reduce gun violence. The Vice President continues to call on Congress to renew the assault weapons ban at a time when guns are the leading cause of death for children in America.
