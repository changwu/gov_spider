With just 28 total questions answered in town halls, Hillary Clinton refused to answer the question from a New Hampshire voter on her position on the Keystone Pipeline. Yesterday morning on Fox News' Fox & Friends, Governor Christie called her unwillingness to answer, as a former Secretary of State, "inconceivable" and said his answer is simple, "We build it."
