    Whereas, in my judgment, the public interest requires that Henry Clarke Hill, Warden of the United States Northeastern Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, who, during the month of February, 1939, will reach the retirement age prescribed for automatic separation from the service, applicable to him, be exempted from compulsory retirement for age for a period not in excess of one year from March 1, 1939:
Now, Therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 382, 404 (U.S.C., title 5, sec. 715a), I hereby exempt the said Henry Clarke Hill from compulsory retirement for age for a period not in excess of one year from March 1, 1939.
