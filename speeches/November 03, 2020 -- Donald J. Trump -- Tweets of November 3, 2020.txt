Sleepy Joe Biden has vowed to ABOLISH the American oil and natural gas industries, and BAN fracking. Biden's energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty, from Michigan, to Wisconsin to Arizona to Pennsylvania.  https://t.co/gsFSghkmdM Retweets: 9820Favorites: 45420

A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to extinguish and eradicate your state's auto industry. Biden is a corrupt politician who SOLD OUT Michigan to CHINA. Biden is the living embodiment of the decrepit and depraved political class that got rich bleeding America Dry!Retweets: 22863Favorites: 111115

Joe Biden would increase refugees from terrorist nations by 700%. His plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the entire Midwest into a refugee camp. I am protecting your families and keeping Radical Islamic Terrorists OUT of our Country!Retweets: 27828Favorites: 132113

For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked Black Americans. He called young black men super predators. To every black American: I am asking for your vote. This is your one and only chance to show Sleepy Joe what you think of his decision to attack you, jail you, and betray you!Retweets: 38615Favorites: 184143

Over the next 4 years, we will teach our children to love our Country, honor our history, and always respect our great American Flag—and with God's help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, and the right to KEEP AND BEAR ARMS!  https://t.co/gsFSghkmdM Retweets: 16425Favorites: 75419

The Supreme Court decision on voting in Pennsylvania is a VERY dangerous one. It will allow rampant and unchecked cheating and will undermine our entire systems of laws. It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!Retweets: 0Favorites: 0
