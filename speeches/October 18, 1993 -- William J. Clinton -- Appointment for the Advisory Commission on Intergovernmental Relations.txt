    The President announced his intention to appoint 10 members to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) today. Among them is former Mississippi Governor William Winter, who will serve as ACIR's Chair.
The Commission was created during the 1970's to foster better relations between all levels of government. Its primary functions are to provide an intergovernmental problem-solving forum, policy recommendations for intergovernmental cooperation, identification of emerging issues, information dissemination, and technical and international assistance.
"As a former Governor and State attorney general, I am committed to improving cooperation between governments at all levels," said the President. "When people want something done by the government, they don't care whether it gets done by the county, by the State, or by the Federal Government, they just want the job done. The talented, experienced, and diverse group of people that I am appointing to this commission, with Governor Winter taking the lead, will work to find ways to help public servants at all levels achieve that goal."
The commissioners being appointed are:
William F. Winter, former Governor of Mississippi
Carol Browner, EPA Administrator
Howard Dean, Governor of Vermont
Marcia L. Hale, White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs
Arthur Hamilton, minority leader, Arizona House of Representatives
Michael Leavitt, Governor of Utah
Bob Miller, Governor of Nevada
Gloria Molina, member, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
Richard Riley, Secretary of Education
John Stroger, commissioner of Cook County, IL, and immediate past president of the National Association of Counties
