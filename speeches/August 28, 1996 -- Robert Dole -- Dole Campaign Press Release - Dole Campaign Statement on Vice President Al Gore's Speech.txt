    "New wrapping, same old fruitcake. Tonight the Democrats delivered a defense of the same old, stale status quo wrapped in ritz, glitz and topped with a rhetorical bow. Bill Clinton wants to give America four more years of higher taxes, bigger government, and less opportunity... but we won't let them. Bob Dole won't let them."
"The American people will see through the Democrats' fear tactics and elect the candidates of hope, opportunity, and a better vision for the future -- Bob Dole and Jack Kemp."
