    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Kanjorski - (D) PA)
The Administration supports the goal of providing a longer notice period to Federal employees who are affected by a reduction in force (RIF). The Administration, however, opposes H.R. 1341 because it would establish in statute RIF notification procedures that should be prescribed administratively.
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is taking administrative action tÂ° implement requirements similar to those proposed in H.R. 1341. Specifically, OPM proposed regulations on June 17, 1991, that would provide 60 days written notice for RIFs affecting 50 or more employees as well as increased placement assistance for employees affected by RIFs. The notification requirements in OPM's proposed regulations may be further strengthened by OPM in response to agency, employee, and public comments.
Scoring for the Purpose of Pay-As-You-Go and Discretionary Caps
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA) requires that all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as- you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in an increase in the deficit; and if it does, it must trigger a sequester if it is not fully offset. H.R. 1341 affects a mandatory program and therefore is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. However, OMB's preliminary estimate is that the bill will not increase direct spending and therefore has a zero pay-as-you-go effect.
