    I respect General Joe Ralston's decision to remove his name from consideration as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I am pleased that General Ralston has agreed to Secretary Cohen's request to continue in his current post as Vice Chairman. For 32 years, in war and in peace, General Ralston has served our Nation with uncommon distinction. As Vice Chairman, he is a valued adviser to me, and he has played a key role in the Pentagon's review of its post-cold-war mission. The Joint Chiefs and our country will benefit from his continued service. He is an outstanding officer.
I also welcome Secretary Cohen's action to forthrightly and thoroughly review the military's standards and procedures involving personal conduct. It is essential that our system is reasonable, consistent, and fair for those who serve our country and that it is perceived to be so by the American people.
I look forward to receiving Secretary Cohen's recommendation for the Chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs.
