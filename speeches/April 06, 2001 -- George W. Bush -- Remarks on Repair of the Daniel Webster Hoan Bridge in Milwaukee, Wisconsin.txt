    How are you all today? It's good to be here. I'm pleased to be here with Governor McCallum and the mayor of Milwaukee; Secretary Mineta and Secretary Thompson, former Governor of the great State of Wisconsin.
I'm looking forward to tossing out the first ball today. I haven't decided if I'm going to go with a rising fastball, a splitfinger, or a breaking pitch. [Laughter] But nevertheless, it's going to be a great honor to be there. Miller Park will be a proud part of Milwaukee's landscape.
But there is another key structure that is an important part of the life of this city, the Daniel Webster Hoan Bridge. For the last several months, a lot of effort has gone into helping repair the Hoan Bridge, but the job is not yet complete. So I'm here to tell the good people of Milwaukee that fixing the Hoan Bridge is a priority of my administration.
I've brought along the Secretary of Transportation here to identify the quickest way to rebuild this critical artery for Milwaukee. The Hoan Bridge is eligible for funding from the Department of Transportation. We look forward to partnering with the State of Wisconsin to complete the rebuilding of the Hoan Bridge.
Today Secretary Mineta and I have received an application for Federal funds from the Governor of Wisconsin, and I plan to make this project an important priority. Almost 100,000 people live in areas directly served by the Hoan Bridge, and because of its limited capacity and weight restrictions, many commuters and shippers must find alternate routes. We are committed to helping Wisconsin take care of this problem.
Secretary Mineta and I recognize that maintaining the infrastructure of our cities is a vital role for Government. I'm glad we can be of assistance to the citizens of Wisconsin.
Thank you very much. See you at the ballpark.
