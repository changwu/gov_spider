Colonel Michael Steele says he supports Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich's campaign for the former U.S. House Speaker's ability to take action.
Steele, who retired in 2010 after almost three decades in the U.S. Army and was Company Commander of the U.S. Army Ranger company portrayed in the book and film Black Hawk Down, said this coming year's election is pivotal.
"I believe we have one shot left, the way we vote is the way our nation goes and I think if we screw this up we're not getting another shot at it, we have to pick the right man," he said, adding that he endorses Gingrich's campaign for a change in Washington. "I for one am tired of people talking, and would offer it is time to replace a professional talker in the White House with a professional doer. Newt Gingrich is a professional doer, he gets things done. And we are in a point in our nation's history where we need to get things done."
