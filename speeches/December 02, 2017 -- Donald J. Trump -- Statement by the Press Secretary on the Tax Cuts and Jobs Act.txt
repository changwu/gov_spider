    President Donald J. Trump applauds the Senate for passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  The Senators who voted for these historic tax cuts did a great service to their constituents as they supported putting America first, growing the economy, and rebuilding our great country.  The policies in this bill will cut taxes for hardworking families and put our economy on a path of sustainable economic prosperity and job creation.  We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reclaim America's great destiny. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to fulfill the promise we made to deliver historic tax cuts for the American people by the end of the year.
