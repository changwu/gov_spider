    President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met with senior members of the Administration to discuss initial Federal support for Hurricane Irma preparation, response and recovery, as well as ongoing support for recovery from Hurricane Harvey. President Trump continued to stress his expectation that all departments and agencies stay fully engaged in supporting the Governors of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and other States that may be affected, as well as providing assistance to international partners in the path of the historic storm. His number one priority is saving lives. He reminded everyone that search and rescue efforts will transition to mass care, restoring power and other emergency support functions, providing life-sustaining necessities for the population that sheltered in place, and economic recovery. The President closed the discussion by urging those in the path of the storm to continue to heed the instructions of their State and local officials. The President and Vice President continue to extend their thoughts and prayers to those affected and recognize the many volunteer and faith-based organizations dedicating time and efforts to helping fellow Americans.
