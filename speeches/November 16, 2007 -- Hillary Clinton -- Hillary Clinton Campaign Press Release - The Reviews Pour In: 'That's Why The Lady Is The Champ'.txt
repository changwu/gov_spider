DES MOINES REGISTER'S DAVID YEPSEN - OBAMA 'SEEMED FLUMMOXED...GOT BOOED' AND 'JOHN EDWARDS SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME... HAD A POOR NIGHT.' "They blew it. Barack Obama had only an average night, and on a couple of questions he seemed flummoxed... Moderator Wolf Blitzer underscored Obama's fumbling by reminding him the question 'is sort of available for a yes or no answer.' By contrast, Clinton gave the answer she should have in the last debate: 'No.' Also, Obama got booed... John Edwards should have stayed home... Edwards also had a poor night because for the first time, the differences between his votes as a U.S. senator and his talk now came into clear focus. " [Des Moines Register, 11/15/07 ]
