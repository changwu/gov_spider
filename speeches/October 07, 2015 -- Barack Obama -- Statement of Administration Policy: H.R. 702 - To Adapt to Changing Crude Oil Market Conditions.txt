(House Rules)
(Rep. Barton, R-TX, and 137 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 702, which would remove restrictions on the export of crude oil.
Domestic oil production has grown in recent years, strengthening our economy, supporting new American jobs, and enhancing our energy security. The Administration has taken important steps to support safe and responsible production growth, including actions to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, to protect water quality, and to improve offshore safety in order to protect human lives and the environment from oil spills.
Legislation to remove crude export restrictions is not needed at this time. Rather, Congress should be focusing its efforts on supporting our transition to a low-carbon economy. It could do this through a variety of measures, including ending the billions of dollars a year in Federal subsidies provided to oil companies and instead investing in wind, solar, energy efficiency, and other clean technologies to meet America's energy needs.
If the President were presented with H.R. 702, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
