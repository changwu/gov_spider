Script for "Holiday Wishes":
MAYOR GIULIANI: "There are many things I wish for this holiday season. I wish for peace with strength. Secure borders. A government that spends less than it takes in. Lower taxes for our businesses and families. And I really hope, that all of the presidential candidates can just get along.
SANTA CLAUS: "Ho, ho, ho, ho. I was with you right up until that last one. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho."
MAYOR GIULIANI: "Can't have everything! I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approved this message. Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays!"
