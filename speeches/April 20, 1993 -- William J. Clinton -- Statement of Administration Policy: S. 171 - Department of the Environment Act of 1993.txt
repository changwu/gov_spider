    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/22/93)(Senate)(Glenn (D) Ohio and 24 others)
The Administration strongly supports S. 171. Elevation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to Cabinet status will ensure that environmental issues are an integral part of the domestic policy process. The consideration of environmental concerns is imperative for the sustained success of our Nation's economic, social, and trade policy.
On February 8th, the President announced the creation of the White House Office on Environmental Policy (OEP) to succeed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). The OEP will provide a more effective mechanism for focusing Federal environmental policy. S. 171 is consistent with the President's announcement and provides for the continuity of important functions performed by CEQ.
The provisions of S. 171, together with the creation of the OEP, will substantially improve our ability to respond effectively to environmental and economic challenges facing our Nation.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 171 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that the pay-as-you-go effect is zero.
