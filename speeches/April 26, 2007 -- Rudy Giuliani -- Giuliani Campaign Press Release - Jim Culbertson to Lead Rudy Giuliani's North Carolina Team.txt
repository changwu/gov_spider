    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that Jim Culbertson will serve as the campaign's North Carolina Chairman and Finance Chairman. The announcement came as Mayor Giuliani addressed the Civitas Institute at their annual Conservative Leadership Conference today in Raleigh.
"I'm honored to lead Mayor Giuliani's efforts in the Tar Heel State," Jim Culbertson said. "Mayor Giuliani has the record of achievement conservatives can be proud of and a positive vision for the future that all North Carolinians will respond to. Above all, voters know that when it comes to the most important issues of the day, Giuliani will be a leader, keeping the country on the offense against the terrorists and continuing to grow our economy."
Culbertson, a graduate of the Citadel and a retired U.S. Army Lieutenant, served as the North Carolina Finance Co-Chairman for the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign, and as Finance Chairman during the 2004 campaign. Culbertson also served as a 2005 Bush Inaugural Committee Co-Chairman and as North Carolina Finance Chairman for Senator Elizabeth Dole's 2002 campaign.
"We're happy to have someone with Jim's experience leading our efforts in North Carolina and look forward to an exciting campaign in the State," campaign manager Mike DuHaime said.
