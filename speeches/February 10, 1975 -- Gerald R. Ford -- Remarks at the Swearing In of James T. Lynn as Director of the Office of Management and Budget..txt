    Jim and Mrs. Lynn, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Lynn family, distinguished guests:
It is a great privilege to be here on this occasion. I was looking over Jim's long and very beneficial record, starting back in 1969 as, first, General Counsel of the Department of Commerce and then Under Secretary and subsequently the head of the very, very important Department, Housing and Urban Development. And in each and every case, Jim has done a superb job.
I asked him to leave that responsibility and come over to OMB. And of course, those of us who have worked in the years gone by with the Office of the Budget know that several years ago, the Office of the Budget was expanded and became OMB. We know that Roy Ash did a super job in that new responsibility, and that agency of our Government has a continuing responsibility of great magnitude.
In moving from HUD over to OMB, we all recognize that Jim has got a big pair of shoes to fill. I might say I saw Jim Lynn out at Andrews Air Force [Base] last night, and I could not help but notice that Jim has a big pair of feet. [Laughter] So, I think he will fill those big shoes very adequately. But the Office of OMB is one that works very closely with me and with all of the agencies and all of the departments. We have tried to put together--and I think we have in the White House, in the Administration--a good team, and I think the team will work together. And I can assure everybody that there is no place for any "lonesome ends" as far as this Administration is concerned.
So, Jim is a part of the team in charge of a very vitally important agency of the Federal Government. And so it is my privilege and honor, on this occasion, to participate in the swearing-in ceremony of an outstanding young man who has done extremely well in every responsibility that he has assumed in the Federal Government. And so, Jim, I wish you the best, and I know you have taken a pay cut, but you will make up in energy the loss of compensation.
