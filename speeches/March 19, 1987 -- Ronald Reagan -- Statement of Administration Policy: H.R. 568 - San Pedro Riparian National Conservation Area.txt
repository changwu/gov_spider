    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Kolbe (R) AZ and 3 others)
The administration supports the establishment of the San Pedro Riparian Conservation Area, but must oppose H.R. 568. As the Interior Department testified before the House Interior Committee, the administration could support the bill only if amended to reflect better the principles of multiple use management. Specifically:

— delete the 15-year prohibition on issuing new grazing permits;
— delete the prohibition on mineral and geothetmal resource leasing (the administration agrees that the area should be ciosed to mining);
— relax the restrictions on the use of motorized vehicles to allow off-road use if the management plan required to be developed determines such use is appropriate;
— delete the unnecessarily burdensome reporting requirements in section 6; and
— state that the necessary water rights will be pursued under State water appropriation laws.
