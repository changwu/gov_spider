    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, together with a Protocol of Signature and an exchange of notes, signed at London on June 8, 1972. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty, one of a series of extradition treaties being negotiated by the United States, significantly updates the present extradition relations between the United States and the United Kingdom and adds to the list of extraditable offenses both narcotic offenses, including those involving psychotropic drugs, and aircraft hijacking.
The Treaty will make a significant contribution to the international effort to control narcotics traffic and aircraft hijacking. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
