    Trade Negotiations
Q. Mr. President, what do you hope to accomplish at this first summit meeting?
The President. My spokesperson over there, she has my proxy. [Laughter]
Well, we're off to a good start. We hope to get the Uruguay round going again, and we have very encouraging news on that. We hope we can promote growth in our economies and jobs for our people, all of us do. And I think we will do what we can to support reform in Russia. So there are lots of things—
Q. Do you think there will be success on the Uruguay round, sir?
The President. I certainly hope so. I think there will be an announcement on that later today.
Prime Minister Miyazawa. [Inaudible]—made great headway.
Q. Great headway, did you say, Mr. Prime Minister?
Prime Minister Miyazawa. Yes.
The President. Our people worked almost all night last night. A great advantage for the Americans, since they couldn't sleep anyway. [Laughter]
[At this point, one group of reporters left the room, and another group entered.]
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you have any message-world community as you lead this meeting?
Prime Minister Miyazawa. [Inaudible]—contribute to the prosperity—of the whole world.
[At this point, the second group of reporters left the room, and a third group entered.]
Q. Is there progress on the Japanese trade talks, Mr. President?
The President. They're working hard. I think the big news today will be on the manufacturing goods in the GATT round, and we'll have an announcement about that later today. It will be a big deal for Americans, lots of jobs involved if it works. And we're hopeful.
