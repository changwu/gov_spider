A young Iowa atheist recently asked Marco about why he's talking about his faith on the campaign trail.
Marco's response was moving to believers and non-believers both:

Marco emphasized that we can honor the rights of those who do not believe while simultaneously honoring the rights of Christians:
No one's going to force you to believe in God. But no one's going to force me to stop talking about God.

When confronted by an atheist, Marco Rubio hit it out of the park. https://t.co/fLTFcZHgA1

The questioner liked Marco's answer, too:
I'm satisfied he took the question head on. He didn't try to run away from it or he didn't mock me.

Marco will never hide his faith, and it informs every aspect of his life.
