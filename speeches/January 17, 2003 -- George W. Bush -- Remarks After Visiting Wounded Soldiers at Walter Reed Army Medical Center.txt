    I want to thank the General for—for his hospitality at this remarkable facility, which is full of healers and compassionate people, people who are trained with the very best of skills to take care of people who have been injured badly.
Laura and I have just met with five incredibly brave soldiers, five of America's finest citizens, who have been severely injured in the line of duty. We had a chance to tell them how much we appreciated their service to America, how much we appreciated their loved ones. And we had a chance to see—some wives and a couple of moms who are anxious about—about the fate of the—of their child. And I had a chance to tell both soldier and loved one alike that their service to their country was noble and strong and good. And I appreciate that very much.
Having been here and seeing the care that these troops get is comforting for me and Laura. We are—should and must provide the best care for anybody who is willing to put their life in harm's way. And I can report to the American people that these five soldiers, badly injured in the line of service, are getting the best possible care. And our Government is providing it to them.
I want to thank you all. Have a great weekend, and we'll see you next week.
