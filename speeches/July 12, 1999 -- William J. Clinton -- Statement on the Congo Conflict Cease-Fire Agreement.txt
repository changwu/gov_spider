    I salute the leaders of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC), Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe for their courage and commitment to peace in agreeing to the terms for a cease-fire in the Congo war. The signing of this agreement in Lusaka on July 10 provides hope for the many innocent civilians who have suffered through one of Africa's most dangerous and divisive wars in modern times.
Zambian President Chiluba also deserves special tribute for his role in mediating and facilitating the Lusaka peace talks and for his continuing efforts to urge rebel factions to support the cease-fire agreement. I urge all rebel groups to commit to peace and sign on to this important accord.
We have worked with all parties to encourage the resolution of their differences through dialog and negotiations. We will work closely with our partners in Africa, the international community, and the United Nations to support this agreement. We hope that its full implementation, including the disarming of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, will end the cycle of violence in the region, pave the way for an inclusive democracy in the DROC, and help bring a better life for all the people of central Africa.
