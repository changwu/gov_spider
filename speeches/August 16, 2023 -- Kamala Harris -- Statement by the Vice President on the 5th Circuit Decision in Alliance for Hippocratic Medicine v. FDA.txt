    We strongly disagree with today's decision from the Fifth Circuit in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, which would impose medically unnecessary barriers to safe and effective FDA-approved medication. Despite this ruling, mifepristone remains broadly available due to the Supreme Court's stay.
As I have continually said, this lawsuit is a threat to a woman's freedom to make decisions about her own body and another step towards the ultimate goal of a nationwide abortion ban. It endangers our entire system of drug approval and regulation by undermining the independent, expert judgment of the FDA. Americans across the country should be able look in their medicine cabinets and know that FDA-approved medication prescribed by a doctor will remain available. This decision stands between doctors and their patients.
The Biden-Harris Administration will continue our efforts to protect access to abortion and defend the FDA in the courts. The President and I remain committed to protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own health care.
