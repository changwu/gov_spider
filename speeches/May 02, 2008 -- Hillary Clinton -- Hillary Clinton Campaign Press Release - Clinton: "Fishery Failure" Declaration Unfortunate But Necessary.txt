    Hillary Would Work with Oregon to Restore Salmon Population
Hillary Clinton made tYesterday, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a "fishery failure" for the 2008 salmon fishing season. This is the first step in providing disaster assistance to communities who have been hard hit by the near cancellation of fishing this year. Senator Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the issue:
"For communities along Oregon's South Coast the failure of the fishing season is a devastating reminder of the need to restore the wild salmon population. The Commerce Department is taking the appropriate steps to provide aid for these communities, but that is a short term fix. What really needs to happen is a concerted effort to restore wild salmon stocks to healthy, sustainable, and harvestable surpluses.
"That is why I promised in the Oregon Compact to bring all of Oregon stakeholders together - including environmentalists, farmers, fisherman and tribal leaders - to create a comprehensive plan to bring salmon back. As president, I will do everything possible to make sure there are no 'fishery failures' in the future."
