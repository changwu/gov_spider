    WASHINGTON â€“ Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Sen. Bernie Sanders met Thursday for about one hour at the vice president's residence to discuss critical issues facing the country.
Among the many issues they discussed was the need to address campaign finance reform so that the wealthy and powerful cannot wield undue influence in the political process. They also spoke about the need to extend public education in the United States through college so every young person in America, regardless of income, will be able to get a college education.
"Under the leadership of President Obama and Vice President Biden, this country has come a long way economically since President Bush left office and we we're losing 800,000 jobs every month and the world economy was on the brink of financial collapse," Sanders said. "Nevertheless," he added, "we still have a long way to go to create the kind of economy that works for all Americans and not just the top 1 percent.
"I look forward to working with President Obama and Vice President Biden to tackle some of the major issues facing our country," Sanders said.
