    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of New Mexico and ordered federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding during the period of September 15-26, 2014.
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of Colfax, Eddy, Lea, Lincoln, Otero, San Miguel, Santa Fe, and Sierra.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Nancy M. Casper as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
