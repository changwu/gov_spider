Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to new data showing that our economy grew at an even more anemic pace than originally thought, growing at only 1.0% rather than 1.3% annually.
Sen. Santorum said, "This is just another example that President Obama's economic policies have failed. President Obama needs to change course now before we officially sink into another recession. It's time to lower tax rates and reduce the regulatory burden to incentivize manufacturing jobs back in the U.S. Our country needs to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to our Constitution so markets know we are serious about fiscal sustainability and that we will not fall into the trap far too many European countries find themselves in today."
