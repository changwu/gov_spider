    Campaign has received over 36,000 donations since Governor Inslee's debate appearance last week
Seattle, WA â€“ Today, Inslee for America announced that the campaign has reached their 115,000th unique donor, putting the campaign just 15,000 donors away from reaching the 130,000-donor threshold for the third round of Democratic debates.
New donors have lined up behind Governor Jay Inslee following his highly praised debate performance last week. The campaign has added over 36,000 new donations in just over 8 days.
"Grassroots Democrats want to hear a full discussion of the existential threat of climate change," said Aisling Kerins, Inslee for America campaign manager. "That's why Jay Inslee's campaign is gaining momentum with more than 36,000 new donations in the past week. Governor Inslee is now fewer than 15,000 donors from hitting 130,000. This is a clear sign of the power of the grassroots movement for climate action."
