Pool report 2: Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff visit to Yakima Valley
Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who is touring Central Washington to review the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, started his visit at the Yakama Nation on Tuesday morning.
Emhoff was greeted with a traditional honor song as he arrived to meet with the Yakama Nation Tribal Council in Toppenish, Washington.
Yakama Tribal Chairman Delano Saluskin described the toll the virus has taken on the Yakama Nation, both in terms of lives lost – 49 — and the cultural losses. Saluskin said tribal funeral customs have been curtailed due to COVID restrictions.
"This hurt a lot of people because they were not able to see their loved ones off," Saluskin said.
Emhoff said the administration is sensitive to the effect the pandemic has had on Native communities, particularly with the loss of elders who speak tribal languages.
"This is why President Biden has taken bold, bold steps to address the pandemic," Emhoff said, including the American Recovery Act, which provides $31 billion for assistance to Native communities.
Emhoff also is planning to visit the federal mass vaccination site at State Fair Park in Yakima. The center is a partnership among FEMA, the Yakima Health District, the state Department of Health and the Yakima Valley Office of Emergency Management.
