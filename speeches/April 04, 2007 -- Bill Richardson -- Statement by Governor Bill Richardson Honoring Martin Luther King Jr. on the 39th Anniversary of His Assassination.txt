    Today, on the 39th Anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's assassination, Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement about the slain civil rights activist.
"Today, we remember and honor a great man and a true leader - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.," said Governor Bill Richardson. "Dr. King's selfless dedication and life's work as a civil rights activist has made this country and our world a better place to live. He paved the way for a movement that will never be forgotten and continues today. In memory of his battle against discrimination and his fight for a better America we need to continue to push for equal opportunity, equal housing and equal education in the 21st century. We must never forget his beautiful words "I have a dream". Now, it is up to those of us left behind to continue to carry Dr. King's torch and work towards a society that is rid of hatred and discrimination against all races, ethnicity and religions."
