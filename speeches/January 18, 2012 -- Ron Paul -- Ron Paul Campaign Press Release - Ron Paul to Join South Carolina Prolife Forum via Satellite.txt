COLUMBIA, SC — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul will participate in PersonhoodUSA's inaugural LIVE Presidential ProLife Forum taking place later today, as planned.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas will be in Washington for a House vote on a measure to voice their displeasure at and deny President Obama a $1.2 trillion increase in the federal debt limit. The presidential prolife forum takes place in Greenville, South Carolina. Consequently, Dr. Paul will participate in the presidential prolife forum via satellite.
"Dr. Paul feels he must make sure to once again vote against Obama's debt limit increase, but this forum and the prolife cause are very dear to him. Therefore, he has made arrangements to participate via satellite feed," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"With years of experience as a physician Dr. Paul supports the sanctity of life as a basis for liberty and civility, and as the number-one proponent of constitutionally-limited government he supports curtailing federal spending. He can and will represent both interests, and he will do so well," said Mr. Benton.
Ron Paul is by trade an OB/GYN who personally delivered more than 4,000 babies.
In late December, Dr. Paul signed the PersonhoodUSA Republican Presidential Candidate Pledge and anaddendum clarifying is prolife stance in the context of the Constitution. The Ron Paul campaign also released two path-breaking television ads on concerning the sanctity of life: 'Life' and 'Staying on the Right Path.'
Details of the event are as follows. Time is Eastern.
