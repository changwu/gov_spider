    As we reflect on the third anniversary of the terrible tragedy of the Great East Japan Earthquake, we continue to remember the profound suffering that occurred from this tragic event. March 11 is a solemn day to remember those who lost their lives, and we again offer a message of consolation to their family and friends, and honor the resilience of the citizens of Japan.
As we did in the immediate aftermath, the people of the United States stand side-by-side with our Japanese friends as they continue the long task of rebuilding impacted lives and communities. Our immediate U.S. government assistance of over $100 million, the even larger outpouring of support in the form of private donations from the American people, and the response of over a dozen federal agencies to the tragedy were clear signs of our unwavering and enduring friendship and admiration for the Japanese people. The U.S.- Japan alliance will continue as the bedrock of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific.
As Japan continues to chart its sovereign path forward on the cleanup at the Fukushima site and works to determine the future of their energy economy, the United States stands ready to continue to assist our partners in this daunting, yet indispensable task. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Japan on the third anniversary of this tragedy.
