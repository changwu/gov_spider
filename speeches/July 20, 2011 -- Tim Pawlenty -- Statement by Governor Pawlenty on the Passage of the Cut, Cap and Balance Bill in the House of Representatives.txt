    "I applaud House Republicans for courageously fighting to put an end to our nation's egregious spending and passing the "Cut, Cap and Balance" bill. President Obama and the administration have continued to spend beyond our nation's means amidst a hurting economy and soaring unemployment numbers. The time for temporary fixes has passed; our leaders need to start implementing structural, real reforms to get our budget in check. As governor of Minnesota, I made the often uncomfortable choices necessary to dramatically cut spending and balance every budget when I was governor. Restoring the economy will require similar tough decisions, and today's vote brings us one step closer to real reform."
