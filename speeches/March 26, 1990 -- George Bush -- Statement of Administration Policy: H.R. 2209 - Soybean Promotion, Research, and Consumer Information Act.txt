    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Glickman (D) Kansas and 102 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2209. The procedure for appointing members of the United Soybean Board, however, raises constitutional concerns under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The Department of Justice will seek amendments in the Senate to address these concerns.
