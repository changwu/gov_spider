AUSTIN â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today received the endorsement of former Republican Party of Florida Chairman Van Poole in his campaign for President. Mr. Poole served as a Florida steering Committee Co-Chair for Mitt Romney in 2008, but has decided that Gov. Perry is the candidate Republicans need to take back the White House and get America working again.
"Gov. Perry is the real deal, and having an honest, principled conversation with the American people," said Poole. "Floridians and all Americans appreciate his genuine, straightforward approach. I wholeheartedly support Gov. Perry and look forward to being part of his Sunshine State Army."
"I am honored to have Van's support and look forward to his partnership in our effort to get America working again," said Gov. Perry. "His leadership in both the Florida State Senate and as chairman of the state Republican Party was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the emergence of Republican takeovers in the Florida legislature and executive branch, and will be a tremendous asset to this campaign."
Mr. Poole served as chairman of the Republican Party of Florida from 1989 to 1993. His tenure at the helm of the state party laid the groundwork for the super majorities in the legislature and the cabinet. Mr. Poole served eight years in the Florida House and four years in the Florida Senate as Senate Minority Leader and Pro Tempore leader. He also served in President George H. W. Bush's administration as Executive Chairman of the International Political Leaders Program. Today, Mr. Poole is a Managing Principal of Dutko Poole McKinley, a government affairs company in Tallahassee.
