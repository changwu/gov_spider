    Technically, the President doesn't take much notice of state lines. I have come out here because I wanted to come to the West. But of course the President has the fact that there are state lines brought to his attention quite forcibly by the members of the House and the Senate.
PRESS: Did the Pine Ridge Reservation engagement escape your mind, or is that off?
PRESIDENT: It has not been definitely made. I want to go down and visit one of the Indian Reservations while I am here.
PRESS: HOW about Custer?
PRESIDENT: I think we shall go over there. I am not sure about that. It is a short distance, less than an hour's drive from the Lodge.
PRESS: YOU didn't say you were going to be initiated into a tribe at Deadwood?
PRESIDENT: Just because I belong to one tribe is no reason why I shouldn't belong to another.
PRESS: YOU will join the tribe then, will you?
PRESIDENT: I suppose so.
PRESS: YOU haven't found out your name yet, have you, Mr. President?

I shall of course accept the resignation of Ambassador Sheffield. When he was at White Pine Camp last summer he indicated to me that he didn't wish to remain in Mexico more than three or four months, but he has been willing to stay on until this summer vacation. He is now on leave of absence. ... I don't imagine that a successor will be appointed and qualified for some time.
PRESS: Some months?
PRESIDENT: I didn't say some months. It will be some time, perhaps.
