    Chicago, IL - U.S. Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the Writers Guild strike.
"I stand with the writers. The Guild's demand is a test of whether corporate media corporations are going to give writers a fair share of the wealth their work creates or continue concentrating profits in the hands of their executives. I urge the producers to work with the writers so that everyone can get back to work."
