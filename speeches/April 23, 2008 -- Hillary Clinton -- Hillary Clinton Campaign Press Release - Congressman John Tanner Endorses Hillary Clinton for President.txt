    On the heels of a strong victory in Pennsylvania, Congressman John Tanner today announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President. Tanner represents Tennessee's 8th Congressional District.
"I do not remember a time when our nation has faced the financial peril that confronts all Americans," Congressman Tanner said. "To me, this election is not about politics as usual. I believe nothing less than our financial liberty and economic freedom are at stake.
"In my opinion, the best person to lead this critical effort is Hillary Clinton. Hillary is a smart, pragmatic leader who understands the grave situation our country faces, with a $9 trillion debt, much of which is borrowed from foreign countries. Now, more than ever, our nation needs a leader like Sen. Clinton who can work with others to return to fiscal sanity."
Congressman John Tanner has represented Tennessee's 8th Congressional District since 1989. As a co-founder of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, Tanner is considered to be one of the leading voices in Congress for restoring fiscal responsibility to our nation's government. Tanner serves on the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He also chairs the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Tanner and his wife, Betty Ann, reside in Union City, Tennessee.
"I am honored to have the support of Congressman John Tanner," said Hillary Clinton. "As co-founder of the Blue Dog Coalition, John has spent his career in Congress fighting to eliminate our national debt and restore fiscal soundness to our nation's government. John is known as a common sense, results-oriented leader, and I look forward to having him join me in spreading my message of change and experience across America."
