    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Paul, R-KY)
The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 20, a joint resolution disapproving arms sales to Bahrain. This joint resolution relates to $750 million in Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Bahrain for a weapons package that supports the F-16 Block 70/F-16V Aircraft fleet. This package is intended for the sovereign defense of Bahrain, which is home to U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, the forward-deployed U.S. Marine Central Command, Combined Maritime Force, and more than 17,000 United States citizens. The FMS case at issue will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major non-NATO partner and important security partner in the region. Among other things, Bahrain supports United States activities and priorities related to anti-piracy efforts in the Arabian and Red Seas, and is an important partner in countering Iran's nefarious activities and in countering al-Qa'ida and ISIS throughout the region. By helping to support thousands of jobs across 41 States, this FMS transaction also promotes United States economic security and strengthens our defense industrial base.
S.J. Res. 20 would negatively affect the bilateral relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Bahrain.
If S.J. Res. 20 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto it.
