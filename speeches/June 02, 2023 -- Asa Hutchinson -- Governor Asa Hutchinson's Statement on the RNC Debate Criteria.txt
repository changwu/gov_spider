    DES MOINES, Iowa — Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President as well as a former governor of Arkansas and official in President George W. Bush's administration, released the following statement in regard to the RNC's Republican Presidential Primary Debate Criteria:
"The RNC should have minimal criteria for the debates in the early stages of this campaign. More choices are better. I have always supported the party nominee, but I have never supported a party loyalty oath. The pledge should simply be that you will not run as a third party candidate. The 40,000 donor threshold will keep some candidates from being on the debate stage and benefits candidates who generate online donations through extreme rhetoric and scare tactics. It also deprives the voters in Iowa and other early states of an opportunity to evaluate the entire field of candidates. I do intend to be on the debate stage because it is important." — Gov. Asa Hutchinson
