    I am today with deep regret accepting the resignation of Michael K. Deaver as Deputy Chief of the White House Staff. Mike plans to return to the private sector at a date to be subsequently determined, but in the general time frame of March to May 1985.
Mike has rendered 18 years of loyal and outstanding service to me and to the First Lady both in California and in Washington. Nancy and I will sorely miss him, as will the Nation. He has compiled an outstanding record during his 4 years of service to this administration. Mike has been an excellent public servant, and the Nation is fortunate to have had the benefit of his talent and vision. Much of the success we've enjoyed in the first term is directly attributable to him. His shoes will be difficult to fill, and he leaves with our best wishes and affection.
