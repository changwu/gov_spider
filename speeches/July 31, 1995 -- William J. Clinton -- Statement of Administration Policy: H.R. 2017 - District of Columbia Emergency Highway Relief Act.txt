    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Norton (D) District of Columbia and 6 cosponsors)
The Administration supports the timely enactment of legislation to permit a temporary waiver of the non-Federal share of Highway projects in the District of Columbia. Similar waivers have previously been granted to 26 states.
Accordingly, the Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2017 which, similar to S.1023 as passed by the Senate on July 20th, would permit such a waiver for the District of Columbia during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. This legislation is part of a bipartisan and intergovernmental effort to aid the District in its time of fiscal crisis. It will mean that the District's important infrastructure needs will be addressed, with transportation and employment benefits for the entire Washington metropolitan area.
