    I am pleased to announce today that the Honorable Russell E. Train, Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, will serve as my special representative to the meeting in London this June of the International Whaling Commission.
Mr. Train's participation in this meeting demonstrates the high priority which my Administration attaches to the protection of whales. It is my hope that other governments will also take steps to strengthen the work of the International Whaling Commission. In particular, I hope the delegations to the June meeting will include officials concerned with environmental matters.
My concern for the conservation of whales is widely shared---both throughout the Government and throughout the country. By unanimous votes, both Houses of the United States Congress have passed resolutions urging a i o-year international moratorium on commercial whaling. The Department of the Interior has placed all eight species of great whales on the endangered list. As a result, the United States no longer participates in commercial whaling and does not permit the importation of any whale products.
Our participation in the work of the International Whaling Commission allows us to pursue these same concerns at the international level. Mr. Train will take with him to London my very best wishes for the success of the Commission's endeavors.
