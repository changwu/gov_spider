Something unprecedented just happened: Both the House and the Senate voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood.
Their votes will not change the law. More than 18 million people will not lose the health insurance they gained through the Affordable Care Act. The millions of women who depend on Planned Parenthood for health care will not lose access to lifesaving preventive care, including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, HIV tests, and more.
And that is because there is a Democrat in the White House.
But a year from now, a new president will be sworn in. If that president is a Republican, today's votes would have had a very different outcome—because every single Republican running for president wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood.
He or she would sign the bill and take us back to the days when insurers could charge women more than men for the exact same coverage, or deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions. He or she would deny funding to a trusted health care provider that is often the only place that women can get the critical health services they need.
Republicans would rip away the progress we've made. And there are only two things standing in their way: a Democratic president—and you.
