    Ads target Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas
Today, Biden for President announced two new Spanish language ads and a Univision Noticias homepage takeover that comes on the heels of a Republican convention that was filled with empty rhetoric and no solutions for Latino families. The new ads highlight how much the Latino community has suffered under the Trump Administration. The ads include music by Bad Bunny and Alejandro Fernandez, and highlight a series of images spanning four years of Trump's failed leadership.
"Decepciones" will air on television, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and digital platforms such as Univision, Vevo and HCode in Arizona and on YouTube in Texas. The ad showcases a heartbreak song by Alejandro Fernandez that displays various images of Trump, his failed policies and direct quotes from when Trump let down the community.
In Florida and Pennsylvania, "Pero Ya No" will air on television and YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and digital platforms such as Univision, Vevo and HCode. The ad contrasts images of previous Trump support with images showing every reason why Latinos can no longer support Trump. The ad is also linked to a Univision Noticias homepage takeover that highlights #RompeConTrump, which translates to "break up with Trump."



Above is an example of the Univision.com digital takeover.
 The ads are part of the Biden for President's ongoing paid media program across television, radio, and digital, with $26 million being spent this week.
