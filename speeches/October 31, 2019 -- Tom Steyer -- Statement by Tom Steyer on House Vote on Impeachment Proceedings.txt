    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 31, 2019) — Today, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer released this statement following the U.S. House of Representatives' vote to formalize impeachment proceedings and outline the rules for holding public hearings:
"Today's House vote marks another significant step forward in restoring trust in our democracy and delivering transparency to the American people. I applaud the members of Congress who stood up to do their duty. This has always been about doing what's right and putting the country first. When our elected officials and institutions work to protect our democracy rather than work to protect a lawless president, the American people win.
"In this country, no one should be above the law. That is why over two years ago, I started a grassroots movement dedicated to holding Donald Trump accountable. And the American people have made their voices heard — over 8.3 million Americans have signed our petition to impeach this president. Today we take a patriotic step toward preserving our democracy and the rule of law. I am confident that holding public hearings and showing the people the facts will force Republicans to listen to their constituents and vote to remove Donald Trump from office. Only then will we be able to restore our confidence in Congress and move our country forward together."
