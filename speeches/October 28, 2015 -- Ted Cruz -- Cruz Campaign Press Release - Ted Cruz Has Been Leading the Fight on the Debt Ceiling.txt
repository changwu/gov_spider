    BOULDER, Colo. — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to stop the corruption in Washington and force the Washington Cartel to listen to the American people.
Since even before he was sworn in as a Texas Senator, Cruz has been trying to use the debt ceiling as a way to limit increasing the debt for future generations. In 2013 Cruz argued:
"The debt ceiling historically has been among the best leverage that Congress has to rein in the executive," Mr. Cruz, Texas Republican, said on CNN's "State of the Union."
"Since 1978, we've raised the debt ceiling 55 times. A majority of those times — 28 times — Congress has attached very specific and stringent requirements," he said. "Many of the most significant spending restraints — things like Gramm-Rudman, things like sequestration — came through the debt ceiling. So the president's demand to jack up the nation's credit card, with no limits, no constraints, it's not reasonable to me."
