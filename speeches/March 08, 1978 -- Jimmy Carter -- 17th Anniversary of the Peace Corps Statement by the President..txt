    Seventeen years ago this month, President Kennedy signed the Executive order that created the Peace Corps. Since then, tens of thousands of volunteers have worked in the developing world, serving their host countries and serving this Nation as well.
Thirteen years ago, the first VISTA volunteers began their work in the poorest and most isolated communities in our Nation.
The spirit of Peace Corps and VISTA springs from the deepest wells in our cub ture, from the reasoned and strongly felt impulses of our people to share with their neighbors their caring and their labor. Peace Corps and VISTA and the thousands of other voluntary associations in this country are our greatest human resource in the effort to provide for the human needs of our neighbors on this Earth.
These associations of volunteers, including the Peace Corps and VISTA, represent our best offering to communities across the Nation and around the world.
I ask the American people to join me in commemoration of the thousands of our citizens of all ages who have served in these and similar programs, and call upon you to support the voluntary efforts which are so important both to our own Nation and the rest of the world.
