MITT ROMNEY: "Now, by the way, yesterday I raised some questions about Benghazi and the tragedy that occurred there. And there were more questions that came out of last night because the Vice President directly contradicted the sworn testimony of State Department officials. He's doubling down on denial. And we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just have people brush this aside. When the Vice President of the United States directly contradicts the testimony—sworn testimony—of State Department officials, American citizens have a right to know just what's going on. And we're going to find out. And this is a time for us to make sure we do find out."
