LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has launched a major effort to mobilize grassroots opposition to a deal on the debt ceiling that is rumored to be in the works between the Obama administration and House Republican leaders.
"The fact is, Republicans were put back in power during the last election to stop the runaway spending in Washington, D.C.—not to cut "deals" that increase taxes and spending," said Paul.
"If Republicans cave on their Tea Party mandate now, I believe they will pay a severe price at the ballot box in 2012, and I also think that President Obama believes the same. That is why he is pushing for this deal, but Republicans should not fall for it."
Congressman Paul is leading the nationwide push urging people to contact Congress and tell them not to go for the purported deal. The effort began over the weekend by Paul contacting hundreds of thousands of supporters from his email list, and is expanding this morning with millions being contacted via email and social media. By late Monday there will be internet advertising up, and radio and TV ads are planned for later this week.
"Nothing is more important than mobilizing a grassroots army to stop this sellout of conservative principles by the Washington establishment of both parties. And it is vital that Congress hears from the people, loud and clear, that they cannot support more of the same reckless spending and government overreach they were sent to Washington to end," continued Paul.
"We may be just days away from a betrayal of the voters' trust, and we could end up with no balanced budget amendment and no real spending cuts, and a deal that puts an even greater burden on the American taxpayers. But I refuse to stand by without fighting it."
