    Laura and I know it's a privilege to be able to cast our vote, and I encourage all Americans to vote today.
We live in a free society, and our Government is only as good as the willingness of our people to participate in it. And therefore, no matter what your party affiliation or if you don't have a party affiliation, do your duty: Cast your ballot, and let your voice be heard. So we thank you for being a good citizen. It's good to be here voting in Texas. We're going to be heading back up to Washington here pretty soon and watch the results.
Appreciate it. Thank you all.
