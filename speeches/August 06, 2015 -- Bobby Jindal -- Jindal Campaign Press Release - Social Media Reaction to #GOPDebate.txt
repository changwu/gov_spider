    We saw plenty of smooth talking and famous names running for President, but only one candidate in the race has the backbone, the bandwidth and the experience to get the job done as President — Governor Jindal.
Fiorina & Jindal did well and could be on the big stage. I don't think anyone else made that case.

Really liked Jindal's Medicaid answer. Specific and substantive. I'm...skeptical that Pataki would've passed on expansion. #GOPDebate

Usual, Jindal substantive.
