    The President has appointed Ambassador James Leonard as Deputy to Ambassador Robert Strauss for the negotiations on the West Bank and Gaza. Ambassador Leonard, who had planned to retire from his present position as Deputy U.S. Representative to the U.N. this summer, has agreed to defer his retirement. He will attend the opening of the negotiations with Secretary Vance and lead the U.S. delegation at the talks following the Secretary's departure. He will begin working immediately with Ambassador Strauss on all aspects of the American participation in the negotiations. The President, Secretary Vance, and Ambassador Strauss are delighted to have a man of Ambassador Leonard's experience and background undertake these negotiations.
