    Q. Gentlemen, do you think you will be able to agree on new steps toward peace today? President Asad?
President Asad. We hope so. If we don't have this desire, we wouldn't have any incentive for such a meeting. And so the peace process needs efforts, and it always has its own difficulties. People think that with a magic word they might be able to achieve peace, but this is not possible.
President Clinton. Thank you. We're working hard.
