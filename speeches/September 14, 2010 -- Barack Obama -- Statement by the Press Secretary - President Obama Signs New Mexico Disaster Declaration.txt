    On September 13, 2010, the President declared a major disaster exists in the State of New Mexico and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding during the period of July 25 to August 9, 2010.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in Cibola, McKinley, Mora, San Juan, and Socorro Counties.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Sandy Coachman as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
