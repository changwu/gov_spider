    WASHINGTON â€” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign spokesman Michael Briggs issued the following statement Thursday after a CNN/ORC poll showed Sen. Sanders with an eight point lead in Iowa. The poll was released after an aide to Sec. Hillary Clinton said she gave a speech to "shake some sense" into Iowans:
"At a time when Sec. Clinton's lead is evaporating in Iowa we understand why her campaign is panicking and saying absurd things. The people of Iowa showed extraordinary courage in 2008 by voting for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton, and many Iowans now understand that it's too late for her brand of establishment politics and establishment economics."
