    President Bush signed a Determination that opens the way for Serbia and Montenegro to receive defense articles, services, and assistance from the United States. The President determined that defense cooperation with Serbia and Montenegro will encourage continued defense reform and strengthen Serbia and Montenegro's democratic institutions, furthering the U.S. goal of achieving peace and security in Southeastern Europe.
The President's decision follows significant steps by Serbia and Montenegro to advance defense reform, improve cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and combat organized crime in the wake of the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Djindjic. The United States looks forward to increasing cooperation with Serbia and Montenegro, building on the Secretary of State's visit to Belgrade earlier this month. We encourage the government of Serbia and Montenegro to continue to pursue the reforms that will advance Serbia and Montenegro's integration with the Euro-Atlantic community.
