Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that 11 more Georgia State Legislators joined the Romney for President Team. They join Georgia Senate President Pro Tempore Eric Johnson who announced his support for Governor Romney earlier this week.
"We are glad to have these lawmakers join the Romney team. Each one of them has told me they recognize that Governor Romney has the skills to turn this economy around. We need a CEO with real-life business experience as President," said Romney for President Georgia State Co-Chairman Speaker Pro Tempore Mark Burkhalter. "As state legislators, they see every day that Washington is broken and that only Governor Romney can turn this ship around. Each of us here on the Romney team look forward to supporting our candidate. He is a red-blooded conservative, one who will keep 'Red States' red in the General Election and who will win other states on the way to the White House."
In announcing their support, Governor Romney said, "I appreciate the support of these strong Republican leaders from Georgia. Together we can strengthen America by cutting taxes, ending illegal immigration, and building up our military. I look forward to working with these legislators to earn the support of as many Georgians as possible."
