    Des Moines, IA (October 29, 2007) - On Tuesday night, Senator Joe Biden will participate in MSNBC's democratic debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Today, supporters across Iowa announced statewide debate watch parties, where they will gather to discuss Senator Biden's growing momentum in the Hawkeye State.
A total of 11 Iowa state legislators have endorsed Senator Biden to date, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Speaker Pro Tem Polly Bukta, State Senator Joe Seng, and McKinley Bailey, the youngest member of the Iowa State Legislature and a returning Iraq veteran. And recently, Senator Biden became the first Democrat in Iowa—and in the nation—to receive a newspaper endorsement for president. The Storm Lake Times opined, "Biden is our choice for the nomination for the powerful personal story he ! shares, for his deep knowledge of international affairs, and for his long record of exemplary service in the United States Senate."
