    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, I transmit herewith my recommendation that the authority to waive subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 be extended for a period of 12 months.
This recommendation sets forth the reasons for extending waiver authority, and for my determination relating to continuation of the waiver applicable to the Socialist Republic of Romania, as called for by subsections (d)(1)(B) and (d) (1) (c) of section 402 of the Trade Act. I include, as part of this recommendation, my determination that extension of the waiver authority, and continuation of the waiver applicable to the Socialist Republic of Romania, will substantially promote the objectives of section 402.
