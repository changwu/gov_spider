    Governor Mitt Romney
MSNBC's "Morning Joe"
September 14, 2007
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough: "Do you support a national constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage?"
Governor Romney: "Boy, I sure do. You know, that's a topic that's really, I think, very important to the country because marriage is not just about adults. Marriage is about the development and nurturing of kids, and in my view, the development of a child is enhanced by having a mom and dad. And so, I think it's very important that we have a national standard because marriage is a status. You get married in one place and then you move to another, you're still married at least in the eyes of the community and the children and the benefits may not follow you, but ultimately we're going to have one standard of marriage in this country and that standard ought to be one man and one woman."
Scarborough: "Any other major Republican candidates support the marriage amendment?"
Governor Romney: "You know, I don't think that Rudy or Fred or John McCain support the marriage amendment and I think they're in error on that one."
