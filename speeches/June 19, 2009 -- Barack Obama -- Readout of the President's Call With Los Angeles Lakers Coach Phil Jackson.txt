    Yesterday afternoon, President Obama called Phil Jackson, head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, to congratulate him on his team winning the NBA Finals and on his record-setting 10th championship as a head coach. They also discussed the keys to the Lakers’ success and the President’s interest in the Lakers’ innovative triangle offense. The President told Jackson that he has admired the coach since his days with the Chicago Bulls and is excited to meet him and congratulate the team in person at the White House.
