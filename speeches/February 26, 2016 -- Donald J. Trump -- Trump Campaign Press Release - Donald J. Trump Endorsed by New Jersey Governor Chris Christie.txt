(New York, NY) February 26th, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump received the coveted endorsement of highly respected New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at a campaign rally in Fort Worth, TX.

Mr. Trump stated, "It is my great honor to receive the endorsement of the Governor. We have had a wonderful relationship for many years. He is a solid person that I have tremendous respect for. I am really proud to receive the support of the Governor and his family."
Governor Christie, who ended his Presidential bid earlier this month following the New Hampshire primary added, "Donald is a leader. He is a successful person that, like me, isn't afraid to tell it like it is. Our system is broken and it won't be fixed from the inside. I am proud to offer my endorsement of his candidacy for President."
Governor Christie joined Mr. Trump at a campaign event in Texas to officially announce the endorsement and will travel with him to Oklahoma City for a rally later today.
Mr. Trump has also been endorsed by Congressmen Chris Collins, Congressman Duncan Hunter, Jr., former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, South Carolina Lt. Governor Henry McMaster, Arizona Treasurer Jeff DeWitt and many other influential conservative leaders. He will campaign in Oklahoma later today and travel to Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia and beyond over the next few days.
