    President Donald J. Trump's re-election campaign today named Max Miller to the post of Deputy Campaign Manager for Presidential Operations. Miller will be responsible for all campaign events that include the involvement of the President, Vice President Mike Pence, or other notable figures. Miller moves over from the White House, where he had been deputy assistant to the President leading the advance team, and will report to Campaign Manager Brad Parscale and Deputy Campaign Manager Bill Stepien.
"I am proud to welcome Max to the team that is going to re-elect President Trump less than four months from today," Parscale said. "Every day, our campaign grows in strength, and Max's wealth of experience and expertise is an important addition to our team's world-class advance efforts."
