"Gov. List is a respected, committed leader who embodies the very best of Nevada, and I am honored to receive his endorsement," said Walker.

"He is a tested leader who, through hard work and without compromising his principles, brought his vision for a better Wisconsin to life. I look forward to working with Gov.
