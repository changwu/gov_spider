    After Backing Bloomberg, Deutch Becomes 8th Congressional Supporter
Today, Florida Congressman Ted Deutch of Boca Raton released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I am proud to announce my endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States. Joe has the experience, judgment, and decency to defeat Donald Trump and bring America together. Additionally, with Joe at the top of the ticket, I am confident we can keep our majority in the House and have a shot at turning the Senate blue. We deserve a President who will tell the truth, stand up to the NRA to end the epidemic of gun violence, urgently take on climate change and stand proudly with our key allies around the world. It is time to end a presidency that has torn America apart and start an optimistic new chapter behind President Joe Biden."
Deutch joins more than 45 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, and current Members of Congress Lois Frankel (D-21), Kathy Castor (D-14), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23), Al Lawson (FL-5), Frederica Wilson (FL-24), Alcee Hastings (FL-20), and Charlie Crist (FL-13). Biden also has the most support from more Members of Congress of any candidate in the race with 58 members backing him. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
