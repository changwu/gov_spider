    LAST September I announced a program of earned return for those who were draft evaders and military absentees during the Vietnam conflict.
This program was intended to reach a broad group of young Americans who had been convicted, charged, investigated, or who were still sought for violations of the Military Selective Service Act or of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Also, this program was intended to provide a way for many persons who received an undesirable discharge from military service for absentee related offenses to upgrade their discharge certificate to a clemency discharge.
After reviewing the progress of this program, I believe that many of those who could benefit from it are only now learning of its application to their cases. This belief is based on a significant increase in the number of applications and inquiries over the past few weeks when publicity and communications about the program were greatly expanded.
Therefore, I am today extending the termination date for applications from January 31 until March 1, 1975.
