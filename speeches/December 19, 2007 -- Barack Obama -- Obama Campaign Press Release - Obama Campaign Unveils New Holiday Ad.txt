    Des Moines, IA--This Friday, the Obama campaign will begin airing a new Holiday television ad in Iowa
to mark the holiday season. The ad features Barack and Michelle Obama and their daughters Sasha, age
6, and Malia, age 9, gathered by a Christmas tree thanking Iowa families for the hospitality and
stories they have shared with the Obamas during this campaign and wishing Iowa families a merry
Christmas and happy holidays.
Senator Obama is scheduled to campaign in Iowa on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before taking time
off the campaign trail to be with his family in Iowa over Christmas. He will resume campaigning on
the morning of December 26 and will continue until the night of the caucuses on January 3.
You can view the new television ad HERE.
The full text of the Holiday Ad appears below:
Michelle Obama: We would like to take a moment to thank you and your family for the warmth and
friendship that you have shown ours; for sharing your hospitality and your stories.
Barack Obama: In this holiday season we are reminded that the things that unite us as a people are
more powerful and enduring than anything that sets us apart. And we all have a stake in each other,
in something larger than ourselves.
So from my family to yours, I am Barack Obama and I approve this message.
Malia Obama: Merry Christmas
Sasha Obama: Happy Holidays
