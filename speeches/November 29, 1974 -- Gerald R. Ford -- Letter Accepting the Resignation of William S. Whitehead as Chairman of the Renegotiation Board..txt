    Dear Bill:
I have your letter of November 29, and I will, of course, accept your resignation as Chairman of the Renegotiation Board, effective December 1, 1974.
The last five years have been difficult and challenging ones for you, and I want you to know that I fully understand the considerations which prompted your decision to resign the Chairmanship prior to your resignation as a member. The Renegotiation Board has a most important and vital role in government, and it is my intention to reinvigorate the Board so as to expand its role in the fight against inflation.
You have my sincere thanks and deep appreciation for your years of service to our Nation. Please know that you take with you my very best wishes for every happiness and success in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable William Scholl Whitehead, Chairman, Renegotiation Board, Washington, D.C. 20446]
