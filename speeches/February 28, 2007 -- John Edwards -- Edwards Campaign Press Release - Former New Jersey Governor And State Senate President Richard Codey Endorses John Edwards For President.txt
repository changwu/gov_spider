CODEY TO BACK JOHN EDWARDS FOR PRESIDENT
New Jersey President Richard J. Codey today announced that he is endorsing John Edwards for President of the United States.
"John Edwards has the leadership qualities and the experience to lead this nation," said Senator Codey. "John Edwards also has the best vision to put a Democrat back in the White House."
Senator Codey said he decided to endorse Edwards now to help him build critical momentum in New Jersey in the months ahead.
"This nation deserves a President who will unite us behind a vision of economic growth and a sensible foreign policy that will help us deal realistically with the War against Terrorism," Senator Codey said. "That person is John Edwards."
Senator Codey said he was attracted to Edwards for his commitment to help the United States develop energy independence, a vigorous enforcement of trade agreements to help expand our manufacturing base and an honest plan to provide health care for all Americans.
"Our country has been divided by the inept leadership of President Bush who has continued to mislead us over the war in Iraq," Senator Codey said. "New Jersey is ready to support a candidate with the integrity, the intelligence and the courage of John Edwards."
