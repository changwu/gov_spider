    I am pleased today to sign H.R. 145, the Computer Security Act of 1987. This Act will provide the foundation for a comprehensive and consistent approach to computer security throughout the Federal Government. I sign this Act with the understanding that it will neither expand nor restrict the Federal Government's present or future disclosure obligations under the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, as amended, with respect to information pertaining to Federal computer systems or information stored in those systems. The Act will enhance the ability of the Federal Government to manage and protect its computer resources and represents a significant step forward in the effective use of these new technologies.
