    I am pleased that the Senate passed the "Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act," which would continue to build on the great progress we have made in helping children with disabilities achieve their full potential. By working together to open doors for citizens with disabilities, we can help fulfill the promise of our great Nation.
This legislation will further promote educational opportunities for children with disabilities. I am committed to working together with students, parents, teachers, schools, and communities to ensure that all children are given every chance to learn and to reach their full potential, including children with disabilities.
I urge the House and Senate to meet in a timely manner in order to reach agreement on a final legislative package that I can sign into law this year.
