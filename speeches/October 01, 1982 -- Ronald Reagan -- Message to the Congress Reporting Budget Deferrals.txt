    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report twenty deferrals of fiscal year 1983 funds totaling $598,780,000. The deferrals are primarily routine in nature and do not, in most cases, affect program levels.
The deferrals are for programs in International Development Assistance, the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, State, Transportation, Treasury, the District of Columbia, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation and the Railroad Retirement Board.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
