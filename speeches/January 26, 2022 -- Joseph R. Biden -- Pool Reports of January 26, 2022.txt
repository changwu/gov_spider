White House In-Town Pool Report #2 — gathering for POTUS 
The pool is gathering for President Biden's event in the State Dining Room with private sector executives and — we hope — comments from the president on Justice Stephen Breyer's retirement.

White House In-Town Pool Report #3 — POTUS on Breyer 
President Biden told reporters that he would have "more to say later" about Justice Breyer's retirement, but said that he was waiting for the justice's own statement.
"There has been no announcement from Justice Breyer — let him make whatever statement he wants to make, and I'm happy to talk about it later."

White House In-Town Pool Report #4 — POTUS with CEOs 
President Biden went around the table with questions for the assembled CEOs about helping workers return to in-person work, investing in digital technology for exporting American goods, and how "Build Back Better" would address those issues. President Biden expressed his fondness for the new electric F150 to Ford CEO Mary Barra.
"I'm looking for a job, Mary," he said upon hearing the model's ability to accelerate from zero to sixty in 4.4 seconds.
Pool was escorted out at 1:34 p.m., after a false start before President Biden's remarks about Justice Breyer.
