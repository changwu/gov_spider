    I don't know whether I have changed any in weight since I have reached the Black Hills. I am heavy enough. I don't desire to get any heavier and, perhaps, running through the fields may reduce my weight a little. If it did, I shouldn't regret it at all. I find the general effect of this climate and surroundings to be good.

I thought the Naval Conference at Geneva started off very well and of the proposals that were made by the three governments each of them indicated very clearly that they were very sincere in their desire for further naval limitations. I don't care to discuss the details of them while the conference is going on, because it often happens that in the somewhat informal methods of discussion here in the conference when the reports are carried abroad they are given quite a different impression from what I had intended to give to the conference. So while the conference is in session I shall not undertake to discuss in detail the questions that it has before it.

I don't know whether Ambassador Herrick will come out here while he is in this country. I think it is somewhat doubtful, though he may. I haven't any plan about that at the present time. I do not think he is coming here with any plans for a new treaty between this country and France relative to the suggestion of outlawing war. I never heard of any such thing and I think it is entirely improbable that such is the case. There have been no developments about that. I think you had a report from the Office of the Secretary of State relative to the nature of the response that he made to France that our country would be glad to know what plans they had and that they could be developed when Ambassador Herrick returns to France and when the French Ambassador returns to America.
