    I am pleased that the Senate last night passed the "Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act," important bipartisan legislation to help our Nation prepare its computer systems for the new millennium.
This bill, which builds upon a proposal my administration submitted to Congress in July, will help businesses, State and local government, and Federal agencies better address the year 2000 (Y2K) problem by providing limited liability protections to encourage greater information sharing about solutions, while also protecting consumers from misleading advertising or other statements when purchasing products for their own use.
January 1, 2000, is one deadline we cannot push back. I urge the House to pass this critical legislation before the end of the legislative session. I look forward to signing it into law so that Y2K information sharing will enable the Nation to prepare for this global challenge.
