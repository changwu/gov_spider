White House In-Town Pool Report #1 
Good morning all. It's a grey, damp morning at the White House, where your pooler is attempting to dry off after coronavirus testing at Jackson Place.
Per the press office, this afternoon's press briefing (scheduled for 12.30 p.m.) will begin with a guest, and President Biden is later scheduled to give remarks about national vaccination efforts at 3.15 p.m. For those who cannot be here due to social distancing requirements, please feel free to send any questions you'd like asked in today's briefing my way — they will be sorted by charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent.
