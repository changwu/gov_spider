    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Chile (the "Treaty"), signed at Washington on June 5, 2013. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty would replace the outdated extradition treaty between the United States and Chile, signed at Santiago on April 17, 1900 (the "1900 Treaty"). The Treaty follows generally the form and content of other extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It would replace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern "dual criminality" approach, which would enable extradition for such offenses as money laundering and other newer offenses not appearing on the list from the 1900 Treaty. The Treaty also contains a modernized "political offense" clause and provides that extradition shall not be refused based on the nationality of the person sought. Finally, the Treaty incorporates a series of procedural improvements to streamline and speed the extradition process.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to its ratification.
