    "It's been two years since President Obama's so-called 'recovery summer' — but struggling middle-class Americans are still waiting for their recovery. Jobless claims are up, unemployment is at a five-month high, and Americans are suffering from the worst economic recovery the country has ever had. Mitt Romney has a plan that will strengthen our middle class and finally get Americans back to work." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
This Morning, Obama Senior Adviser David Axelrod Tried To Re-Write History On President Obama's Failed "Recovery Summer":
David Axelrod, On Whether He Had Claimed 2010 Would Be A "Recovery Summer": "Well, You Should Show Me The Tape Of Me Saying That." WALLACE: "But David, didn't this White House badly misjudge this recovery? I remember in 2010, two summers ago, you and Vice President Biden were running around talking about recovery summer. That was the summer of 2010. And the fact is that your White House said that if you got the stimulus—the $800 billion dollars—that unemployment would stay under 8 percent. In fact, with the stimulus, unemployment has stayed over 8 percent for the last 42 months. That's three and a half years." AXELROD: "Chris, first of all. I wasn't around saying anything other than that we were going to have to be persistent—that it took years to get in this mess, it was going to take years to get out." WALLACE: "You talked about 'Recovery Summer' in 2010, sir." AXELROD: "Well, you should show me the tape of me saying that." (FOX's "Fox News Sunday," 8/5/12)
But David Axelrod Repeatedly Touted President Obama's So-Called "Recovery Summer" In June 2010:
In June 2010, David Axelrod Previewed The "Recovery Summer" By Saying "This Summer Will Be The Most Active Recovery Act Season Yet." "David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president, said: 'This summer will be the most active Recovery Act season yet, with thousands of highly-visible road, bridge, water and other infrastructure projects breaking ground across the country, giving the American people a first-hand look at the Recovery Act in their own backyards and making it crystal clear what the cost would have been of doing nothing.'" (Mike Allen, "Obama, Biden Declare 'Recovery Summer'," Politico, 6/17/10)


    Axelrod: "Just Over A Year Later, The Recovery Act Is Putting Millions Of Americans To Work And Helping The Economy Grow Again." "Axelrod continued: 'In the face of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, Republicans in Congress chose to play politics with economic recovery and declared the Recovery Act a failure before it even began. They made a cynical bet that if the President fails, they win. Democrats chose to act by tackling the crisis head-on. Just over a year later, the Recovery Act is putting millions of Americans to work and helping the economy grow again. But our work is far from over:'" (Mike Allen, "Obama, Biden Declare 'Recovery Summer'," Politico, 6/17/10)
  

Axelrod: "We Also Have More -- Many Of The Recovery Act Projects Around The Country Are Taking Hold This Summer, By Design." AXELROD: "The president has recommended the steps that he thinks Congress should take now. We also have more -- many of the Recovery Act projects around the country are taking hold this summer, by design. That will involve a lot of private industry construction, and so on." (NBC's "Meet The Press," 6/13/10)
