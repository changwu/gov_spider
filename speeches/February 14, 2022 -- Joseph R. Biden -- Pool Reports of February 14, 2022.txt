In town pool report #1 - checking in 
Greetings from a crisp Valentine's Day morning at the White House. It's 26 degrees, with patches of blue sky between clouds and a few snow flurries. President Biden started the morning at Camp David. He is scheduled to return to the White House aboard Marine One at 10:30 am. That arrival could be delayed slightly.
Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is scheduled to give a press briefing at 2:30 pm.
There are no other public events on the President's schedule.
Around 10 am, President Biden's official twitter account posted a message marking the fourth anniversary of the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The tweet read: "On February 14th, 2018, a gunman stole the lives of 14 students and 3 educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Today we mourn with the Parkland families whose lives were upended and stand with those working to end the epidemic of gun violence. Congress must act."
Your pooler was tested by the White House for COVID-19 before walking onto the White House grounds.
On the North Lawn, the White House has placed Valentine's Day decorations facing the television cameras at Pebble Beach. There's a large red heart painted with a verse from 1 Corinthians 13:13: "Three things will last forever—faith, hope & love– and the greatest of these is love". There are also wooden cutouts painted to look like the White House pets, Willow the cat and Commander the dog, each with hearts on their collars.

In town pool report #2 - arrival 
Marine One touched down at 10:48 am on the South Lawn. President Biden walked out of the helicopter with First Lady Jill Biden. They held hands as they walked across the grass. Reporters shouted questions. He did not stop to talk. He was asked if he had a message for immigrants protesting outside. He was asked if the Russian invasion in Ukraine is closer than ever. Biden lowered his mask and said "Happy Valentine's Day." The two walked into the South Portico entrance.
