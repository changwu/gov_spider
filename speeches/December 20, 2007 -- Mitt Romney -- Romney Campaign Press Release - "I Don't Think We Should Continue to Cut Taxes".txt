    Sen. McCain Voted Against The Bush Tax Cuts; Candidate McCain Supports Them
"Anybody who watched my campaign should not have been astounded that I voted against the [Bush] tax cut ..." – Sen. John McCain, 2001 (Kirk Victor, "McCain's Evolution," National Journal, 8/8/01)
"I will not let the Democrats roll back the Bush tax cuts." – Sen. John McCain, 2007 (Liz Sidoti, "McCain: Retool Jobs Programs," The Associated Press, 10/10/07)
On The Campaign Trail, Sen. McCain Now Pledges To Make The Bush Tax Cuts Permanent:
Sen. McCain's Economic Plan Calls For Making The Bush Tax Cuts Permanent. "John McCain will make the Bush income and investment tax cuts permanent, keeping income tax rates at their current level and fighting the Democrats' plans for a crippling tax increase in 2011. Left to their devices, Democrats will impose a massive $100 billion tax hike, almost $700 per taxpayer every year." (Sen. John McCain, "John McCain Unveils Economic Plan: Bold Solutions For American Prosperity," Press Release, 12/18/07)
But In The Senate, McCain Voted Against The Bush Tax Cuts, Saying They Benefited The Wealthy:
In 2001, Sen. McCain Was One Of Only Two Republicans To Vote Against The $1.35 Trillion Bush Tax Cuts. The bill lowered marginal rates, eliminated the marriage penalty, and doubled the child tax credit. (H.R. 1836, CQ Vote #170: Adopted 58-33: R 46-2; D 12-31; I 0-0, 5/26/01, McCain Voted Nay)
- Sen. McCain Said The 2001 Bush Tax Cuts Benefited The Wealthy. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "I think there is a belief in America that too much of this tax cut still goes to wealthiest Americans. And maybe we could do something about those that still pay a significant portion of their income in payroll taxes." (CNN's "Late Edition," 3/11/01)

In 2003, Sen. McCain Was One Of Only Three Republicans To Twice Vote Against The $350 Billion Bush Tax Cuts. The comprehensive bill lowered taxes by $350 billion over 11 years - including increasing the child tax credit and elminating the marriage penality. (H.R. 2, CQ Vote #179: Passed 51-49: R 48-3; D 3-45; I 0-1, 5/15/03, McCain Voted Nay; H.R. 2, CQ Vote #196: Adopted 50-50: R 48-3; D 2-46; I 0-1, 5/23/03, McCain Voted Nay)
- Sen. McCain Said The 2003 Bush Tax Cuts Benefited The Wealthy. MCCAIN: "I want to see tax cuts, if they are necessary, go to working Americans, not the wealthiest." (Richard Ruelas, "McCain Isn't Saying 'Oui' To Bush's Tax Cut Plan," The Arizona Republic, 4/25/03)

And In 2004, Sen. McCain Said He Was Against Making All Of The Bush Tax Cuts Permanent:
Sen. John McCain: "They Want To Make The Tax Cuts For Higher-Income People Permanent, And I Don't Want That." (NPR's "Morning Edition," 6/16/04)
Sen. McCain Said He Would "Clearly" Not Support Extending The Tax Cuts. NBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Since the Civil War, every president who has been at war has increased taxes. Should the president consider postponing his tax cut?" SEN. MCCAIN: "I would have – I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate amount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit. But the middle-income tax credits, the families, the child tax credits, the marriage tax credits, all of those I would keep." (NBC's "Meet The Press," 4/11/04)
Sen. McCain: "I Don't Think We Should Continue To Cut Taxes." MCCAIN: "I don't think we should continue to cut taxes. I like – I think every American – I'm in favor of the middle-class, middle- income tax cuts, and I would vote to make them permanent." (Sen. John McCain, Remarks, Washington, D.C., 5/18/04)
