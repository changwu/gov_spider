    "This record economic growth is absolute validation of President Trump's policies which create jobs and opportunities for Americans in every corner of the country. The President built the world's best economy once and he's rapidly doing it again, proving that cutting taxes and reducing regulations and red tape clear the way for American ingenuity and our entrepreneurial spirit to thrive. We have regained more than half of the jobs lost to the global pandemic in less than six months, while it took more than two years to regain half of job losses from a recession while Joe Biden was in charge. President Trump will continue to safely reopen the country, while Biden is the candidate of lockdowns, inviting another economic shutdown which would devastate working people and cause even more health problems above and beyond what the coronavirus has caused. Biden has been an economic disaster for nearly five decades in Washington, backing disastrous trade deals and putting China's interests ahead of American workers. Biden's plans for a $4 trillion tax increase and Green New Deal regulations on every person, business, building, and farm in the nation would kill this recovery while it's already in full swing. For voters, the choice is simple: It's a Trump boom versus a Biden depression."
