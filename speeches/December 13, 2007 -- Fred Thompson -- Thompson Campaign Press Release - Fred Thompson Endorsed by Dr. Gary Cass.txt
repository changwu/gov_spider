McLean, VA - The Fred Thompson campaign today announced the endorsement of Dr. Gary Cass.
"It is my distinct pleasure to give my personal endorsement to Senator Fred Thompson for President of the United States," said Dr. Cass. "Fred Thompson's natural style and consistently conservative voting record will distinguish him from the others. This powerful combination has gained him the support of the largest pro-life organization in America, the National Right to Life Committee PAC. In an increasingly dangerous world, our nation needs a proven, conservative leader who will stand strong for America and our way of life. Fred Thompson is that leader."
Dr. Gary Cass is the former Executive Director of the late Dr. D. James Kennedy's Center for Reclaiming America. As an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church of America, Dr. Cass is currently Chairman and CEO of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission. Dr. Cass has been an entrenched pro-life activist for many years. In 2002, Gary received the California Life Coalition's Pro-Life Service Award for demonstrated excellence in his commitment to protecting life.
"I am blessed and deeply grateful for the endorsement of Dr. Cass, who is held in high regard by conservative Evangelical Christians across the country," said Senator Thompson. "I appreciate the confidence that Dr. Cass has placed in me and the ideas I have for our country. As the campaign heats up, his prayers for me and my family offer us great comfort and strength."
