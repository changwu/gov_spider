In-town pool report #13 speech ends
Biden's speech from the South Court Auditorium concluded at 2:19
A few highlights:
(speaking about the three most recent objects shot down) "We don't know yet know exactly what these three objects were, and nothing right now suggests they're related" to the Chinese balloon
"I want to be clear: we don't have any evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky."
Biden said he would direct his team to come back with "sharper rules" for how to deal with objects and determine if they constitute a security risk or not.
On the Chinese balloon:
Said he made a decision to wait on shooting down the balloon in consultation with the military, until it was over the water.
But he said shooting it down "sent sent a clear message, a clear message, that the violation of our sovereignty is unacceptable."

Jean-Pierre said during today's briefing that cast members, members of Till's family, historians, and families of the victims of hate crimes will be in attendance.
"This is something that the president and first lady are very much looking forward to. Remember this is Black History Month, and we think it's important to screen this movie, an incredibly powerful movie."

Supplemental pool report #1: Arrival
Good morning! I'm your supplemental pool reporter for the president's physical.
POTUS landed at Walter Reed via Marine One at 9:09 a.m., exited at 9:13 and entered the beast without taking questions. The motorcade traveled a very short distance and we caught a glimpse of POTUS entering the hospital at 9:16.
Will let you know when we hear more.



February 16, 202312:14

Supplemental pool report #2: Departure
Pool held in a room inside the hospital and received no updates during hold time.
After leaving the hold, we set up in a light drizzle outside to see POTUS exit the hospital at 12:06 p.m. He then took a perhaps 100-yard ride in the beast before boarding Marine One at 12:09. The president did not take questions and took off for the White House at 12:14.
POTUS appeared in good health and spirits during departure. The physical is expected to be released this afternoon.
Handing back off to the in-town pool. Thank you!
