    Don't you know it's raining?
Well, let me say first of all that I'm very grateful and surprised to see you all out here in the rain. It means a lot to me to know that as we have been partners for the last 4 years that we still have the same relationship. We've made a good record for ourselves; we've tackled every tough issue that the Nation has faced without flinching; we made the right decisions. I think we have served our Nation well. We can be proud of what we have achieved.
The election this day is one that's part of a democratic process that'll give the American people a chance to express their opinion about what the future ought to hold. I feel confident about the outcome. I want to make sure that all of you don't forget to vote. This is your privilege and also your duty.
It may be a long night. We don't know yet what the returns will be. But I understand there's a heavy turnout so far in the areas that have been reported in. We have a long way to go. This is a very important day for me and for you both, I think for our country.
So, let me close by saying from the bottom of my heart no matter what the outcome is today I still feel very confident. You've got my eternal gratitude and my eternal friendshipâ€”and not only mine but the Nation's, because you've done a superb job. And I look forward to doing the same superb job with you the next 4 years.
God bless you. Thank you very much.
