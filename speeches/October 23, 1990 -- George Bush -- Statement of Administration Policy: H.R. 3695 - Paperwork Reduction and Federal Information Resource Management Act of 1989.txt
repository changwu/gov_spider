    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conyers (D) MI and Horton (R) NY)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3695 and urges that it not be considered under suspension of the rules.
The Administration urges, instead, that the House await Senate passage of S. 1742, which has been the vehicle for negotiations between the Administration and the House and Senate oversight committees.
