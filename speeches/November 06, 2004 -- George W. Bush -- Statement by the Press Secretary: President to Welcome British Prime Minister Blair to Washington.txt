    President Bush will welcome British Prime Minister Tony Blair to the White House for discussions on November 11-12, 2004. As the President said in his press conference on November 4, 2004, he is determined to continue to reach out to friends and allies, and the EU and NATO, to promote development and progress, to defeat the terrorists and to encourage freedom and democracy as alternatives to tyranny and terror.
The United Kingdom stands as one of America's closest allies, and Tony Blair as one of America's greatest friends. The President looks forward to discussing with Prime Minister Blair how to strengthen further U.S. cooperation with the United Kingdom and all of Europe, as we address together the many challenges our nations face at the beginning of the 21st century.
