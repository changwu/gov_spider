    Former Oklahoma Senator Don Nickles made the following statement on Oklahoma's upcoming primary:
"Conservatives propelled Mitt Romney to victory in Arizona and Michigan and they are supporting him in Oklahoma because he is the only candidate with private sector experience and a bold plan to get our economy back on track. Throughout the campaign, Mitt Romney has displayed the same steady and reliable leadership he has shown throughout his life in business, the Olympics, and as governor — Oklahomans have been waiting for this steady leadership in the White House. I urge all Oklahomans who want to stop mortgaging our future to China, get Washington out of our lives, and ensure that our future is brighter than our past to vote for Mitt Romney on Tuesday — our country can't afford four more years of President Obama."
