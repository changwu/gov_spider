    MILWAUKEE — Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Thursday released a powerful video featuring civil rights activist Erica Garner, the eldest daughter of Eric Garner who died in 2014 during his arrest by New York City police.
In the video, Erica discusses the impact of her father's death on her family. "I'm just trying to get the truth out there to tell his side of the story," Garner says. "He was being the loving, caring man that he was and he was murdered."
Eric Garner died on July 17, 2014, after a police officer put him in a chokehold outside of a convenience store on Staten Island.
"I feel like a representative for people throughout this whole nation because I'm doing this — I'm speaking out," Erica says of her work after her father's death. "I'm never giving up. I'm never going to forget and I don't want the world to forget what happened to my dad."
"I'm behind anyone who's going to listen and speak up for us, and I think we need to believe in a leader like Bernie Sanders," Garner says. "That's why I'm for Bernie."
