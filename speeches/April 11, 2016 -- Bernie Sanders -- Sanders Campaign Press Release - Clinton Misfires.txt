    BUFFALO, N.Y. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign spokesman Michael Briggs issued the following statement after Hillary Clinton blamed Vermont for guns in New York:
"I don't know why Secretary Clinton would be so critical of the governor of Vermont who strongly supports her candidacy. What Gov. Shumlin recently said is true: 'It is campaign season, therefore, things are sometimes said by all the candidates that sometimes aren't entirely accurate. I would just say this, I think you'd have a hard time convincing Vermonters that New York's crime problems are coming from Vermont.'"
