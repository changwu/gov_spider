    The President welcomed the opportunity to visit with members of the Congressional Black Caucus today at the White House. They had a positive discussion about their shared concern for the Haitian people. The President continues to deplore the violence in Haiti, and is greatly concerned about the loss of life.
The President indicated he would consider their ideas as we work toward a peaceful political solution to the current situation. The United States is actively working with the international community to help the Haitian people find such a political solution. Humanitarian assistance for the Haitian people is a priority, and we continue to work through our relief organizations to make sure that aid is getting to those who need it.
