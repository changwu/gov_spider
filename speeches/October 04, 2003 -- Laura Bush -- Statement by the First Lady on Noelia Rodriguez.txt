    Noelia Rodriguez has been a loyal and trusted advisor to me for nearly three years. From my early days at the White House, to the tragic aftermath of the terrorist attacks, to my recent trip to Paris and Moscow, Noelia has been a dedicated advisor. I value her honest opinions, wit and keen sense of judgment. Her ability to work with the White House press corps and members of the media throughout our Nation has served me and President Bush's Administration well. While I am sad to see her leave, I look forward to calling on her whenever I need candid advice.
