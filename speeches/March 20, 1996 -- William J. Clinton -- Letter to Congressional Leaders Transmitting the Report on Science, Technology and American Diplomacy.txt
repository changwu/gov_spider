    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
I am pleased to transmit this annual report on Science, Technology and American Diplomacy for fiscal year 1995, in accordance with Title V of the Foreign Relations Act of Fiscal Year 1979, as amended (Public Law 95-426; 22 U.S.C. 2656c(b)).
Science and technology (S&T) are central to the goals of economic security, military strength, and diplomatic engagementâ€”the vital elements of national security. The wisdom of our investments in S&T will significantly affect our ability to meet our national security challenges as we move into the next century. International cooperation in S&T serves to prevent and mitigate threats to society, increase exports of U.S. technologies, and promote sustainable development.
The Title V report provides the context for international science and technology cooperation in the implementation of our foreign policy. This year's streamlined report presents an overview of current U.S. S&T policy, S&T cooperation in the post-Cold War era, and its relation to foreign policy goals, such as building democracy, promoting and maintaining peace, and furthering economic growth and sustainable development. Following the thematic chapters are narratives on science and technology cooperation with key countries.
We face the challenge of seeking greater world stability at a critical time in our history. Finding effective solutions to global problems that impact Americans can be accomplished, in part, through interactions with scientists around the globe. We must continue to ensure that our country maintains world leadership in science and technology, and that international cooperation continues to advance our broad policy interests.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
