    THE DEATH of General David Sarnoff is a great loss not only for America but for the world. A monumental figure in electronic communications, history will record him as a man of pioneering vision and indomitable action. General Sarnoff had those qualities of spirit that embody the highest tradition of our Nation--imagination, daring, patriotism, and generosity. Mrs. Nixon and I join his family and the Nation at large in mourning the passing of this gifted American.
