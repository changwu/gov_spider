    Orangeburg Organizing for Hillary
Another Orangeburg leader added her name today to the growing list of area leaders supporting Senator Hillary Clinton as the next President. School Board Trustee Member Alice Pinckney formally announced her endorsement of Hillary as the best choice for the White House.
"Hillary's the right choice. She's got the experience to hit the ground running and we need that for our country, for South Carolina and for Orangeburg," Pinckney said. "I have a heart for education and she's the best choice for our schools and our children."
Pinckney joins a growing campaign for Hillary in the Orangeburg area. Orangeburg Sheriff Larry Williams, Auditor Roger Cleckley and Branchville Mayor Tim Cooner have all endorsed Hillary and actively joined the campaign. State Senator John Matthews of Orangeburg serves as one of Hillary's four state co-chairs for the South Carolina campaign.
Last month, former Democratic National Committee Chairman and Hillary Campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe cut the ribbon at Hillary's Orangeburg campaign office, located at 747 John C. Calhoun Drive,?suite D. At the Hillary Home-Team tailgate party at the SC State Homecoming game in Orangeburg, more than 1,500 Hillary supporters, including nearly 500 new supporters, signed up for the campaign.
