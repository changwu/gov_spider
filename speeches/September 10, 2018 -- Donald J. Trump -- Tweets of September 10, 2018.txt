If the Democrats had won the Election in 2016 GDP which was about 1% and going down would have been minus 4% instead of up 4.2%. I opened up our beautiful economic engine with Regulation and Tax Cuts. Our system was choking and would have been made worse. Still plenty to do!Retweets: 15995Favorites: 65807

The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are fiction. Dems can't stand losing. I'll write the real book!Retweets: 17211Favorites: 76167

'I'm taking this book with a grain of salt & everyone should do the same. Multiple sources but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by Woodward. You cannot take this book too seriously.' Katelyn Caralle Washington ExaminerRetweets: 12282Favorites: 53974

'It is mostly anonymous sources in here why should anyone trust you? General Mattis General Kelly said it's not true.' @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the Midterms. He was caught cold even by NBC.Retweets: 14920Favorites: 57772

The Economy is soooo good perhaps the best in our country's history (remember it's the economy stupid!) that the Democrats are flailing & lying like CRAZY! Phony books articles and T.V.
