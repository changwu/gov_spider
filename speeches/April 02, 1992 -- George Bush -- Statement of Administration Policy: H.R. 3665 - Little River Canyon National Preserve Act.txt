    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/3/92)(House)(Bevill (D) AL)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3665 as reported by the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. Although the Committee report addressed many Administration concerns, the Administration will seek amendments in the Senate, including deletion of Federal authority to acquire land in the existing DeSoto State Park. Management of this established State park should remain a State responsibility.
