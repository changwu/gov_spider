    To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 10448, entitled "An act granting a pension to Squire Walter."
The son of the beneficiary named in this bill enlisted in a West Virginia regiment on the 28th day of June, 1861.
On the 15th day of September, 1862, while bathing in the Potomac River near the Chain Bridge, with the knowledge and consent of his commanding officer, he was drowned.
It is perfectly clear that he lost his life while in the enjoyment of a privilege and when at his request military discipline was relaxed and its restraints removed for his comfort and pleasure. His death resulted from his voluntary and perfectly proper personal indulgence, and can not be in the least attributed to military service.
The father does not appear to be so needy and dependent as is often exhibited in cases of this class.
