    It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I accept the resignation today of John Dalton as Secretary of the Navy. Whether as a young midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, in his business career, or in the 5 years he led the Navy, John has always been a shining example of the best America has to offer.
During Secretary Dalton's tenure, the Navy and Marine Corps have truly risen to the challenge of change, while reaffirming the core values that have always defined the Department of the Navy. His business acumen has helped to streamline and strengthen operations, and he has worked ceaselessly to extend opportunity to every sailor and Marine, helping draw strength from our rich diversity.
I thank him for his service, and for his friendship.
