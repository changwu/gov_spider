    I condemn in the strongest possible terms this horrendous act of terrorist violence. Once again, the enemies of peace have struck down innocent people in an evil effort to destroy the hopes of peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Arabs.
I call on all those who have chosen the path of peace to condemn this act and redouble their efforts to achieve a secure and lasting peace. The perpetrators of terrorism and their sponsors are determined to stop us from achieving this goal. I repeat what I said to them in the Middle East last October: "You cannot succeed. You will not succeed. You must not succeed, for you are the past, not the future."
On behalf of the American people, I extend our condolences and deepest sympathy to the families of the victims.
