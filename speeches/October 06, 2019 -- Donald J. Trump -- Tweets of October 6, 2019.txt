'President Trump would be negligent if he did not bring this matter Biden up. If the V.P. of the U.S. is self enriching & engaged in criminal behavior at a minimum corrupt behavior it ought to be looked at.' Peter Schweizer author 'Secret Empires.' @marklevinshowRetweets: 21357Favorites: 81007

The first so-called second hand information 'Whistleblower' got my phone conversation almost completely wrong so now word is they are going to the bench and another 'Whistleblower' is coming in from the Deep State also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!Retweets: 26530Favorites: 102550

It is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son Hunter who was handed $100000 a month (PlusPlus) from a Ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy...Retweets: 24157Favorites: 91182

....and separately got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason. There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions?

The Biden family was PAID OFF pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.....Retweets: 29066Favorites: 104929

....And by the way I would LOVE running against 1% Joe Biden - I just don't think it's going to happen. Sleepy Joe won't get to the starting gate & based on all of the money he & his family probably 'extorted' Joe should hang it up. I wouldn't want him dealing with China & U!Retweets: 17821Favorites: 73750
