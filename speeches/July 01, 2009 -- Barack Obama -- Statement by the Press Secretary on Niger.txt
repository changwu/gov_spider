    The United States is concerned about the recent actions of Niger’s President Mamadou Tandja to rule by ordinance and decree and to dissolve the National Assembly and the Constitutional Court as part of a bid to retain power beyond his constitutionally-limited mandate. These decisions undermine Niger’s efforts over the last ten years to advance good governance and the rule of law. We are encouraged that the African Union has sent a delegation to Niger to attempt to find resolution to this political crisis. We will continue to consult with our partners in the region and monitor the situation in Niger closely.
