Today, the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments for a set of cases that could pave the way for same-sex marriage across the country.
My partner Nate and I don't need to wait for the decision. We got engaged at the historic Stonewall Inn in New York—and like we shared in Hillary's campaign launch video, we're getting married in Chicago this summer.
But not everyone has that same freedom. In too many states, it's still against the law for two men or two women to make a commitment to love and care for each other. Dads can't adopt children. Moms can't visit one another in the hospital.
Our country has made so much progress in just the last ten years that marriage equality can often feel inevitable. But that is, unfortunately, wishful thinking. It can all be turned back with just one election.
There are some on the other side, including some who are running for president, who find my relationship intolerable. They see me and those like me as second-class citizens, unworthy of our right to pursue happiness.
As we saw just last month in Indiana—and as we continue to see around the world—people who are committed to discrimination can still find ways to act on it.
That's why I'm writing this, and why I was proud to help launch Hillary's campaign. She's been an advocate for equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans. She understands that my family is like her family and yours. We all deserve equal rights.
The arguments in front of the Supreme Court today are the beginning of what we hope is the final step before nationwide marriage equality.
But no matter what happens in the courts, I'm hopeful that come 2016, we'll elect a president who fights for all of us.
Thanks for taking the time to read this.
