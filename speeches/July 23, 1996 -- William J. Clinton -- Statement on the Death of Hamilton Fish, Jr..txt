    Hillary and I wish to express our sympathy over the death of former U.S. Representative Hamilton Fish, Jr.
In the tradition of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Ham chose a life of public service in the Congress, where he tirelessly championed social causes and civil rights even when it was not the popular thing to do. His support of the Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and Civil Rights Act reflects his determined concern for equality and righteousness for all. I had asked Ham to serve on the Board of Directors of the Legal Services Corporation, but unfortunately his health kept him from accepting that nomination. Ham will be remembered for his efforts on behalf all Americans and especially for his service to the people of New York's 19th District. Our prayers are with his family and friends in this time.
