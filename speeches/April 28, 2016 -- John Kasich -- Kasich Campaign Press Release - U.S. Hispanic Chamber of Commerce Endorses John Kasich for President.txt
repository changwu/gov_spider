The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC), the largest Hispanic business organization in the country, has officially endorsed . . . Ohio Gov. John Kasich for the GOP's ticket.

In the Republican field, the USHCC formally endorsed Kasich, recognizing the Ohio governor as someone who has consistently fought for policies encouraging economic growth. The USHCC acknowledged Kasich's efforts as a policymaker to balance the federal budget in 1997, closing Ohio's $8 billion budget shortfall and creating over 425,000 jobs in the private sector.
"Governor Kasich earns our endorsement because, unlike his primary opponents, he has a proven ability to unite people across party lines, and has a track record of enacting bold, comprehensive policies to solve the problems that matter to Hispanic business owners, and all Americans," said Palomarez.
In regards to both Clinton and Kasich endorsements, the USHCC made a swipe at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, a businessman based from New York City. Palomarez recognized there is a lot at stake in the upcoming presidential election and Americans cannot let the U.S. divide further.
"There is so much at stake in this election and our country cannot afford to have those who would divide our nation and prey on the fears of the American people as our President," said Palomarez. "By way of example, Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric toward women, immigrants, the disabled, Muslims, and the Hispanic community not only divides our country, but sends a clear message that Hispanic voters won't forget: he does not stand with our community."
