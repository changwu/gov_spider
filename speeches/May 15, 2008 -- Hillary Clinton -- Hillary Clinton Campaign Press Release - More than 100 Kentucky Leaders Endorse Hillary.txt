    After a decisive victory in West Virginia, the Clinton Campaign today announced its Kentucky Steering Committee, made up of more than a hundred leaders across the state that are endorsing Hillary for President.
"We are honored to have the support of so many respected community leaders throughout Kentucky, all dedicated to making Hillary successful in Tuesday's primary," said State Director Jonathan Hurst.
Today's announcement is the latest example of Hillary's growing momentum across the Bluegrass State. The campaign has opened offices across Kentucky, and Hillary, former President Clinton, and Chelsea have actively campaigned throughout the state.
