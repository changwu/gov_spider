    Hillary Clinton released the following statement today after Feminist Majority endorsed her campaign for President.
"I am honored to earn the endorsement of Feminist Majority. Under the leadership of my friend Ellie Smeal, Feminist Majority has been a tireless advocate in the fight for women's equality. They have helped not only to elect more women to office, but to advance issues that are important to women and families across the country. They've championed pay equity and policies to confront domestic abuse. They've worked to expand economic opportunity including reproductive rights for all women. Today, women's health and rights are under attack like never before. The stakes could not be higher in this election, and the work groups like Feminist Majority do every day is vital in helping to build a better future for all our daughters and granddaughters. As President, I will proudly work alongside Feminist Majority to continue to build on the progress we've made and fight against any attempts to take us back."
