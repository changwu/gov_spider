    Boston, MA â€“ Mitt Romney made the following statement on the third quarter GDP report:
"Today, we received the latest round of discouraging economic news: Last quarter, our economy grew at only two percent, less than half the 4.3% rate the White House projected after passing the stimulus bill. Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay. This is what four years of President Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change -- for growth, for jobs, for higher take-home pay. Paul Ryan and I will deliver it."
