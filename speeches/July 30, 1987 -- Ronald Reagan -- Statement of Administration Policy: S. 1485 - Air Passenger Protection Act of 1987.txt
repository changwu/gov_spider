    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Ford (D) Kentucky and 4 others)
The administration opposes passage of S. 1485 in its current form, because of its overly specific and burdensome requirements. The Department of Transportation is presently engaged in vigorous efforts to develop new procedures to protect the interests of airline passengers. We believe that the nationwide on-time performance reporting requirement incorporated in the bill would be inferior to the targeted reporting contemplated by the Department. Also, FAA standardization of elapsed times would duplicate announced industry reforms. Moreover, the goals of the proposed "notice of fare limitations" in airline advertising can be fulfilled more easily with standardized disclaimers.
Because more useful industry and DOT initiatives are imminent, the Administration opposes passage of S. 1485.
