    The United States of America and the Russian Federation express their full support, commitment, and agreement to collaborate, where appropriate, to promote more open government through dedicated efforts to increase transparency, promote meaningful citizen participation, and foster collaboration between government and the private sector.
Creating a more open government in the 21st century will demonstrate a new spirit of flexibility, innovation, and creativity. It will entail greater use of new communications and e-government technologies that will promote greater participation by citizens, enhanced accountability, and improved transparency for both regulation and spending. This new approach is already reducing paperwork burdens, promoting economic growth, cutting costs, and heightening efficiency for the two governments and the public at large.
As both countries implement their respective plans for open government, we stand ready to share experiences, collaborate on projects in both our national interests, and work with other countries around the globe that are instituting similar reforms.
