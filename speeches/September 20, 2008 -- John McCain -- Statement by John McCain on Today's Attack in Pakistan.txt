    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on today's attack in Pakistan:
"Today's attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad is an outrageous act of violence. Cindy and I express our deepest condolences for the loss of life, and our thoughts and prayers are with those hurt or killed in the attack.
"Today's bombing must serve to deepen the resolve of Americans and Pakistanis alike to aggressively confront those terrorist groups that seek our destruction. While no organization has yet taken responsibility for this act, it is well known that Pakistan faces an enduring threat from violent Islamic extremism. We must work with the elected government of Pakistan to find those responsible, hold them accountable, and diminish their ability to threaten us and our allies in the future. It also serves as one more demonstration of the need for the next President to work closely with our partners and allies in order to counter the dangers posed by radical Islamic extremism."
