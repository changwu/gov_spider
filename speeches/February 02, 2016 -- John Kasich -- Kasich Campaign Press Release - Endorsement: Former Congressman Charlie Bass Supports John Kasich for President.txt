    Today former New Hampshire Congressman Charlie Bass announced his support for Ohio Governor John Kasich for president. Congressman Bass will serve as a state co-chair for the Kasich for America campaign in New Hampshire.
Said Bass, "I served in Congress alongside Governor Kasich and can vouch for him as a man of courage and substance. His vision for lifting people by enacting common-sense reforms appeals to a wide audience here in New Hampshire. John Kasich has gone to incredible lengths to win over primary voters these past few months, and I'm confident that we will see his hard work pay off next week."
Bass represented New Hampshire's second congressional district from 1995 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2013. He currently serves as a consultant to renewable energy companies.
"I'm humbled by the endorsement of former Congressman Charlie Bass, who understands New Hampshire voters as well as anyone. I know from the years we served in Congress together that we share the same commitment to solving problems and working to unite rather than divide. It's an honor to earn his support as we make our final push in New Hampshire."
