    Today's terrorist bombings in Amman were cowardly attacks on innocent Jordanians and their guests. These barbaric acts again demonstrated the terrible cruelty of the terrorists and the great toll they take on civilized society. I send my prayers and condolences and those of the American people to the families of all those killed in these attacks and to those who were wounded. To the people of Jordan and King Abdullah, we pledge our full support in their efforts to bring the terrorists to justice. Jordan is a key ally in the war on terror and will have all assistance we can offer.
