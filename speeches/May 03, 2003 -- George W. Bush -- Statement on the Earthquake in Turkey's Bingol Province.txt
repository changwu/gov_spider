    I extend my condolences to those injured and to the families of the victims of the recent earthquake in Turkey's Bingol Province. I am particularly saddened by the number of children who were killed and injured. The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with those directly affected by this tragedy and with the entire Turkish nation. The United States stands ready to help in any way possible.
