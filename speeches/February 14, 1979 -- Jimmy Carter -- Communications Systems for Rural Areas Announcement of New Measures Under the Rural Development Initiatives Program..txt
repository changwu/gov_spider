    The President today announced initiatives designed to overcome isolation in rural areas through modern communications technology.
The communications initiatives include FCC regulatory changes, a loan program to encourage telephone companies to provide television and associated broadband services to rural residents, and a number of demonstration grants. They are intended to encourage the use of modern communications systems in bringing health, education, information, and entertainment services to small towns and rural areas.
The communications initiatives are the latest to be announced in conjunction with the White House Rural Development Initiatives program. Along with recently announced measures dealing with health care and water and sewer programs, today's announcement is part of the administration's effort, articulated in the State of the Union message sent to Congress last month, to address the problems to rural America.
Coordination of the communications initiatives will be carried out by the Interagency Committee on Telecommunications.
