    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards today issued the following statement on the National Summit on America's Silent Epidemic, where North Carolina Governor Mike Easley will discuss the crisis of high school dropouts and describe North Carolina's education reforms.
"Our failure to help all of our children finish high school is shocking. As many as one-third of all students drop out of school, and the rates are even worse for poor and minority students. At nearly 1,000 high schools, students have less than an even chance of graduating. Most of these students quickly regret it.
"America is about second chances. As president, I will create second-chance schools to help former dropouts get back on track with one-on-one attention and a chance to earn a diploma at night or at a local community college. I will also invest in expanding preschool programs, attracting and paying excellent teachers, and making college more affordable.
"I am proud of North Carolina's tradition of leading the way on school reform. I congratulate Gov. Easley for taking a leadership role in addressing our nation's dropout crisis."
The daylong conference in Washington, D.C., today was organized by the National Governors Association, Civic Enterprises, MTV, TIME, and the Gates Foundation.
