    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Roukema (R) New Jersey and 11 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5001, which would establish a Citizen Advisory Commission for the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. The bill is premature in that the National Park Service is already cooperating with concerned states and local jurisidictions to address issues raised by management plans prepared for the Area. The effort to collaborate informally with outside interests should be given a chance to work before establishing a formal advisory commission. If later determined to be more appropriate, the Secretary of the Interior can establish and appoint such a body under existing law.
