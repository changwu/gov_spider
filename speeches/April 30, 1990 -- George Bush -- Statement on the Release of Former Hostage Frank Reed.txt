    We are pleased that hostage Frank Reed has been freed by his captors. Mr. Reed had been held hostage for nearly 4 years. This is a joyous day for Mr. Reed, his family, his friends, and all Americans. With Mr. Reed's release, we have six innocent Americans that are still being held hostage in Lebanon. In addition, there are a number of foreign nationals that are being held hostage. Their predicament weighs on our mind and tempers the joy we feel today by Mr. Reed's release.
Once again, we wish to express our gratitude to all those who through their efforts helped in Mr. Reed's release. In particular, we would like to thank the Government of Syria for facilitating this release. We would also like to thank the Government of Iran for using its influence to help bring about this humanitarian step. We cannot rest, however, until all hostages are free. We urge all parties who either hold hostages or have any influence over the hostage-takers to work for the expeditious and unconditional release of the remaining hostages.
