    Governor Mitt Romney
NBC's "Today"
October 10, 2007
NBC's Matt Lauer: "Governor Mitt Romney, a native son of Michigan is still in Dearborn, Michigan, this morning. Governor, good morning to you."
Governor Mitt Romney: "Good morning, Matt."
Lauer: "Nice to see you. So let's talk about this exchange between you and Mayor Giuliani. You guys teed off against each other on the subject of spending, the line-item veto, and in particular, on cutting taxes. He says that as Mayor of New York he lowered taxes. He says that as Governor of Massachusetts you raised taxes. You say the opposite is true, that you lowered taxes. So, only one of you can be right. How do you think that the average voter should sort this out?"
Governor Romney: "Well, I don't think the average voter's going to be able to go through the statistics and, frankly, both of us lowered taxes, both of us tried to rein in spending. But there are some things that are pretty clear. One is he opposed the line-item veto, took it all the way to the Supreme Court. I think it's the key thing for a President to be able to rein in spending. And the other is, in Mayor Giuliani's case, he fought to put in place or to keep in place a commuter tax which cost some $400 million for people to commute into New York City. That I think is a real mistake. And finally, the Mayor of New York City that followed Mayor Giuliani said that he was left with an enormous deficit. And that's not something which I think bodes well for his campaign."
