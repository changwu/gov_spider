    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 202(c) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Request Act.
This proposed Fiscal Year 1999 Budget represents the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor, the Council of the District of Columbia, and the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority. It also meets the financial stability and management improvement objectives of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. For Fiscal Year 1999, the District estimates revenues of $5.230 billion and total expenditures of $5.189 billion resulting in a $41 million budget surplus.
My transmittal of the District of Columbia's budget, as required by law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
