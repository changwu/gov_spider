    Today, business leaders called on Congress to take action to avoid defaulting on the national debt, writing that "Failure to resolve the current impasse could easily have more negative consequences. Although the American economy is generally strong, high inflation has created stresses in our financial system, including several recent bank failures."
They also noted that "Much worse will occur if the nation defaults on our debt obligations, which would weaken our position in the world financial system."
As President Biden has made clear, default would be catastrophic for the American people and is not an option. It is time for Congress to act.

Partnerships for New York City: Open Letter to the President & Congressional Leaders from Concerned Business Leaders[5/16/23]
Dear President Biden, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Minority Leader McConnell, House Speaker McCarthy and House Minority Leader Jeffries,
Since its founding, the United States has held honoring its debts as among its most important governing principles. In recent years, that commitment has been challenged from time to time as Congress has periodically increased the limit on the nation's overall indebtedness to accommodate persistent budget deficits. At present, the country is facing another such challenge.
We write to emphasize the potentially disastrous consequences of a failure by the federal government to meet its obligations. Absent a resolution, the government is likely to run out of money as soon as June 1. Action to end the pending debt crisis is necessary now.
The closest the U.S. has come to default was in 2011. As the likelihood of default increased, Standard & Poor's took away the United States' hallowed AAA rating (which has still not been restored). An agreement to raise the ceiling was reached two days before the federal government would have defaulted, but the stock market still lost 17% of its value for more than a year. Moody's reported that the heightened uncertainty from this crisis resulted in 1.2 million fewer jobs, a 0.7 percentage point higher unemployment rate, and a $180 billion smaller economy than it otherwise would have—dire impacts that occurred without an actual default.
Failure to resolve the current impasse could easily have more negative consequences. Although the American economy is generally strong, high inflation has created stresses in our financial system, including several recent bank failures. Much worse will occur if the nation defaults on our debt obligations, which would weaken our position in the world financial system. Large amounts of our $31 trillion debt are held by pension funds, individuals, and other governments. The inability to incur new debt would also threaten the government's ability to pay its other bills, potentially including some payments to Social Security or Medicare recipients. This cannot be allowed to happen.
We strongly urge that an accord be reached quickly so that the country can avert this potentially devasting scenario.
Sincerely,
