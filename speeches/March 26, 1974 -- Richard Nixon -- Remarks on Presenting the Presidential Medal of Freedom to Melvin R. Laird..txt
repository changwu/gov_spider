I suppose, incidentally, that the midshipmen here, this is the first time you have seen the Medal of Freedom awarded. It is not an award that is given lightly; it is one that is given to distinguished former members of the Cabinet, to leaders of the Nation in many fields. It is the highest civilian award that this Government can provide.
[At this point, the President read the following citation:
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AWARDS THIS
PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM
TO
MELVIN R. LAIRD
Few men have served America better than Melvin R. Laird. As a promising young State Senator, as an outstanding member of the United States Congress for sixteen years, as Secretary of Defense and as Presidential Counsellor for Domestic Affairs, he has superbly demonstrated a love of country, a strong capability for leadership and a brilliant understanding of people and ideas. Lawmaker, administrator, theorist and master of the American political process, Melvin Laird has helped to preserve a strong, free United States and has left an indelible mark on the history of our times.]
