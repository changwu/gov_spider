    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
As reported on July 13, in response to the security situation in South Sudan, I ordered the deployment of additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel to South Sudan to support the security of U.S. personnel and of our Embassy in Juba and the pre-positioning in Djibouti of additional U.S. Armed Forces prepared to support the security of U.S. citizens and property in South Sudan. Beginning on July 14, 2016, up to approximately 200 U.S. Armed Forces with appropriate combat equipment, including those forces initially pre-positioned in Djibouti, are pre-positioning in Uganda for this purpose.
It is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to support the security of U.S. citizens and property in South Sudan.
I have directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.
Sincerely,

BARACK OBAMA
