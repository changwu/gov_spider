    I AM TODAY announcing the appointment of Robert C. Moot as Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration. Mr. Moot will serve under Bernard Boutin, who was appointed Administrator last May.
I am ever-mindful of the need for a dynamic, independent Federal agency to serve this Nation's 5 million small businesses. Under Mr. Boutin, the Small Business Administration is filling this need. Mr. Moot brings exceptional ability and broad experience to the Agency's top management team.
Until he came to SBA he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics Services in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He was responsible for policy planning and program management in the Defense Department for the logistics functions of transportation, warehousing, telecommunications, and food service.
In addition, he was responsible for Defense-wide management on the Defense cost reduction program, as well as the logistics indices program, which measure progress against goals for all logistics programs.
In short, Mr. Moot is one of those vital cogs in sound, effective government--a professional manager. I have determined that each Federal dollar will be spent with maximum effectiveness, and that all Federal programs will be tightly run to achieve precise goals.
Mr. Moot has had a long and distinguished career of Federal service. He has been Comptroller of the Defense Supply Agency, which worked to standardize Defense procurement, and Staff Director for Material Management in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
He has also served as Comptroller of the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, Navy Department.
He served in the Army during World War II. A native of New Jersey, he attended public schools there, and Dana College. He has received the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the DSA Exceptional Civilian Service Award, and the DSA Meritorious Civilian Service Award. Mr. Moot is married and has three children. He lives in Annandale, Va.
