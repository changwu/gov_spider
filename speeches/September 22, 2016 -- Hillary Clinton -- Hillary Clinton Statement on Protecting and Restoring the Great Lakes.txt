    Today, ahead of the Great Lakes Restoration Conference, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement: 
"The Great Lakes are national treasures–powering regional economies, providing drinking water to tens of millions of Americans, and providing unparalleled outdoor recreation. But the Great Lakes are facing serious stresses, from pollution to toxic algal blooms to the spread of invasive species.
"Clean water is not a luxury–it's a basic right of all Americans. As President, I will fight to protect drinking water, including by investing in modernizing our outdated drinking and wastewater infrastructure, and supporting the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.
"And I will promote conservation and collaborative stewardship of our natural resources, including the Great Lakes. I will set a goal of doubling the size of the outdoor economy within a decade–which will benefit communities all around the Great Lakes. And I will support collaborative approaches to protect our environment, like the agreement between Ohio, Michigan, and Ontario to reduce nutrient pollution that contributes to harmful algal blooms.
"Together, we can protect the Great Lakes and America's public lands and waters for future generations."
