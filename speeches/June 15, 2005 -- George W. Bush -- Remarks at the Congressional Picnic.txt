    Thank you all for coming tonight. I think we're going to have a pretty special picnic here on the South Lawn. Laura and Lynne and Dick and I are really pleased you're here. It's a chance to say thanks to the Members of Congress and their families.
I appreciate the Marine Band. I hope you've enjoyed them as much as I've enjoyed listening to them upstairs.
So, enjoy the food. In about 45 minutes or so, we're going to have a celebration of American musicals, at the tent down there below. We hope you join us. WETA is going to film it, so make sure you look pretty. [Laughter]
But thanks for coming. May God bless you all and your families. Glad you're here.
