    (New York, NY) February 26th, 2016 â€” Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of Maine Governor Paul R. LePage. This announcement comes immediately following the endorsement of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
Mr. Trump stated, "I am proud to receive Governor LePage's endorsement. He will be a great asset as we continue to campaign across the country, and I'm grateful for his support."
"I am pleased today to announce my endorsement of Donald J. Trump, the next President of the United States," said Governor LePage. "Mr. Trump is the only candidate who is funding his own campaign and who will break the grip special interests now have on Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump's successful business record demonstrates he can create jobs for out-of-work Americans. Instead of delivering favors for corporate donors, like the other candidates in this race, he will fight to improve the lives of the American people."
"Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has talked about bringing back our manufacturing jobs, returning foreign investments to the United States and finally securing our immigration system," added Governor LePage. "Here in Maine, we have seen firsthand the burdens imposed by politicians who allow illegal immigrants to take advantage of our hardworking taxpayers. Mr. Trump is the only candidate talking about reducing these burdens and helping Americans first."
