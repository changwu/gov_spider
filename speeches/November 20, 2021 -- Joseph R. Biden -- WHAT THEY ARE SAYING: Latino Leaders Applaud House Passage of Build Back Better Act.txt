    Following the House passage of the Build Back Better Act, Latino leaders applauded how the historic legislation will address systemic inequities by cutting the cost of child care access, lowering health care costs, and bringing immigration relief to many all while creating good-paying, union jobs and dealing everybody into the economy.
As Nobel Prize-winning economists and independent ratings agencies have confirmed, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Act are fully paid for, will reduce the deficit, and ease inflationary pressures by making the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay their fair share and stopping them from cheating on their tax bills.
Latino leaders from across the country are applauding the passage of the historic legislation through the House and urging the Senate to take urgent action so President Biden can sign it into law and ensure we can build back better.

The measure will extend the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and summer nutrition programs and establish universal pre-K.

It will be the largest effort to combat climate change in history. It will cut taxes for tens of millions of middle class families. It is the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade.

From lowering the cost of prescription medications and expanding access to affordable health care, to lowering taxes for millions of families, to providing assistance so that mothers no longer need choose between having a family or having a career, the Build Back Better Act is truly transformative. The bill will also invest in the protection of our planet, so that one day, life expectancy won't be determined by your zip code. The bill does all this without raising taxes on anyone but the ultra-wealthy, who will finally be asked to pay their fair share. We look forward to working with leadership in the U.S. Senate to see the bill passed and signed into law." [Statement, 11/19/21]
