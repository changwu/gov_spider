    Today, Biden for President announced Kamala Harris's guests for the vice presidential debate tonight held in Salt Lake City, Utah: State Rep. Angela Romero of Salt Lake City, Utah and Deborah Gatrell of West Valley City, Utah.
State Rep. Angela Romero was first elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 2012, and is a longtime community organizer advancing progressive causes, equality and social justice. She currently oversees community programs in the Division of Youth and Family Programs and strives to make her neighborhood that she represents better, all as a working mother raising her son. Rep. Romero remains focused on protecting essential workers and providing support for families and local businesses affected by COVID-19.
Deborah Gatrell is a veteran and full-time teacher at Hunter High School currently running for Salt Lake County Council. Deborah is a Blackhawk pilot with 21 years of service in the Utah National Guard and has deployed to a combat zone in the Middle East. She looks forward to working with local leaders and community members to find solutions and ensure the long-term recovery of west side communities that have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Senator Harris's debate night guests represent the people she and Joe Biden will fight for in a Biden-Harris Administration, and they both showcase the resolve hard-working Americans have shown as Donald Trump has failed to control the virus and save the economy.
