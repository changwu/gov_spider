    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Simon (D) IL and 12 others)
Poland and Hungary are experiencing truly historic and rapid change in which democratic forces for the first time since World War II are playing the leading role. The United States and the West as a whole face a unique challenge and opportunity to assist these countries in what we hope will be a peaceful and successful transformation from state-controlled economic and political systems to political pluralism, democracy, and market economies.
From the outset of his Administration, President Bush has taken the lead in, supporting reform in Poland and Hungary and has worked with Congress to ensure that comprehensive legislation is enacted on an urgent basis. The President's policy has been flexible to account for changing circumstances; conditional to provide incentives for macroeconomic reform; and has provided U.S. leadership in developing a concerted Western approach since no one country can provide all that Poland and Hungary need.
S. 1582 incorporates many elements of the President's program.
The Administration opposes S. 1582 unless the bill's excessive and inappropriate funding levels are modified to conform with the President's request. S. 1582 must also be amended to eliminate constraints on the President's constitutional authority to oversee the Nation's foreign affairs.
