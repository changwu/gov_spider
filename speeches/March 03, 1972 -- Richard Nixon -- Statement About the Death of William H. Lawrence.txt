    BILL LAWRENCE was one of the most independent and highly respected members of the national political press corps, always tough-minded in his search for the facts.
His death was most untimely and tragic, but it came on an assignment symbolic of his long career in the snows of New Hampshire covering the start of yet another national political campaign. He will be greatly missed by all who have followed his reports over the years.
