Las Vegas, NV -- Today, former city councilman and mayor pro tem of North Las Vegas Theron Goynes and retired educator Naomi Goynes announced their endorsement of Cory Booker for president.
"We are proud to fully put our support behind Cory Booker for president because we know that he will fight for communities like ours in North Las Vegas - a city still recovering from the Great Recession," stated Theron Goynes, former councilman and mayor pro tem of North Las Vegas, and Naomi Goynes, retired educator. "Cory has a deep and unique understanding of the issues critical to the Black community - from the housing discrimination that his parents faced to the gun violence that sadly still afflicts his neighborhood in Newark. Senator Booker has demonstrated his ability to lead and bring people together while he was Mayor of Newark as he helped bring the city out of an economic crisis and in the U.S. Senate where he was instrumental in the passage of comprehensive criminal justice reform. We know that Cory Booker is the candidate who will unite and heal this country."
