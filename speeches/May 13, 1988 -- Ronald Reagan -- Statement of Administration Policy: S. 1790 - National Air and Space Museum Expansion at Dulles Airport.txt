    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Garn (R) Utah and 30 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1790, because the authorization of appropriations related to National Air and Space Museum facilities at Washington Dulles International Airport is premature in light of other options currently under consideration.
