    We appreciate that House and Senate leaders have come together with a strong bill that builds upon the recently passed UN Security Council Resolution, grants the President new authority, and strengthens a multilateral strategy to isolate and pressure Iran. We will continue to work with the Congress over the coming days as it finalizes work on this important bill, and in our ongoing efforts to hold Iran accountable. As that effort progresses, we will also work with our allies and take independent action under the Presidentâ€™s existing authorities, as we did last week in designating additional entities for sanctions.
