Out-of-town pool report #8 — Crist reception
The hosts of this reception are Scott and Annie Schlesinger.
After initially mingling inside, the audience of roughly 70 guests came out to the patio and lawn area, where a blue-tiled pool sits between the house and the Atlantic. Audience members have refreshments in hand, and canapés are being served by the poolside bar.
Scott Schlesinger spoke first, acknowledging the race is an uphill climb for Democrats, followed by Crist, who offered very brief remarks.
"Florida deserves so much better, and I know that in my heart, Floridians know that too," Crist said.
POTUS followed, speaking on the patio alongside Crist and Schlesinger, facing the ocean, behind a red velvet rope barrier.
He called the Florida governor's race "one of the most important races in the country."
POTUS recalled the effects of the Charlottesville Nazi rally and said he ran for president to restore "the soul of America," bipartisanship and a sense of unity throughout the country.
"Charlie is running against Donald Trump incarnate. This guy doesn't fit any of the categories I talked about. The way he deals, the way he denies," POTUS said.
"I always say democracy is on the ballot. I really mean it," he added.
POTUS said there hasn't been such widespread rejection of democracy in America since the Civil War.
He pointed to the GOP response to the attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband as an example of how broken the Republican Party has become.
"Look at the response of Republicans, making jokes about it," he said.
"The guy purchases a hammer to knee cap" the No. 2 in the line of succession, and yet no one in Republican Party leadership condemned it, he said.
"These guys are extremely extreme," he said.
He recalled sitting down between France's Emmanuel Macron and the UK's Boris Johnson and saying "America is back," and them responding by asking, "how long?"
"The rest of the world is looking at us, Charlie. They're looking at us," POTUS said.
"It is really important that a state the size of Florida… comes down on the right side of history," he said.
POTUS also said that reproductive rights are on the ballot.
No one knows precisely when begins, he said. "And yet you have there candidates out there saying a decision should be made between a woman, her doctor, and their local elected official," he said.
"You're a powerful state," he said of Florida. "You matter."
POTUS wrapped after speaking for roughly 24 minutes.
"Lots on the ballot. This is a genuine inflection point in our country," he said.
As always, please check quotes against the transcript.
