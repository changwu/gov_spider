    To the Congress of the United States:
On July 10, 1979, I issued a Proclamation pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 by which I implemented Standby Energy Conservation Contingency Plan No. 2 and imposed emergency building temperature restrictions, effective July 16, 1979. On April 15, 1980, I issued a Proclamation which continued those emergency building temperature restrictions until January 16, 1981.
I have now issued the attached Proclamation which renews the required statutory findings and continues the Plan in effect until October 16, 1981, unless sooner rescinded.
