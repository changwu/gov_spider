    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Wilson (R) NM and 8 cosponsors)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act, which provides liability protection for government contractors and the nuclear industry and assures prompt and equitable compensation for the public in the unlikely event of a nuclear accident. The Administration commends the House for its efforts to extend Price-Anderson's important indemnification objectives. To assure the future of nuclear energy, liability coverage must continue for nuclear activities conducted by the Department of Energy and by licensees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers of both.
The Administration remains committed to enacting legislation that will reauthorize the Price-Anderson Act in its current form, and looks forward to working with Congress to improve provisions in the bill concerning financial accountability, safety, and security. The Administration hopes to work with Congress to ensure that the bill achieves its intended effect without detracting from the quality of potential contractors, fostering unnecessary regulations, or compromising security, anti-terrorism, or non-proliferation efforts.
