    Richardson calls for redeploying all U.S. troops from Iraq
INDIANOLA, IA-- Speaking to a crowd of over 12,000 at the 30th Harkin Steak Fry, Democratic Presidential candidate and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson emphasized that he is the Presidential candidate who offers caucus-goers both change and experience.
"Iowans know that the candidate our party sends to the White House must be someone with real-world experience to bring about real change," Governor Richardson said. "We do not need nostalgia. We do not need on-the-job training. We need proven leadership with real results."
Governor Richardson's appearance at the Harkin Steak Fry capped a four-day trip to Iowa during which he held town hall discussions on the Iraq war. Governor Richardson repeatedly has called for ending the war and redeploying all U.S. troops from Iraq.
"The Richardson plan to end the war starts with a simple premise: Redeploy all of our troops, who have served so honorably, from Iraq -- all of them -- and deploy them where they are needed, leaving no residual forces behind," Governor Richardson said. "It is the only way to end this tragic war. Only with a complete withdrawal can we move toward a political and diplomatic solution in Iraq, not beforehand."
During his visit to Iowa -- his second this month -- Governor Richardson visited 16 communities: Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Orange City, Sibley, Spencer, Spirit Lake, Estherville, Forest City, Manly, Mason City, Charles City, Allison, Hampton, Clarion, Perry, and Indianola.
A mid-August poll by the ONE Campaign of likely Iowa caucus-goers shows Governor Richardson just five points behind Barack Obama.
