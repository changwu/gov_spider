    I am pleased to be signing H.R. 8588, a bill to reorganize and consolidate audit and investigation functions and to create offices of Inspector General in 12 major domestic departments and agencies. I think it is a reflection on the importance of this legislation that the final version of the bill was approved by unanimous votes in the Senate and House.
The new offices created by the bill will consolidate existing audit and investigation resources trader the direction of a single, presidentially appointed Inspector General in each agency. By combining these resources under an Inspector General, who will be directly accountable to the agency head, the Inspectors General will be of prime importance to my administration in our continuing, concerted effort to root out fraud, abuse, and waste in agency programs. Over the long term, this legislation will be of great value to this administration's commitment to improving economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and integrity in the administration of Federal programs.
I can assure the Congress that the new framework established by the bill will be put to a good and vigorous use. I intend to nominate people of the highest integrity and ability to head these offices, and I will instruct my department and agency heads to support their efforts fully.
We are pleased to have worked with the Congress in fashioning this legislation. The reorganization of audit and investigation activities complements other initiatives the administration has under way to fight fraud and abuse in Government, including the strong whistleblower protection provisions in the civil service reform bill and the aggressive investigations we have launched of alleged abuses in GSA operations and CETA job programs.
I commend Representatives Fountain and Brooks and Senators Eagleton and Ribicoff for their dedicated work in the development and refinement of this bill.
