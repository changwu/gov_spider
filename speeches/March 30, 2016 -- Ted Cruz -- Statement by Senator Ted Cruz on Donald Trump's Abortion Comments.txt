    HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz issued the following statement in response to Donald Trump's comments to MSNBC in favor of punishing women who have an abortion if they were banned:
"Once again Donald Trump has demonstrated that he hasn't seriously thought through the issues, and he'll say anything just to get attention. On the important issue of the sanctity of life, what's far too often neglected is that being pro-life is not simply about the unborn child; it's also about the mother — and creating a culture that respects her and embraces life. Of course we shouldn't be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world."
