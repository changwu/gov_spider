So RJC' exec dir Matt Brooks tells Rubio he answered 85% of Q's his speech with his "terrific speech."

.@marcorubio ready for Q's at #RJCForum, though "you answered about 85% of them in your speech," they note. Rubio V. policy-specific here

This specificity from Rubio on what he'd do/has done for Israel = a mic drop at end of very successful RJC speech. pic.twitter.com/o7hkxCC5Rd

Marco will stand with Israel, reimpose sanctions on Iran, and defeat ISIS — that foreign policy vision is exactly why he was received so well today.
