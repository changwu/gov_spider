"Still, Clinton's's record on the drug problem is very soft. Newsweek has learned that FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote a scathing memo 18 months ago to complain about the lack of 'any true leadership' in stemming the influx of heroin and cocaine, which Freeh compared to an 'all-conquering army,' Freeh then hand-delivered the memo to Clinton himself -- a bold move."
