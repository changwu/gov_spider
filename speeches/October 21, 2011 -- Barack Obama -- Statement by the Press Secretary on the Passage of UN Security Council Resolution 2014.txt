    We applaud the strong action taken today by the United Nations Security Council in unanimously adopting Resolution 2014, which addresses the ongoing crisis in Yemen. The United States co-sponsored the resolution, which calls for President Saleh to sign and implement a political settlement on the basis of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative without delay, demands all parties refrain from violence, and urges authorities to protect the universal rights of Yemen's citizens.
Over the past nine months, the Yemeni people have braved repression and violence to demand a more just, accountable, and democratic government. Today the international community sent a united and unambiguous signal to President Saleh that he must respond to the aspirations of the Yemeni people by transferring power immediately. Each day that passes without a political solution plunges Yemen deeper into turmoil. We continue to believe that only a Yemeni-led process will stop the bloodshed and allow the country to confront its serious economic, humanitarian, and security challenges. The United States stands with the Yemeni people, and we will work with international partners to provide much-needed assistance to Yemen upon implementation of a political transition.
