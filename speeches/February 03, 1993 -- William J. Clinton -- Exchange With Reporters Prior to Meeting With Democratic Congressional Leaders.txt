    Q. Mr. President, when do you want campaign's finance reforms to go into effect.'?
The President. We're here to talk about what's going to be in the bill. I want to pass a bill early this year, as early as we can, and we're going to talk about that.
There was a good bill last year—it had a lot of good features in it—which was vetoed by President Bush. And I guess we'll start talking about that and see where we go from there. But I hope we can get a good bill.
In terms of when it goes into effect, and the last bill skipped an election cycle and was widely applauded by all the public interest groups as a great advance over where we are now. I think when it goes into effect is a subject of discussion here. But I want to pass a good bill. That's my concern.
