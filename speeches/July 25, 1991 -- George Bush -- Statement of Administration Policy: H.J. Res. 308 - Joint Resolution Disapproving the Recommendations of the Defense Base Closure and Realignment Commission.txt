    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/26/91)(House)(Foglietta (D) PA and six others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 308 and urges Congress to continue its support of the bipartisan approach on base realignments and closures provided by Public Law 101-510. By allowing the Commission's recommendations (which have been approved by the President) to go into effect, national defense will be improved and costs reduced through a more efficient military base structure. Moreover. unneeded Federal land will be restored and put to productive private or public use.
