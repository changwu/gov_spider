    Today a minority in the Senate denied a vote on a spending bill that is 4 months overdue and that fulfills important commitments: commitments to veterans who need health care; to Africans suffering from AIDS; to FBI agents fighting terror; to children learning to read in our Nation's public schools. This bill stays within the spending limits I proposed. And the Senate needs to pass it.
