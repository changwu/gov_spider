Attorney Generals from 21 States are urging the Senate to reject Impeachment. They say the Articles have legal & factual problems, and the Democrats case sets a dangerous historical precedent.

....OF THE 2020 ELECTION BECSUSE IT WEAPONIZES A PROCESS THAT SHOULD ONLY BE INITIATED IN EXCEEDINGLY RARE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES." @HeatherChilders @FoxNews The Democrats are trying hard to damage Republicans prior to the Election!Retweets: 11509Favorites: 44109

In an Impeachment, you can't use a work of fiction as the theory for the case, filling in gaps with presumptions against the President. It was a weak presentation, self indulgent, & he didn't deliver the goods." Robert Charles, @HeatherChilders @FoxNewsRetweets: 13997Favorites: 56753

The Democrat House would not give us lawyers, or not one witness, but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought, or even asked for? They had their chance, but pretended to rush. Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!Retweets: 29246Favorites: 130447

The Democrats & Shifty Schiff, whose presentation to the Senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations, are refusing to state that the Obama Administration withheld aid from many countries including Ukraine, Pakistan, Philippines, Egypt, Honduras, & Mexico.

Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is. By doing this, he figures, they won't hit him as hard....Retweets: 18056Favorites: 80875

....during his hopeless "presidential" campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these "clowns" because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right!Retweets: 11185Favorites: 49931

The Democrats don't want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff, the Biden's, the fake Whistleblower(& his lawyer), the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts), the so-called "informer", & many other Democrat disasters, would be a BIG problem for them!Retweets: 25626Favorites: 101480
