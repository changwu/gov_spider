    Sanders Will Serve As Missouri Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Jackson County Executive Mike Sanders and named him a Co-Chair of Hillary's Missouri campaign.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to get our troops home safely from Iraq and tackle the tough challenges we face at home, from moving toward energy independence to establishing universal healthcare for every American," Sanders said. "Hillary is uniquely qualified to deliver the change this country needs."
Sanders was elected Jackson County Executive in 2006 on a platform of open and transparent government, safe neighborhoods and fiscal responsibility.
Before his election as County Executive, Sanders served two terms as Jackson County Prosecutor from 2002 to 2006, strengthening the county's jailing procedures and expanding the use of DNA testing to convict criminals and solve dozens of 'cold cases.' Sanders also streamlined spending and accountability measures in the county's COMBAT Community Anti-Drug Program.
Responding to record high murder rates in Kansas City in 2005, Sanders spearheaded the 'Silence Is Killing Us' campaign to encourage residents to break their silence and cooperate with local law enforcement to improve neighborhood safety and get criminals off the streets.
Sanders volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army in the early 1990s, rising to the rank of 1st Lieutenant before returning home to earn his law degree and join the County Prosecutor's office.
"Mike has worked tirelessly to make Jackson County a safer and more livable community, and he gets results," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support and delighted that he'll help lead our efforts in Missouri."
