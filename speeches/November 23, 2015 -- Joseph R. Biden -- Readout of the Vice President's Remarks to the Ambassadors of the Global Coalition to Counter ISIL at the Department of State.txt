    Today, the Vice President addressed the Ambassadors of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL at the Department of State. The Vice President expressed his sincere condolences to the friends and families of all those injured or killed in the recent terrorist attacks by ISIL, and thanked Coalition members for their continued commitment to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The Vice President also called on the Coalition to intensify its efforts against ISIL - including increasing airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, helping Syria's neighbors defend their borders, increasing our information sharing and intelligence cooperation to counter foreign fighters and help prevent attacks, supporting the Iraqi government to train its army and police, and providing funding that will increase humanitarian support for the people of Syria and Iraq.
