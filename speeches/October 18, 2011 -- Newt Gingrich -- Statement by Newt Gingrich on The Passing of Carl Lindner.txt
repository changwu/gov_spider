    Las Vegas, NV - Newt and Callista Gingrich released the following statement upon hearing of the death of Carl Lindner:
"Carl Lindner will be deeply missed.
"He was the greatest entrepreneur and philanthropist in Cincinnati's history.
"His rise from delivering milk to presiding over worldwide investments is an American success story that should inspire every young American to believe that if they work hard and learn they too can achieve amazing things.
"His generosity as a citizen is a model of enlightened citizenship. He was a man who knew his success had grown out of his community and who wanted to repay that community. They invested in him. He invested in them.
