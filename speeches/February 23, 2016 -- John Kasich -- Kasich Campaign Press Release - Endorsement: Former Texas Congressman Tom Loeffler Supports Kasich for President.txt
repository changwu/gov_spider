    Today Kasich for America announced that former Texas Congressman Tom Loeffler endorsed Governor John Kasich for President.
Loeffler said: "I served with John Kasich in Congress and saw firsthand his ability to bring people together to get things done and, as governor he's followed the same approach, producing tremendous results. For Republicans looking for a stout conservative who backs up his words with action, the only choice is John Kasich. Governor Kasich erased massive budget deficits, cut taxes and helped produce 400,000 new jobs in Ohio. Those results are what Republicans want to see in Washington. He is a man whose word is his bond."
Congressman Loeffler is a long-time Republican leader who served in leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, served in the White House under President Ford and later under President Reagan, was a founding member of Romney Victory, served as national finance chairman for John McCain and as national finance co-chairman for George W. Bush for President, and in numerous other senior leadership positions in the Republican Party.
