    On #GivingTuesday, we are reminded of the abundant blessings that God has placed in our lives, and we recommit to answering His call to help those in need through acts of compassion and generosity. Together, we are able to support extraordinary and worthy causes while also enriching the lives of our fellow Americans.
The philanthropic and kindhearted spirit of the American people is uniquely woven into the fabric of our Nation. Each day, we hear of remarkable stories of citizens rising to the occasion and assisting a neighbor in need. From helping communities rebuild following disasters to donating time and resources to organizations that help those with special needs, the people of our great country never fail to lift up those who need a helping hand.
As you and your loved ones continue to celebrate the holiday season, I encourage you to seek opportunities this #GivingTuesday to improve the lives of others and your community. Whether it is volunteering at a shelter that provides relief to the hungry and homeless, donating to an organization that supports the men and women of our Armed Forces, or engaging in efforts to promote childhood literacy, you can make a significant impact.
Melania joins me in thanking those who have contributed to the well-being of our country and our fellow Americans. This #GivingTuesday, we reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the human bonds that unite us as one Nation by lifting up our neighbors and pledging our support to those in need.
