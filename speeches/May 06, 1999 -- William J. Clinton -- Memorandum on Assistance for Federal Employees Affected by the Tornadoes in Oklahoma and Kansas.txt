    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by the Tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas
I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses suffered by many as a result of the tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas. Multiple parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and agencies who have Federal civilian employees in designated disaster areas resulting from the tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas and their aftermath to use discretion to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is prevented from reporting for work or faced with a personal emergency because of this disaster and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy also should be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State, or other officials having jurisdiction.
I am also directing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an emergency leave transfer program, which would permit employees in an executive agency to donate their unused annual leave for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies who were adversely affected by the tornadoes and who need additional time off for recovery. In addition, I am directing OPM to provide additional information and assistance to agencies on the program's administration.
