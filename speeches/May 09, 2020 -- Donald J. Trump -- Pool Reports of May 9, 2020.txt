 In town pool report 1: CDC statement
Good morning.
Call time is not until this afternoon (on this extremely unseasonably cold day in DC), but the White House has sent along the following statement:
In response to the AP report on CDC documents:
"The re-opening guidance shared prematurely was in draft form and had not been vetted through the interagency review process. This is an iterative effort to ensure effective, clear guidance is presented to the American people. I had not seen a version of the guidance incorporating interagency and task force input and therefore was not yet comfortable releasing a final work product."
- CDC Director Robert Redfield

In-town pool report 5: Meeting
Pool was brought in to the Cabinet Room around 6:26 p.m., and were inside for just over one minute.
The president introduced those in the room as the Joint Chiefs and said they had had a very productive meeting, which would be continuing after we left.
He said they discussed "various things."
The pool was then ushered out and the president did not answer any shouted questions.
Below is meeting attendees via the White House. Chief of Staff Mark Meadow's seat was empty.
I will send a picture in a second report so you can see how the room was spaced.
