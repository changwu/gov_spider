    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have your letter of August 9, and it is with great pleasure that I accept the invitation you have extended on behalf of the Board of Governors to be the Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross.
Through the years, the American Red Cross has maintained an outstanding record of voluntary humanitarian services, fulfilling with high dedication and skill the obligations of its Congressional Charter. In the time ahead, I look forward to the opportunity of working with you, the Board of Governors and the Red Cross volunteer leadership across the Nation as we continue to meet the emergency and humanitarian needs of all our people.
With personal best wishes,
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[The Honorable Frank Stanton, Chairman, The American National Red Cross, Washington, D.C. 20006]
