During tonight's CNN debate, Marco asked Donald Trump to outline his healthcare policy. His answer? He doesn't have one.

Needless to say, that exchange will be replayed over and over.
Rubio is killing it.#gopdebate

"What is your plan?"@MarcoRubio crushed Trump on healthcare.
21 people in my focus group say Rubio won, 2 say tie, 0 say Trump. #GOPDebate

Rubio smartly exposed Trump's lack of policy depth in that healthcare fight.

Oh. My. God. Rubio just exposed Trump as an empty suit. What is your plan? What is your plan? So your plan is just the lines? Wow
