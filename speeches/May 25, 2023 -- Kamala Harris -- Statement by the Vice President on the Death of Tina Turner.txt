    Tina Turner was a spectacular woman whose life was a testament to all those who believe in what can be, unburdened by what has been.
Her strength, signature voice, and iconic moves inspired millions. An icon, her career was one of the most storied in the history of music. Among countless awards and honors, the "Queen of Rock & Roll" was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame not just once, but twice.
Her life was not free from hardship. Throughout her life, she faced racism, sexism, and domestic violence. As she later put it, experiences that "could have shattered me, instead became fuel for my journey, propelling me upward."
Tina Turner was simply the best.
Today, Doug and I pray for her family and loved ones.
