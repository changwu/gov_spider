    "Here's what I believe from experience, not just philosophy. I believe that you collect more money from lower taxes than you collect from higher taxes. I believe in supply-side tax policies. I believe in it because I saw it work, and I put a lot on the line in order to make it work. … I reduced taxes 23 times."
– Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Remarks On 12 Commitments To The American People, Bedford, NH, 6/11/07
