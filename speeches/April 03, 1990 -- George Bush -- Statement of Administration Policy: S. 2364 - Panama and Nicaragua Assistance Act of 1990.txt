    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Pell (D) Rhode Island)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2364 which authorizes economic assistance to facilitate the transition to democracy in Panama and Nicaragua. However, during its further consideration by Congress, the Administration will seek to amend S. 2364 in a number of respects.
Specifically, the Administration will seek to delete or substantially modify several objectionable provisions which raise constitutional concerns or improperly intrude upon Executive branch prerogatives to manage foreign policy. These include provisions that:

—  direct the President to negotiate certain agreements with the government of Panama or otherwise constrain him in the conduct of foreign negotiations;
—  mandate the establishment of an Agency for International Development (AID) mission in Namibia; and
—  require prior notification or certification to Congress before certain foreign assistance funds r'an La nhi icrated or expended for certain purposes.
