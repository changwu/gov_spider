(Senate)
(Sen. Leahy, D-VT, and 60 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1925 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that first passed the Congress in 1994 and has twice been reauthorized. That Act transformed the Nation's response to violence against women and brought critically needed resources to States and local communities to address these crimes.
The Administration is pleased that S. 1925 continues that bipartisan progress and targets resources to address today's most pressing issues. Sexual assault remains one of the most underreported violent crimes in the country. The bill provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal justice response to sexual assault and to better connect victims with services. The bill also seeks to reduce domestic violence homicides and address the high rates of violence experienced by teens and young adults. Reaching young people through early intervention can break the cycle of violence.
The Administration strongly supports measures in S. 1925 that will bring justice to Native American victims. Rates of domestic violence against Native American women are now among the highest in the United States. The bill builds on the Tribal Law and Order Act – which President Obama signed on July 29, 2010 – to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of tribal justice systems and will provide additional tools to tribal and Federal prosecutors to address domestic violence in Indian country. The Administration also supports the important leadership role of the Office on Violence Against Women and believes that all victims should have access to critically needed services and protections.
