    Huerta will Help Lead Campaign's Hispanic Efforts
Washington, DC -- Hillary Clinton received today the endorsement of human rights leader and community activist Dolores Huerta, the co-founder and President Emeritus of the United Farm Workers of America. Huerta will serve as co-chair of the campaign's Hispanic outreach efforts.
"Throughout her life Hillary has been a strong leader, working for issues that make a difference in every family's life, like education, health care and good paying jobs," said Huerta. "I believe she is the best qualified candidate and the one that's ready to put our country back on track."
Huerta worked with Cesar Chavez for over thirty years until his death in 1993. She helped him fight for fair wages, medical coverage, pension benefits and basic human living conditions for farm workers. She was also among the first voices to speak against the use of toxic pesticides that threaten workers, consumers, and the environment.
Huerta currently serves as President of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, which focuses on community organizing and leadership training for low-income, under-represented communities. In 1993, Dolores was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and received the Ellis Island Medal of Freedom Award. She has also been recognized by Ms. Magazine as "Women of the Year," and by Ladies Home Journal's "100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century." In 1998, Dolores received the United States Presidential Eleanor D. Roosevelt Human Rights Award from President Bill Clinton.
"I am thrilled to receive Dolores Huerta's support" Clinton said. "She has been a tireless advocate for fairness for workers, women and children. I'm humbled to have her support."
