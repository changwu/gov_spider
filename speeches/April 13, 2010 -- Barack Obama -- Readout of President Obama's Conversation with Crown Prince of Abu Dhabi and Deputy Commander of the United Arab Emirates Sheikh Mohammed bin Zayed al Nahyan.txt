    The President and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Commander of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, discussed non-proliferation cooperation and important regional and bilateral issues during the opening dinner of the Nuclear Security Summit. They talked about the UAE's strong commitment to non-proliferation, including the US-UAE Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Agreement as well as close cooperation on port security. They also spoke about the need for Iran to comply with UN Security Council and IAEA resolutions. The two leaders covered other regional priorities including the need for Israelis and Palestinians to immediately begin proximity talks, leading to direct negotiations aimed at ending the conflict with a two-state solution. In addition, they discussed the broadening cooperation between the U.S. and UAE in areas like energy, science, and entrepreneurship. The President looks forward to hosting several Emiratis at the Washington Entrepreneurship Summit later this month.
