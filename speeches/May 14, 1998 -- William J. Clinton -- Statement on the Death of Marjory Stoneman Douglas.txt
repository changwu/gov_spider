    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of America's greatest environmentalists, Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Mrs. Douglas was 103 when I had the honor of awarding her the Medal of Freedom, and throughout her life, she was always ahead of her time. Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our Nation's natural resources, particularly her beloved Florida Everglades. She was both inspiration and mentor for a generation of American conservationists, and her legacy will continue to call us to action on behalf of the environment.
