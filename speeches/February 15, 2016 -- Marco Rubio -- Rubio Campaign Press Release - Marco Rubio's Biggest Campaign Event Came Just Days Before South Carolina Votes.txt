Thousands of South Carolina voters packed into Marco's largest event yet yesterday. This crowd in Easley was just massive.

The venue could only seat about a thousand, but they packed the room with standing crowds and filled the overflow space.

If there was any question about whether Marco's debate win had an impact, it was answered when this crowd showed up.

What happened at the packed rally was notable, too: Marco gave a moving answer to a question from an emotional supporter, and he won the endorsement of the city's mayor, too!
Marco has events in the coming days all across South Carolina. 
Marcomentum? It's back in the "First in the South" primary state.
