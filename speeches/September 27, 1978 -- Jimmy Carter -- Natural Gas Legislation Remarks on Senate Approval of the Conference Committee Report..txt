    THE PRESIDENT. I just talked to Majority Leader Byrd and Senator Jackson, the Vice President, Jim Schlesinger, Frank Moore—all of them very eager to let me know that the Senate voted, I think overwhelmingly, compared to what we had expected, 57 to 42, in favor of the natural gas conference report. And Senator Byrd sent me word that they will work very rapidly on the other two measures that are now completed in the conference committee.
This is a remarkable demonstration of leadership on the part of the men that I've just named, one of the most difficult pieces of legislation that the Congress has ever faced in the history of our country. It's brought together a wide diversity of interests from around the country. I think it proves to our own Nation and to the rest of the world that we in this Government, particularly Congress, can courageously deal with an issue and one that tests our national will and our ability.
We have difficult decisions still left for the House to make. My expectation is that the House will act as it did August-was a year ago—to resolve the energy question and to give us a comprehensive and a valid energy policy.
I'm very grateful for the leadership that has been shown by these men and by the courageous action in the Senate this afternoon.
Thank you very much.
REPORTER. Sir, can you get it through the House if you veto the public works bill?
THE PRESIDENT. I believe we'll get it through the House.
