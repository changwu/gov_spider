    We applaud the results of the conference that concluded today. This was a broad-based gathering of free Iraqis opposed to the tyrannical regime in Baghdad. Free Iraqis came together in this conference to accomplish two objectives: to agree on a statement setting forth their vision of the future of Iraq; and to form a follow-up advisory committee. They accomplished both these objectives. The conference represents a strong statement of aspirations of Iraqis inside Iraq and throughout the world for a better future. We support these aspirations, and we look forward to working together with all Iraqis to achieve them.
