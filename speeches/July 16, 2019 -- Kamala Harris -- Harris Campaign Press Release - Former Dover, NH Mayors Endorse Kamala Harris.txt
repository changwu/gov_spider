    Following Strafford County Town Hall Attended by Over 900 People, Two Former Dover Mayors Throw Support Behind Harris
Buckley and Boc Are the Latest in a String of New Hampshire Endorsements for Harris
Two former Dover mayors are endorsing Senator Kamala Harris following her standing room only town hall in Strafford County, New Hampshire. Citing her 3AM agenda and ability to beat Donald Trump, Mayors William Boc and Jack Buckley said they are excited to throw their support behind Harris.
"For her entire career, Kamala has been a true advocate for American families. Her 3AM agenda, based on the problems keeping folks up at night, will achieve tangible results for Granite Staters and shows a clear vision for the future. On affordable housing, an issue I have worked on my entire life, Kamala has a real plan to help working Americans afford their rent," said Former Dover Mayor Jack Buckley. "More so, Kamala knows how to hold bad actors accountable, and I'm confident she is the best candidate to restore integrity and truth to the White House. I am proud to endorse her candidacy for President."
"Simply put, Kamala is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in the general election. She has real solutions for many of the problems facing Granite State families, including our children's public education and ensuring men and women are paid equally," said Former Dover Mayor William E. Boc. "She has spent her whole life defending our American values, and she will make a phenomenal president."
Both of Harris' July 14 events had overflow crowds, with more than 400 attending a house party in Gilford and more than 900 packing the cafeteria and gym at Somersworth High School.
Harris has received numerous New Hampshire endorsements since the first Democratic debate, including New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Joe Keefe, State Representatives Dick Ames and Linda Tanner, Co-Chair of the NHDP Senior Caucus Pam Jorgensen, and former State Rep. Lisa DiMartino.
