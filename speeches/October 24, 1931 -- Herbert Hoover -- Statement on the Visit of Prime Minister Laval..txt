    THE PRESIDENT said:
"The President of the Council of Ministers of France has done us great honor in coming to our country, especially so in these times of grave responsibilities. I am confident that his visit will be profitable in results for the future.
"I need not repeat that the purpose of our conversations has been to find fields from which contribution can be made to enlargement of confidence in the relations between nations and in the economic world. I have on some occasions stated that the world is suffering more from frozen confidence than from frozen securities.
"The press plays a major part in the development of the good will on which such confidence must rest by its search for fields in which cooperation and constructive action can be evolved. I trust that you of the French press may carry away with you pleasant recollections of your visit and that you will realize the good will and friendliness of the American people."
