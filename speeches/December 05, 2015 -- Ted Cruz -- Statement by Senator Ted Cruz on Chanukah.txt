HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement on the eve of Chanukah:
"Today Heidi and I wish the Jewish Community a very Happy Chanukah. On this holiday, we remember the miracle that enabled a freedom-loving people – led by the heroic Maccabees – to defeat the oppressive dictator Antiochus so that they could once again freely worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For the eight days of Chanukah, the Jewish people commemorate their liberation from oppression and the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem. As the Talmud teaches, God delivered 'many into the hands of the few, strong into the hands of the weak, and evildoers into the hands of the righteous.'
"Today, the Jewish people, together with freedom-loving people around the world, once again find their religious faith and liberty under attack from radical forces of oppression and intolerance. Whether it is the BDS movement on college campuses, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe, or radical Islamic terror in Israel and around the world, we need modern-day Maccabees to stand together and push back against the forces of evil. As a nation founded by a people seeking religious liberty, America stands with the Jewish people both at home and abroad in protecting the light of faith and liberty.
"The victory of the people of Israel is a testament to God's providence. On these nights when Jewish families around the country and the world celebrate with latkes, lighting the menorah, and playing dreidel, Heidi and I join with you to recognize, 'Nes Gadol Hayah Sham,' a great miracle happened there. We only need look at our nation's heritage to know that great miracles have happened here too, 'Nes Gadol Hayah Po,' and will continue to happen with God's blessing. We are grateful for the Divine tradition and we give thanks for the blessings of liberty. Happy Chanukah."
