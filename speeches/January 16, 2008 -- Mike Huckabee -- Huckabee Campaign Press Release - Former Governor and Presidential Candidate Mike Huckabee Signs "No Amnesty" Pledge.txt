    Tigerville, SC â€“ While visiting North Greenville University today, former Arkansas Governor and Presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee became the first presidential candidate to sign a "no amnesty" pledge. He was joined at the event by Roy Beck, President of Americans for Better Immigration.
"I think it's important to be very clear," said Huckabee. "There should be no doubt about my Secure America Plan: our plan is not an amnesty or a sanctuary city plan but a proper plan for the rule of law. We will secure our borders and build the fence within 18 months."
Following is the pledge signed:
"I pledge to oppose amnesty or any other special path to citizenship for the millions of foreign nationals unlawfully present in the United States . As President, I will fully implement enforcement measures that, over time, will lead to the attrition of our illegal immigrant population. I also pledge to make security of our borders a top priority of my administration."
