    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New York's United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500.
"No one has been a greater friend of the working men and women of New York than Senator Clinton," said UFCW Local 1500 President Bruce Both. "Time and again she has supported our efforts to organize and improve wages, benefits and working conditions. She has fought for us as a Senator, and we know she would continue her advocacy for working families as President of the United States."
UFCW 1500 represents more than 22,000 members working in the grocery industry across the metropolitan New York area, and is the largest grocery workers union in the state.
"I am honored to receive the support of UFCW Local 1500," Clinton said. "America's working families have been invisible to this administration, and it's time they had a partner in the White House."
