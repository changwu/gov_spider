    Senior Obama Administration Officials to Attend Local Meetings
WASHINGTON—On Tuesday morning, senior citizens across the country will gather at a series of local meetings to participate via phone in a national tele-town hall meeting on the Affordable Care Act with President Barack Obama. Additionally, more than a dozen senior Obama Administration officials will join seniors at selected meetings to discuss the new health care law and answer questions. The President's tele-town hall meeting will be broadcast live on C-SPAN.
During the tele-town hall meeting, the President will take questions from seniors across the country. The President will also discuss the new health care law and efforts to combat senior scams and fraud in advance of the first mailing of the $250 rebate checks for seniors on Medicare who fall into the prescription drug coverage gap known as the "donut hole." An estimated 4 million seniors nationwide will receive rebate checks.
