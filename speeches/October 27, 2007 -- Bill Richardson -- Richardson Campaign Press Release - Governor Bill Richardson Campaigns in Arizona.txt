    Richardson launches Arizona Mi Familia chapters, meets with African-American leaders, holds meeting on energy and the environment
PHOENIX, AZ-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson campaigned in Arizona today, launching the inaugural chapters of Mi Familia con Bill Richardson in Phoenix and Tucson.
Mi Familia con Richardson, headed by National Director John Gomez, is a nationwide family-to-family grassroots mobilization network targeting the Latino community. The program focuses on the recruitment of family-based chapters to serve as message disseminators in their communities.
"More and more Latinos across the country are joining Mi Familia con Richardson," Governor Richardson said. "I am honored to be the first Latino to run for the Democratic nomination, and I am excited that our grassroots campaign is growing in Arizona."
Richardson met with African-American pastors and leaders in Phoenix.
"I was privileged to meet with these leaders in the African-American community," Richardson said. "They know my record on the issues that matter most. Together, I know that we can build a stronger, more just America."
Richardson also held a meeting on energy and the environment in Tucson.
"We need bold leadership to break our nation's addiction to foreign oil and build a clean energy economy," Richardson said. "I already have done so in my state. As Governor, I have turned New Mexico into the clean energy state. In addition, my energy plan has been called the most aggressive of any of the candidates' by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.
"Arizonans share my Western values. Like me, they know that we need to protect and conserve our land, water, and air."
