    Following Secretary Mineta's certification that Japan is undermining international whaling protections with its expanded whaling program, I am today directing that Japan be denied future access to fishing rights in U.S. waters and directing members of my Cabinet to consider additional steps we might take, including possible trade sanctions.
Strong international cooperation has allowed the recovery of many whale species once pushed to the brink of extinction. We must work to ensure that these protections are upheld. I hope that the steps we take today will encourage Japan to reverse its actions and respect the strong international consensus that has helped bring back some of Earth's most majestic creatures.
