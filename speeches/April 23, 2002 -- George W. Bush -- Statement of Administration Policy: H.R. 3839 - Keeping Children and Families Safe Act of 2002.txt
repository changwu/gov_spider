    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Hoekstra (R) MI and 14 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3839, which would reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Reauthorization of this important statute will help to provide the tools necessary to protect the well being of children and ensure the availability of treatment for children who need such services. However, the Administration has concerns with some of the bill's provisions, including federalism concerns with the eligibility provisions for State grants for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs, and looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.
