    I was so saddened to learn that Ted Sorensen passed away. I got to know Ted after he endorsed my campaign early on. He was just as I hoped he'd be, just as quick witted, just as serious of purpose, just as determined to keep America true to our highest ideals.
From his early days desegregating a Nebraska pool to his central role electing and advising President Kennedy, to his later years as an international lawyer and advocate, Ted lived an extraordinary life that made our country and our world more equal, more just, and more secure. Generations of Americans entered public service aspiring to follow in his footsteps.
Even as I mourn his loss, I know his legacy will live on in the words he wrote, the causes he advanced, and the hearts of anyone who is inspired by the promise of a new frontier. My heart goes out to his wife Gillian, his daughter Juliet, his sons Eric, Stephen, and Philip, and the entire Sorensen family.
