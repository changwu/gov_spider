Q. What did the doctors say?
The President. They're going to have a press conference at 9:30 a.m., I think.
Q. Will you cut back on your schedule at all?
The President. Not much. Kind of work back into it. But I think it's okay.
Q. What about jogging?
The President. Well, we can start again -- he said today if I want to, but I'm not sure I feel up to it yet.
Vice President
Q. What do you think about all the talk of the competence of Vice President Quayle that's been revived?
The President. Hey, he has my full support, always has, and he's doing a first-class job.
Hey, listen, it's great to be back.
