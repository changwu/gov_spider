    The President and President Hollande spoke today as part of their continuing consultations on the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons on August 21. The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime – and others who would consider using chemical weapons – that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world. The President informed President Hollande that after careful deliberation he has determined it is in the national security interest of the United States to take limited military action against the Syrian government to confront this atrocity, and informed him that he would call on the Congress to authorize the use of military force in Syria. President Obama thanked President Hollande for France's principled commitment to upholding the international norm against the use of chemical weapons and enforcing the consequences that give this norm meaning. France is a valued ally and friend of the United States and we will continue to consult closely on Syria in the coming days.
