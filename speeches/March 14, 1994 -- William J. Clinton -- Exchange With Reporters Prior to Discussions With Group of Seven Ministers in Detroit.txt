    Interest Rates
Q. Mr. President, do you think rising interest rates are hurting the U.S. economic recovery?
The President. I don't think we can say that for sure yet. They were bound to go up some after the fourth quarter growth figure came in; we had the highest growth rate in a decade. But I think that since there's no inflation in the economy, interest rates should not continue to go up. We'll see. If they moderate, tail off, then we'll be all right.
China
Q. Is the U.S., Mr. President, backing away from its human rights stand in terms of MFN for China?
The President. I was disappointed at the results of the meeting with the Secretary of State. And our policy is the same. We'll just have to wait and see what happens between now and June. I'll make a judgment at the appropriate time.
