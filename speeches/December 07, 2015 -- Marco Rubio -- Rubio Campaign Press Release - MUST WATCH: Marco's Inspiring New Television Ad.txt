Marco unveiled his latest television ad today, and it highlights the generational choice we will face in this election.

Here's what he has to say in the ad, drawn from the speech he used to announce his campaign:
This election is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be. And before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America. But we can't do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them.
The final verdict on our generation will be written by Americans who have not yet born. Let us make sure they record that we made the right choice. That in the early years of this century, faced with a rapidly changing and uncertain world, our generation rose to face the great challenges of our time.
And because we did, there was still one place in the world where who you come from does not determine how far you go. Because we did, our children and theirs lived in a New American Century.
Thank you, God bless you, God bless the United States.
I'm Marco Rubio and I approve of this message. 
Marco's ad will begin airing in Iowa today.
