    WASHINGTON, D.C.- Sen. Paul has reached a milestone in the Granite State as he received 300 endorsements from New Hampshire public officials, business leaders, and activists.
"Rand Paul is winning the all-important organizational primary here in New Hampshire. The fact that the has been able to secure 300 people to join his leadership team, especially in a 15-way presidential primary, is a testament to his message and his connection with our voters. The New Hampshire Primary is won by candidates that combine a platform that the Granite Staters want to be a part of and an organization that can carry the momentum to victory. We are fortunate to have both," says Mike Biundo, Rand Paul Campaign Senior Advisor.
