    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the National Women's Political Caucus
"We are so excited about Senator Clinton's candidacy," said Clare Giesen, NWPC's Executive Director. "Hillary Clinton possesses unparalleled experience, and will be ready to lead our country on day one. The National Women's Political Caucus is pleased to endorse the best candidate in the field, Hillary Clinton, and make history by electing the first woman president."
As part of its endorsement, NWPC will organize its members in 30 states, running a grassroots fundraising effort for Hillary, and holding events throughout the country.
NWPC was founded in 1971 to increase women's political participation and to win equal representation for women at all levels of government. NWPC endorses candidates regardless of partisan affiliation and has led the movement to increase women's numbers in federal government from in 1971 from 3 percent to 16 percent today.
"It's an honor to be supported by the National Women's Political Caucus," Clinton said. "For decades they have led the fight for women's equality in government and society."
