    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sponsor: Whitten (D, Mississippi; Hatfield (R), Oregon)
The President's senior advisors would recommend approval of the Continuing Resolution provided:

The spending levels proposed by the Committee are maintained and an acceptable reconciliation measure is enacted that brings the estimated deficit below the $154 billion "margin of error" that would trigger the need for a sequester under Gramm-Rudman-Eollings.
The significant policy matters that, in part, have given rise to veto threats on eight of the 13 individual appropriations measures axe resolved.
The resolution is kept free of extraneous funding and language provisions.

All aspects of the Continuing Resolution presented to the President for signature should be consistent with these criteria.
The Senate Committee version of the Continuing Resolution for FY 1987 is a marked improvement over the Resolution that passed the House. By contrast, the House version, which reduces defense spending, increases domestic spending, and restricts the President's authority to conduct essential national security programs, is altogether unacceptable.
To the maximum extent possible, the Resolution should be kept free of extraneous amendments. We very much hope that Congress will produce a Continuing Resolution the President can approve.
