    The President spoke this morning with UK Prime Minister David Cameron about the crises in Iraq and Ukraine, and the growing Ebola outbreak in West Africa. On Iraq, the two leaders agreed to provide additional, immediate humanitarian assistance, and to develop options that will secure the safety of the civilians on Mount Sinjar. They discussed efforts to counter the threat posed by ISIL against all Iraqis, and agreed on the need for Iraqi political leaders from all factions to put aside their differences and to form an inclusive government capable of pulling the country together. The President and Prime Minister also discussed the developing situation in Ukraine, and agreed that any Russian intervention in Ukraine, even under purported "humanitarian" auspices, without the formal, express consent and authorization of the Government of Ukraine is unacceptable, violates international law, and will provoke additional consequences. On Gaza, they condemned the resumption of rocket fire and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities leading to a sustainable cease-fire. President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron reiterated support for Israel's right to self-defense while emphasizing the need for all sides to minimize civilian casualties. Finally, regarding the growing Ebola outbreak, the two leaders welcomed the efforts of the World Health Organization, and vowed to increase the assistance provided by the U.S. and UK governments.
