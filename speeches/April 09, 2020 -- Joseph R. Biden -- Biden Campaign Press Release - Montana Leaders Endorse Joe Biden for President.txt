    Today, elected and community leaders from across Montana announced their endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"I worked closely with Joe throughout my time as a Senator and Ambassador to China during the Obama-Biden administration. I've seen his work ethic, his unique ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, and his fundamental empathy that has always guided his career in public service," said former Senator and Ambassador to China Max Baucus. "Those qualities will be essential to beating Donald Trump in November, as well as healing our country and moving us forward. It is more important than ever that we elect a leader who understands what is at stake and will fight - and deliver - for us. That's why Joe has my support and the support of so many Montanans from across our state."
