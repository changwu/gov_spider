    Yesterday, the United States lawfully took custody of Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-MarimiÂ and brought him to the United States where he faces charges for his alleged involvement in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. This action underscores the Biden Administration's unwavering commitment to enforcing the rule of law and holding accountable those who inflict harm on Americans in acts of terrorism. Through the unrelenting efforts of the Department of Justice, Department of State, and their partners, Abu Agila Mas'ud will now face justice.
