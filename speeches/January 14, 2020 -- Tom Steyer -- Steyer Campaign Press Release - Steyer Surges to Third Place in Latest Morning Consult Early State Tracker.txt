    Steyer Sees 5 Point Bump in One Week
(SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 14, 2020) — Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer continued his early state surge, rising to third place with 15% support in Morning Consult's latest early state tracker — a 5 point gain over last week's survey. The latest result, which is an average of poll responses in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, continues to show the strong momentum generated by last week's Fox News Poll, which showed Steyer placing in second place with 15% and third place with 12% in South Carolina and Nevada respectively.

"Tom's surging because his message is resonating: Washington is broken and that in order to fix it, we need to beat Trump and end corporate control of our government," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "The groundswell of support reflects the excitement we're seeing in the early states when Tom has a chance to meet face-to-face with people and share his vision of building shared prosperity for all."
Steyer is one of six candidates taking the DNC debate stage tonight in Iowa, where he will look to continue sharing his vision to tackle climate change and go toe-to-toe with Trump on the economy and exposing him for what he is: a fraud and a failure.
