    I wish to express my profound shock and abhorrence at the death of Corporal Nahshon Waxman as the result of his kidnaping by Hamas terrorists.
On behalf of the American people, Hillary and I would like to convey our deepest sympathy to the Waxman family and to the people of Israel at this dark moment. Nahshon Waxman was a son of Israel, but he was also a son of America.
Terrorists must know that these acts will not defeat the process that is bringing peace to Israel and her Arab enemies. In the face of such cowardly and evil actions, I know that it is hard to go forward. But we owe it to all those who have paid such a heavy price to persist and finally prevail in our pursuit of peace.
