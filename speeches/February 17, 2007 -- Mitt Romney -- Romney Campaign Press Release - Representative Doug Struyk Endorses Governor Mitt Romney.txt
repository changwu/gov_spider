Council Bluffs, IA - Today, Romney for President announced that State Representative Doug Struyk (R-Council Bluffs) will join the Iowa leadership team. Representative Struyk is an Assistant Leader of the House Republican Caucus and considered a rising star in the Legislature.
"We're excited to have Doug Struyk on our Iowa team. He brings valuable experience to our efforts in recruiting other legislators and organizing southwest Iowa for the Romney campaign," said Doug Gross, Governor Romney's Iowa Chairman.
"I've been very impressed with Governor Romney. He has the right background, the right skills, and the right message to be our strongest candidate, and a great President," said Representative Struyk.
As a small businessman himself, Representative Struyk emphasized Governor Romney's business background, his successful turnaround of the Olympics, and four years of fiscal discipline as Governor of Massachusetts as major factors in his decision to support Governor Romney.
"Voters are looking for someone who hasn't spent their whole career in Washington. We need someone from the outside, who understands how to prepare America to face the difficult road ahead â€“ from terrorism, to runaway government spending, to the challenges faced by families and schools," said Representative Struyk.
Representative Struyk joins State House Republican Leader Christopher Rants, former Speaker Brent Siegrist, former Iowa Republican Chairman Brian Kennedy and Doug Gross on Governor Romney's Iowa leadership team.
