    Memorandum for All Federal Government Employees 
Subject: Census 2000
We as a Nation are participating now in the largest peacetime mobilization in our history. I refer to Census 2000, the twenty-first census we have conducted in this country.
The decennial census is mandated by the U.S. Constitution, and responding to it is a civic responsibility for everyone living in this country. It is a truly universal activity that we can participate in, and full participation is important to the success and progress of every community.
The data collected will determine how more than $185 billion annually in public funds are shared fairly among the Nation's communities. The data provide the basis for planning and implementing thousands of laws and programs at every level of Government. The census numbers also are used to decide now many seats each State is allocated in the House of Representatives and to equitably draw voting districts at the State and local level.
Census 2000 is an event that offers us an opportunity to engage the spirit of civic participation that is so important to our representative democracy. The census is important to you and your family. It is important to your community. It is important to our Nation. It is in this spirit that I urge all Federal employees to complete their census forms.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
