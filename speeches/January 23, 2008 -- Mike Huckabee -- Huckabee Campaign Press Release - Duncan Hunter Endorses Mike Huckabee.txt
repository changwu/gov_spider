" Former Arkansas Governor and Republican Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee accepted the endorsement of Congressman Duncan Hunter, the former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee who withdrew from the Presidential race earlier this week.
Huckabee stated, "I'm honored to have Duncan Hunter's support. Over the past year, I have come to admire him on a personal and professional level. We share many of the same positions on the military and immigration. I look forward to having his support as our campaign continues to surge ahead to Super Tuesday and beyond."
"I got to know Governor Huckabee well on the campaign trail. Of the remaining candidates, I feel that he is strongly committed to strengthening national defense, constructing the border fence and meeting the challenge of China's emergence as a military superpower that is taking large portions of America's industrial base," said Congressman Hunter.
Hunter continued, "Mike Huckabee is a man of outstanding character and integrity. I saw that character over the last year of campaigning and was greatly impressed. The other Republican candidates have many strengths and I wish them all well. My personal choice is Mike Huckabee."
Huckabee called on Hunter's supporters as well as those of former Senator Fred Thompson who also withdrew from the race, to join his campaign. "As a true authentic conservative, I have a vision to bring hope, opportunity and prosperity to all Americans, and I welcome their support,"Huckabee said.
