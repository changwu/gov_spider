    I condemn the attack on Congressman Zeldin in the strongest terms. As I've said before, violence has absolutely no place in our society or our politics. I am especially grateful for the courage of those who immediately intervened and that he is unharmed and was able to continue his speech. I also want to thank the law enforcement officers who quickly took action and are investigating this attack that defies our fundamental democratic values.
