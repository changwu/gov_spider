    The Queen. It gives me great pleasure, Mr. President, to present you with the Churchill Award in recognition of the leadership you have shown to the world in recent months.
The President. Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Majesty, and Royal Highness Prince Philip, and Ambassador Loeb, and friends of what is indeed this special relationship. I have prepared here about a 45-minute speech -- [laughter] -- but if I gave it, we would all melt. [Laughter] And we want the visit of the Queen to be the best ever.
So, I will simply say that I am very, very grateful to you, Your Majesty, for taking the time to do this; to you, Ambassador Loeb, for your leadership and what you're doing in terms of scholarships. It is outstanding. It is wonderful.
And I'm old enough to remember, from World War II, Winston Churchill's leadership. He inspired the United Kingdom, but he inspired everybody in this country as well. And I think it's a marvelous symbol of the lasting, special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. And I am very proud and pleased and honored to receive this.
Thank you very, very much.
