    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Riegle (D) Michigan and 6 others)
If S. 320 is presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. S. 320 is identical to H.R. 4653, a 101st Congress bill which the President vetoed on November 16, 1990 â€” the President's Memorandum of Disapproval on H.R. 4653 is attached.
In vetoing H.R. 4653, the President stated that this legislation contained "serious and unacceptable flaws that would hamper our efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to ease restrictions on the legitimate sale of dual-use goods to acceptable users." Moreover, in his Memorandum of Disapproval, the President expressed his willingness to work with the 102nd Congress upon its return to "enact an appropriate extension of the Export Administration Act." Accordingly, S. 320 should be returned to the calendar so that the Administration and Congress can renew their efforts to develop a mutually acceptable bill.
