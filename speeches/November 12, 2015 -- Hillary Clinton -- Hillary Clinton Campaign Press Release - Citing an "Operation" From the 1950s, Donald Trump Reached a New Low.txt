At the last Republican debate, Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric and backward policies reached a new low: He gushed about President Eisenhower's deportation policy—one of the most shameful periods in our country's history.


  " [Eisenhower] moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border, they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south."Donald Trump

Trump was referring to something called (seriously) Operation Wetback. And yes, it was an actual government initiative under President Eisenhower, which deported hundreds of thousands Mexican migrants—and in some cases U.S. citizens of Mexican descent—deep into Mexico under abhorrent circumstances. Some were left for dead. Others were abused and humiliated.
It's outrageous that a frontrunner of the Republican Party would point to this operation as an example of sound policy. But what's even worse is how Trump suggested executing it:


  " [Y]ou're going to have a deportation force ..."Donald Trump

A deportation force, charged with locating, apprehending, and deporting 11 million people? There are a few words for that in Spanish: Inhumano. Barb?rico. Cruel.


  La idea de que vamos a deportar a 11 milliones de personas es absurda, inhumana y va en contra de nuestros valores. De ninguna manera Trump.— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 11, 2015
