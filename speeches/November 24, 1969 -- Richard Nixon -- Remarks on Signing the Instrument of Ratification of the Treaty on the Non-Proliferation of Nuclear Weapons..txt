    Ladies and gentlemen:
We have invited you here today to witness the signing of the Instrument of Ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to which the Senate gave its advice and consent on March 13th of this year.
This act of ratification completes a process which has spanned the administrations of three Presidents in which this treaty was negotiated and it is now being ratified.
It is our hope that after the ratification on the part of the United States that the necessary additional number of nations will ratify the treaty so that it will go into effect. In speaking of this treaty, we believe that this action today underlines the commitment of this Nation, not only for a policy of limiting armaments generally, but also to reduce those areas of conflict that potentially would result in a threat to the peace and security of the world.
And finally, I believe that this act of ratification clearly demonstrates that this Nation, through the administrations of all our Presidents in this century, is dedicated to the cause of peace, and we will continue to pursue that cause in every possible, effective way.
The Secretary of State, I think, will explain to you the final action with regard to the treaty and the ceremony which will be scheduled at that time. We have not set the date for it yet, but if you would explain it, Mr. Secretary.
