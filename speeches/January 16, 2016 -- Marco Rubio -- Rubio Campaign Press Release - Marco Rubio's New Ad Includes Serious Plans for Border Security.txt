Marco Rubio will secure our borders as President.
Check out this new ad about Marco's plan:

We all see what's happening.
Jeb Bush is desperate and spending millions on false attacks. Don't fall for it.
When I'm president, there will be no amnesty. I'll cancel Obama's unconstitutional executive orders; cut sanctuary city funding; and deport criminal aliens. We'll add 20,000 border agents; finish all 700 miles of border wall; and if we aren't 100 percent sure who you are and why you're coming to America, you're not getting in.

Marco understands that border security is national security.Marco's commitment to a strong border is why he is being backed by Kelly Terry-Willis, whose brother, Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, was killed by a Fast & Furious weapon during an operation on our border.
Marco is committed to keeping Americans safe.
