    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Rep. Doolittle (R) CA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2402. Specifically, the Administration opposes section 8, which would authorize the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority to use Federal project facilities for transporting additional water to the community it serves. The Administration believes that the provision is unnecessary because the Department of the Interior already has a memorandum of understanding with the Authority. In addition, the Administration is concerned that the provision could be construed to limit environmental review.
