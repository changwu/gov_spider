    I am disappointed at the decision by the Congress to override my veto of H.R. 7102, the Veterans Administration Health Care Amendments of 1980. I vetoed that bill because it would provide $80 million a year to VA physicians in unwarranted bonuses rather than to provide that amount on improved health care treatment for veterans themselves. I continue to believe that H.R. 7102 is an unsound piece of legislation.
H.R. 7102 provides excessive and inequitable bonuses to attract and retain physicians and dentists in VA's health care system. The VA currently enjoys an excellent recruitment and retention record, especially compared to other Federal medical systems. Further, this legislation would create an unfortunate disparity between the pay scale provided for VA physicians and that for the Armed Services and Public Health Service medical personnel. I am very concerned that, with the passage of this legislation into law, recruitment of needed physicians to nonVA health care systems will be adversely affected. The Defense Department was so concerned about this adverse effect on its health care system that it recommended a veto of H.R. 7102.
My administration is committed to providing quality health care for our Nation's veterans. As President, I have worked with the VA and the Congress to ensure that this care is the finest in the world. I would have preferred that Congress rewrite and improve this legislation by targeting money from the excessive bonuses to more concrete and tangible improvements in the veterans' health care system. I regret that this was not done.
