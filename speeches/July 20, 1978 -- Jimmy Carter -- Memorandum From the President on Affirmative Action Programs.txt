    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Since my Administration began, I have been strongly committed to a policy of affirmative action. It is through such programs that we can expect to remove the effects of discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for all Americans.
With your help, this Administration has been able to develop and implement meaningful affirmative action programs throughout the Federal government, and as a result minority employment has increased to its highest level in history.
The recent decision by the Supreme Court in Bakke enables us to continue those efforts without interruption. That historic decision indicates that properly tailored affirmative action plans, which provide minorities with increased access to federal programs and jobs and which are fair to all Americans, are consistent with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and with the Constitution.
I want to make certain that, in the aftermath of Bakke, you continue to develop, implement and enforce vigorously affirmative action programs. I also want to make certain that the Administration's strong commitment to equal opportunity and affirmative action is recognized and understood by all Americans.
JIMMY CARTER
