    Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Narcotics Control Certification for Panama
By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 481(h)(6) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the FAA) (22 U.S.C. 2291(h)(6)), and Sections 802(b)(4) and 803 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2492 (b)(4) and 2493), I hereby determine and certify that Panama has fully cooperated with the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own, to control narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering, as defined in Section 481(h)(2) of the FAA and Section 802(b) of the Trade Act, and that Panama does not have a government involved in the trade of illicit narcotics.
In making this determination, I have considered the factors set forth in Section 481(h)(3) of the FAA and Section 802(b)(2) of the Trade Act.
You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
George Bush
