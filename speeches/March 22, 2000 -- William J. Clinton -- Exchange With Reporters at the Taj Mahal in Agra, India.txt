    Visit to the Gandhi Memorial
Q. Mr. President, what were your thoughts when you were at the Gandhi Memorial?
The President. I was thinking about Gandhi's life. I was thinking about his going to South Africa, how he decided to come back here, how he completely gave his life over to what he believed, and how if all of us just had one fraction of that commitment, we could make peace in the world. That's what I was thinking.
Visit to Agra
Q. Mr. President, are you sort of sad that Agra is sort of a ghost town? Would you have liked to pump hands?
The President. Absolutely. I did see some people——
Q. Yes, but back there. They were peering——
The President. I know. I would have liked it if they were up front. I'd like that. I wanted to see them.
