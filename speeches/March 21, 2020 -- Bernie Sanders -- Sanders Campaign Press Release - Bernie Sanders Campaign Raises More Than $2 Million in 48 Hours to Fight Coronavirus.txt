    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Saturday announced that in the last 48 hours it raised more than $2 million for five charities on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak.
"What we've seen in the last two days is the definition of fighting for someone you don't know,'" Bernie 2020 Digital Fundraising Director Robin Curran said. "The people supporting this campaign have made more than 50,000 donations to help those most impacted by coronavirus because they understand that now more than ever it is important that we are in this together."
The Sanders campaign sent emails and text messages to raise funds for Meals on Wheels, No Kid Hungry, Restaurant Workers' Community Foundation COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund, One Fair Wage Emergency Fund, and the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
In the coming days, the campaign plans to raise money for more places doing critical work in the fight against coronavirus.
