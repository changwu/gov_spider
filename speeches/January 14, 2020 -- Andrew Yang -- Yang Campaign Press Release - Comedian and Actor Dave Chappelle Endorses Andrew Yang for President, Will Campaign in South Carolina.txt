    Today, comedian and actor Dave Chappelle officially endorsed Andrew Yang for president and announced he will perform two shows in South Carolina on January 29 and 30 to benefit the campaign.
"I'm Yang Gang!" said Chappelle. The two-time Emmy and Grammy award-winning comedian is best known for his sketch comedy series, Chappelle's Show. In October 2019, Chappelle was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, considered the country's highest honor in comedy.
"Dave is one of the most important voices in our country today and I'm thrilled he has thrown his support behind this campaign," said Andrew Yang. "He and I share similar concerns about the future and hopes for what it could be. We are also parents who see the world that we are leaving to our kids and believe they deserve better."
Chappelle's endorsement follows Andrew Yang's stunning $16.5 million haul in the final fundraising quarter of 2019, along with endorsements from actors Ken Jeong, Steven Yeun and Donald Glover.
