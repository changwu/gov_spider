    Today I am signing into law H.R. 13702, which provides the territory of American Samoa with a nonvoting Delegate to the United States House of Representatives. American Samoa became a member of the American political family through a voluntary act of cession by the chiefs of Tutuila and Manua at the turn of the century. Since that time, the people of American Samoa have demonstrated their attachment to this Nation by their patriotic service in the Armed Forces and have contributed greatly to our sports and cultural life.
American Samoa has made significant strides toward self-government in union with the United States. In 1960 American Samoans adopted their own locally drafted constitution, which was approved by the Secretary of the Interior. In 1969 American Samoan leaders began to take an active part in the territory's budgetary process. In 1970 the people of American Samoa elected a delegate at large to represent them in Washington, and in 1977 they elected their own Governor.
The United States should recognize, in view of this history, that American Samoa is a permanent part of American political life, deserving of representation in the United States Congress. The American Samoa Delegate legislation provides that recognition.
By signing this bill, I am signaling to the world that the United States remains committed to the well-being of American Samoa, to the development of democratic representation, and to our close brotherhood with the people of American Samoa.
