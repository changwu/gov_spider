    Against Tax Relief For Millions Of Working Michiganders
"We would have had a much bigger tax cut if it was not for John McCain. ... On economic policy, he has come down not only against reductions in taxes, but he has come down on the side of government intervention into a whole variety of different industries - when it seems to be a popular thing to be on that side - and I think that makes us a lot less competitive in a world that is becoming more competitive." - Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "A Conservative Case Against McCain," National Review, 1/14/08)
Sen. McCain Voted With Democrats Against The 2001 And 2003 Bush Tax Cuts:
In 2001, Sen. McCain Joined Michigan Democrats In Voting Against The $1.35 Trillion Bush Tax Cut. The bill lowered marginal rates, eliminated the marriage penalty, and doubled the child tax credit. (H.R. 1836, CQ Vote #170: Adopted 58-33: R 46-2; D 12-31; I 0-0, 5/26/01, McCain, Levin and Stabenow Voted Nay)
- The Detroit News Called Sens. Levin And Stabenow's Vote Against The Bush Tax Cuts "Disappointing." "The Senate adopted a $1.35 trillion tax cut bill, but neither of Michigan's U.S. senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, voted for the reduction. Twelve Democratic senators joined with all 50 GOP senators to adopt the tax cut. But Michigan's two Democratic senators were not among them -- even though some economists consider this state to be in the midst of a recession. The Senate version of the tax cut was a compromise with the administration, and supported by most moderate Democrats. It is disappointing that Sens. Levin and Stabenow weren't part of that group." (Editorial, "Levin And Stabenow: Where's Moderation," The Detroit News, 5/26/01)

In 2003, Sen. McCain Joined Michigan Democrats In Voting Against The $350 Billion Bush Tax Cut. The comprehensive bill lowered taxes by $350 billion over 11 years â€“ including increasing the child tax credit and eliminated the marriage penalty. (H.R. 2, CQ Vote #179: Passed 51-49: R 48-3; D 3-45; I 0-1, 5/15/03, McCain, Levin, and Stabenow Voted Nay; H.R. 2, CQ Vote #196: Adopted 50-50: R 48-3; D 2-46; I 0-1, 5/23/03, McCain, Levin, and Stabenow Voted Nay)

Michigan Publications Praised The Bush Tax Cuts That Sen. McCain Voted Against:
A Detroit News Editorial Called The Tax Cuts "A Very Good Start." "Just four months into his presidency, George W. Bush has accomplished the number one goal he set during the election campaign, providing substantive tax relief to American workers. The $1.35 trillion, ten year tax relief package -- $250 billion smaller than originally proposed -- is not everything we had hoped, - but it is more than could have been expected given the sharp divisions in Congress and the revulsion of the Democratic leadership to letting go of taxpayer dollars ...But if anything, this tax cut bill is overly cautious." (Editorial, "Tax Cuts: A Very Good Start," The Detroit News, 5/28/01)
The Detroit News Noted That The Bush Tax Cuts Benefited The Middle Class. "Opponents of tax relief claimed it would primarily benefit the wealthy. But a number of measures in the bill, including marriage penalty relief, increased child and education credits, an expansion of the 15 percent bracket and a new 10 percent bracket, will provide relief to lower- and middle-income earners that is larger proportionately than their share of the tax bill." (Editorial, "Tax Cuts: A Very Good Start," The Detroit News, 5/28/01)
- The Detroit News:"But Overall, Getting A Tax Cut That Accomplishes Most Of What Mr. Bush Set Out To Do Is Remarkable." (Editorial, "Tax Cuts: A Very Good Start," The Detroit News, 5/28/01)

Michigan's Automobile Industry Supported The Bush Tax Cuts:
Michigan's Top Three Auto Executives Supported Bush's Tax Cuts. "The chiefs of the Big Three U.S. automakers who met privately with President Bush on Monday reiterated their support for the president's proposal for at least $550 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. For about a half-hour, Bush talked to Ford Motor Co. chairman and chief executive Bill Ford Jr., General Motors Corp. chief executive Richard Wagoner, and Dieter Zetsche, the president and chief executive of the DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group." ("Big Three Execs Back Bush On Tax Cut Efforts," Grand Rapids Press, 4/29/03)
- "Bush Got The Support Of GM President And Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner, Ford Motor Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. And Chrysler Group President Dieter Zetsche For His Politically Challenged Tax-Cut Package." (Patricia Montemurri, "Jobs, Election Play Role In Visit," Detroit Free Press, 4/29/03)

General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner Supported The Bush Tax Cuts. "Acknowledging the incentives his company had thrived on are a diminishing return, General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner made his strongest pitch Friday for President George W. Bush's tax-cut plan that would eliminate taxes on dividends and accelerate income-tax rate cuts." (Jeffrey McCracken, "Wagoner Backs Tax Cuts," Detroit Free Press, 5/3/03)
- Wagoner Said The Bush Tax Cuts Met The Standard Of "Sound Economic Policy." "Earlier in the week, Wagoner and his counterparts at Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler Group met with Bush in Dearborn to voice their support for his tax plan. 'We think the package on the table or something like it is the answer. We vote for bigger versus smaller,' Wagoner said in a question-and-answer session after his speech. 'We need a plan that is consistent with sound economic policy. We think the Bush plan meets all those conditions.'" (Jeffrey McCracken, "Wagoner Backs Tax Cuts," Detroit Free Press, 5/3/03)

Ford Motor Chairman William Ford Supported The Bush Tax Cuts. "Ford lauded Bush for a presidential 'can-do spirit' and said the automakers 'support his package.'" (Patricia Montemurri, "Jobs, Election Play Role In Visit," Detroit Free Press, 4/29/03)
