    (SAN FRANCISCO, November 28, 2019) — Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer released the following statement in observance of Thanksgiving Day:
"On this day, let us all give thanks for the vast abundance of our country, our freedoms, our democracy, and each other. As we celebrate family and football and food, let us also remember the task ahead — to renew the great American spirit, to restore our passion for justice and to reclaim our fair and beautiful land. The next year will tell much about who we are and what it means to be an American. I am thankful to be a part of this brave and wonderful country that is brimming with wise and compassionate people."
