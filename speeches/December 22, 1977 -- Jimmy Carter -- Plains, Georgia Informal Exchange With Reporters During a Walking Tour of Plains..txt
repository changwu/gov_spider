THE PRESIDENT. Well, I've got all the notebooks on the different countries we are going to go to after Christmas. Then I am going to put the final touches on the Executive order on the intelligence community. I'll do that while I am here.
Q. Have you pretty much finished with the budget, your final decisions now?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I signed off on all the decisions yesterday morning. I'll have a brief session when I get back after Christmas just to look at the summary. And they are what they call "scrubbing" the budget now to make sure that the estimates are the best we can--
