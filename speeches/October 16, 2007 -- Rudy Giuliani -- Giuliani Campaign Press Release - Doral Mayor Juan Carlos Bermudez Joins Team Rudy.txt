    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of City of Doral Mayor Juan Carlos Bermudez. Bermudez joins a strong list of current and former elected officials and Republican Party leaders throughout Florida supporting Mayor Giuliani for President of the United States.
"Rudy remains the clear choice of Floridians. He knows the challenges we face at a local level and he has the vision to keep the country on a productive course. This mix of experience is unmatched as is his commitment to campaigning in Florida and winning the state's primary and general elections," said Mayor Bermudez.
Today's endorsement comes as the campaign prepares for the Mayor's 17th trip to Florida on Friday ahead of this weekend's Presidency IV Convention and Republican Debate.
