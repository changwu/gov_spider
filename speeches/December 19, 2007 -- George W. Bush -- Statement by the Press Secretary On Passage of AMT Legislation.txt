    We're pleased that today Congress was finally able to pass legislation -- without raising taxes -- that will protect 21 million additional Americans from being subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax this year. The AMT was never intended to hit these middle-class taxpayers, and the last thing they or the U.S. economy needs is a tax increase. Although passing the legislation this late in the year will make it difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to prepare the appropriate forms so that Americans can get their refunds on time, we know that the IRS will do everything possible to prevent delays.
