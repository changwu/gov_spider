    MANCHESTER, N.H. â€” Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (U.S. Rep, Hawaii) will be hitting the slopes in the Granite State next Tuesday the 28th. She is inviting supporters of the campaign to join her on Cranmore Mountain as she takes on the New Hampshire slopes. The campaign is expecting a large crew of adventurous supporters to join her and one lucky contestant will win an overnight trip to New Hampshire to meet and snowboard with Tulsi!
Recent polling out of New Hampshire shows Tulsi on a steady upwards climb, and the campaign's growing momentum is being propelled by the enthusiasm and growing support of New Hampshire residents who share Tulsi's vision of ushering in a future of peace, human dignity and true equality.
Tulsi has spent over 100 days (and counting) campaigning in the great state of New Hampshire since January 2019. She has connected with thousands of residents and has enjoyed discussing a wide range of issues with them at her nightly town halls.
The day of snowboarding fun will be finished with a town hall at the Main Lodge at 6pm.
