    I commend the Senate for confirming Michael Hayden as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency by a bipartisan majority. Winning the war on terror requires that America have the best intelligence possible, and his strong leadership will ensure that we do. General Hayden is a patriot and a dedicated public servant whose broad experience, dedication, and expertise make him the right person to lead the CIA at this critical time. I look forward to working with Ambassador Negroponte, General Hayden, and the other leaders of our intelligence community as we continue to address the challenges and threats we face in the 21st century. I congratulate General Hayden and his family on his confirmation and thank him for his continued service to our Nation.
