    DES MOINES, IA â€“ Iowans for Hillary today announced the names of 316 Iowans who have served our nation in the armed services and are supporting Hillary Clinton.
"In the Senate, Hillary fought to secure funding for veterans' hospitals, to reduce prescription drug prices for veterans, and provide additional support for disabled veterans," said Sgt. Major Dean Cox USA (Ret.). "I know that she will continue to stand up for us when she is in the White House."
"Hillary Clinton is the most qualified candidate for president and best able to restore our country's greatness," said Jon Tuttle, former Iowa State Commander of the American Legion. "I know that she will be a strong advocate for us veterans."
"I am honored to have the support of these veterans in our effort to change the course of this nation," said Senator Clinton. "With courage, the men and women of our armed services risk their lives under the banner of freedom. Once our soldiers have fulfilled their obligation to our country, our country must fulfill our obligation to them and their families."
Hillary is the first member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from New York, and has traveled overseas to witness firsthand the incredible courage of our troops. In the Senate, she has been a consistent leader in improving mental health services, access to medical care, general welfare and morale among our veterans.
The 316 veterans who have announced their support for Senator Clinton are:
