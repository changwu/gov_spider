    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2330, the "Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The Act abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion. It provides for several important programs with significant national benefits by:

fully funding the current participation rate for the key nutrition program for women, infants, and children;
supporting Department of Agriculture (USDA) food safety activities, including providing 7,600 meat and poultry inspectors; and
redirecting USDA research to provide new emphasis in key areas such as biotechnology, the development of new agricultural products, and improved protection against emerging exotic plant and animal diseases, as well as crop and animal pests.

A number of provisions contained in the bill purport to restrict executive branch execution of programs that are funded in the bill. Where such provisions contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chadha, their intent will be interpreted as advisory only.
I appreciate that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and my Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.
