MEDIA ADVISORY: Governor Scott Walker to Reveal Labor Policy in Nevada Town Hall on Monday
Following his speech at President Reagan's alma mater, Eureka College, where he discussed his Day One Plan, Governor Scott Walker will hold a town hall in Nevada on Monday. Walker will reveal his plans to address labor issues nationally, as he successfully did in Wisconsin.
As Walker said today, "On Monday, I will travel to Las Vegas to lay out our big, bold ideas to transfer power from the big government union bosses to the hard-working taxpayers. For example, on Day One, I will stop the government from taking money out of the paychecks of federal employees for political union dues."
"I've won those battles in Wisconsin and believe me, I won't back down from the battles in Washington."
The event will be open to the press. Details are as follows:
