    Today I am signing into law S. 1664, which establishes the Keweenaw National Historical Park. The Act also establishes the Keweenaw National Historical Park Advisory Commission, most of the Members of which are appointed by the Secretary of the Interior from among the nominees submitted by various State and local officials. Because most of the Members are effectively selected by various State and local government officials, and thus are not appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Article II, section 2, clause 2, I sign this bill on the understanding that the Commission will serve only in an advisory capacity and will not exercise executive authority.
