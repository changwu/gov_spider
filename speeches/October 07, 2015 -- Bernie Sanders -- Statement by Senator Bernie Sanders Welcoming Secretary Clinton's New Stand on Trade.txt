    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she now opposes a proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement:
"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a continuation of disastrous trade policies which have cost this country millions of decent-paying jobs and have led to a race to the bottom. As someone who voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China and who has helped lead the effort against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I am glad that Secretary Clinton has now come on board. I hope that, with her help, with the efforts of virtually every union in the country and with the opposition of many environmental groups, we can defeat this agreement which was largely written by Wall Street and corporate America."
