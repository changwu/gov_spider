    Mayor Rudy Giuliani continued to detail his 12 Commitments to the American People today, discussing his plan to lead America toward energy independence with Iowa Caucus goers.
Giuliani's plan focuses on diversifying the country's energy portfolio, securing, renewing and expanding America's energy infrastructure, encouraging efficiency and conservation, and tracking progress toward energy independence through EnergyStat.
"Every potential solution must be pursued â€” from nuclear power to increased energy exploration to more aggressive investment in alternative energy sources," said Rudy Giuliani. "I believe that America can achieve energy independence through a national strategy that emphasizes diversification, innovation and conservation."
Leading America toward energy independence is one of Rudy's Twelve Commitments to the American People, his bold vision aimed at moving America forward. He will continue to travel the country this summer to detail each of his Twelve Commitments. For more about the Twelve Commitments, please click here.
