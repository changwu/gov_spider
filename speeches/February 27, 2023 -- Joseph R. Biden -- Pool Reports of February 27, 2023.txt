In-town pool report #12
After being introduced by DuWayne Portis Jr. — a high school student from Chicago — VP Harris started her remarks at 5:22 pm. She spoke for seven minutes.
"I think he's going to get in," Harris joked after Portis revealed he plans to attend Howard University, Harris' alma mater. "You make us so proud, so proud. You'll get in."
"Black history is American history, living history, a breathing history," Harris said. "History that we create every day, a history that we teach and celebrate."
Harris said: "Let us all be clear. We will not a as a nation ever build a better future for America by trying to erase America's past."
Biden began speaking at 5:30 pm and said Dr. Jill Biden, who just got back from Kenya, hoped to be there. He spoke for 20 minutes.
Biden called his administration "the most diverse" in White House history and acknowledged Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries in attendance.
Biden also gave a shoutout to the "Divine Nine" presidents of the nation's historically Black fraternities and sororities in attendance.
"I may be a white boy but I'm not stupid. I learned a long time ago about the 'Divine Nine.'"
Biden touted $6 billion his administration has given HBCUs, federal contracts to minority-owned companies, a historic number of Black women appointed to the federal judiciary and the SCOTUS appointment of Kentanji Brown Jackson.
"We need Congress to come together to pass police reform legislation," Biden said, also renewing his call to ban assault weapons.
"In America, hate will not prevail," Biden said.
Bide said despite his victories for Black Americans, some aren't aware of the progress. He asked supporters to help promote the wins. (Check quotes here please.)
On student loans:
"I'm confident the legal authority is there" Biden said of forgiving student loan, which is before the Supreme Court.
Biden got his biggest applause at the end when he appears to be reciting a gospel song.
