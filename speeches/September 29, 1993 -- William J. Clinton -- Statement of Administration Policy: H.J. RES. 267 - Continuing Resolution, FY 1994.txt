    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsor: Natcher (D), Kentucky)
The Administration supports enactment of H.J. Res. 267, the Continuing Resolution, FY 1994, to provide for the operation of the government through October 21, 1993. H.J. Res. 267 contains a simple, temporary extension of normal government operations.
The Administration urges Congress to complete action on the remaining FY 1994 appropriations bills as quickly as possible so that a second Continuing Resolution for FY 1994 will not be necessary.
