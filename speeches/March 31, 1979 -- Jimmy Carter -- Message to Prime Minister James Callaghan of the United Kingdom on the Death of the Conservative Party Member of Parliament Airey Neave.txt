    I have been deeply shocked by the murder of Airey Neave. It is an outrage to civilized values. Such violence does not contribute in any way to the resolution of political problems and must be abhorred by all men of conscience everywhere. Please convey my deepest condolences and those of my fellow Americans to Mr. Neave's family and his parliamentary colleagues.
