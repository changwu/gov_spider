    Dear __________:
In response to section 1117 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 111-32, the "Act"), and in order to keep the Congress fully informed, I am providing the attached report related to Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the third report submitted under section 1117 of the Act and follows my September 2010 submission.
This report covers the period from July 1, 2010, through December 31, 2010, and provides an update on our assessment since that date. In December, my Administration completed a thorough review of our progress against our core policy objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan during 2010. The 2010 Afghanistan-Pakistan Annual Review also included an evaluation of the progress made during the period of this report, which marked the full deployment of the U.S. troop "surge" to Afghanistan that I announced in December 2009.
Sincerely,

Barack Obama
