  A Proclamation

Each year on the eleventh of October, the American people pay tribute to the memory of General Casimir Pulaski. In doing so they not only honor this great Polish champion of American freedom but also give recognition to the ties between our two nations, to the contributions of millions of other Polish-Americans to the birth and development of this country, and to the indivisibility of freedom everywhere.
By giving his life on the battlefield of our revolution, General Pulaski has provided inspiration to generations of his countrymen?in the United States and in Poland.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 11, 1980, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of General Pulaski by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.

JIMMY CARTER
