Travel Pool 3
POTUS emerged from church at 10:20 am local time wearing a blazer and a blue shirt with open collar and no tie, along with his aviators. He responded briefly to a shouted question about his New Year's resolutions. "Good year next year," he said. "Looking forward to it." He gave a thumbs up.
We are back rolling in the motorcade.
