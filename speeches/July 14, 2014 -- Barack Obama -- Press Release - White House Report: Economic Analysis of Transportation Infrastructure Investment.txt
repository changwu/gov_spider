    The White House today released a new report from the Council of Economic Advisers and National Economic Council on the long-term economic benefits of transportation investment and why conditions in the infrastructure sector are ripe for innovation, with new technologies and approaches promising significant gains in productivity, efficiency, and resilience.
The President has been clear that we need to improve our infrastructure and rebuild our roads and bridges in a smarter, more responsible way, while supporting millions of jobs. The President will continue to urge Congress to act to avoid a lapse in funding of the Highway Trust Fund, which will go insolvent as early as August â€“ putting numerous active projects at risk. This week Congress will consider a solution to avoid that scenario.
In addition to today's report, the White House released an interactive transportation map detailing the condition of and consequences for each state's roads and bridges as well as the jobs that would be put at risk, if Congress fails to act.
The report is attached, and the map can be found HERE.
