Remarks
Hartford, CT

Mitt Romney: "I was disappointed in listening to the President as he's saying ‘Republicans are waging a war on women.' The real war on women is being waged by the President's failed economic policies. ... These are just some statistics which show just how severe the war on women has been by virtue of the President's failed policies. The number of jobs ... this is an amazing statistic ... the percentage of jobs lost by women in the President's three years, three and a half years, 92.3 percent of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women. 92.3 percent! Now, the President says 'I didn't cause this recession.' That's true. He just made it worse. And made it last longer. And because it lasted longer, more and more women lost jobs such that in his three and a half years, 92.3 percent of the people who have lost jobs have been women. His failures have hurt women. More information: What president has the worst record on female labor force participation? Barack Obama. In history, we've gone back twenty years. The progress that was made of more women getting into the workforce has been stepped back twenty years by virtue of this president's policies. Under President Obama, 858,000 more women are out of work. 858,000 more women out of work under this president. And finally, the total female unemployment rate has gone from 7 percent when he took office in January 2009 to 8.1 percent in March of 2012. This president has failed America's women. And if I'm the next President of the United States, I will go to work to get American women good jobs, rising incomes, and growing businesses."
