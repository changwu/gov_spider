    "Drug trafficking, drug abuse, and organized crime are major threats to the well-being of our societies. To combat this threat, we must strengthen our respective law enforcement strategies and institutions, as well as develop closer and more trusting bilateral and multilateral cooperation."
President George W. Bush

The law enforcement relationship with Mexico is evolving into a solid partnership. The Fox Administration has launched a major effort to root out corruption, and has had several early successes.
Our two governments are committed to strengthening our law enforcement cooperation. Together, we are increasing "confidence and competence" through training and technical exchanges and improved information sharing. An example of an excellent collaborative effort was Operation Marquis, a joint operation that severely disrupted a major narcotics smuggling organization operating out of Nuevo Laredo in Mexico. As a result of Operation Marquis, law enforcement officials arrested over 80 suspects in major American cities and in Mexico.
The government of Mexico has also achieved notable success this year with the arrest of a former governor of the State of Quintana Roo, who was suspected of assisting in the transshipment of multi-ton shipments of cocaine from South America to the U.S. They also arrested Gilberto Garcia Mena, suspected leader of the Gulf Cartel, and Alcides Ramon Magana, a known drug kingpin.
