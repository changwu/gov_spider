    The United States of America (USA) and Singapore have agreed to start negotiations on a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA).
USA and Singapore are both firm supporters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and are committed to APEC's Bogor Goals of free and open trade and investment by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies.
The USA and Singapore reaffirm their strong commitment to the multilateral trading system and the launch of a New Round in 2001.
The FTA will be modeled after the US-Jordan FTA.
We have directed Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and Minister George Yeo to endeavor to conclude negotiations before the end of the year.
