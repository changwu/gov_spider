    The President. Welcome to the White House.
Children. Thank you.
The President. Yes. We're excited you are here. And we're excited you're here for a couple of reasons. One, we love to see the wonder in people's eyes when they get to see the majesty of the White House at this time of year. And I'm looking in your eyes, and I'm seeing wonder.
Secondly, I am glad you're here because I wanted to thank your moms and dads for serving the United States of America. We love being with our military families, because it gives us a chance to express the sincere and deep appreciation of all Americans for the sacrifices that families make. So I want to thank you for standing by your moms and dads and telling them you're proud of them and telling them you love them.
Thirdly, I'm going to ask you to do us a favor, and that is, when you e-mail mom or dad, just tell them you came by the White House—[laughter]—and the President and Laura, the First Lady, sent a special holiday greeting. So you'll be the messenger. So your job is to say, we respect your mom and dad, we admire your mom and dad, and we pray for your mom and dad. So would you do that for us?
Children. Yes.
The President. And fourthly, I'm glad to be here because I get to introduce my wife. [Laughter] It's a pretty neat thing, isn't it?
Children. Yes.
The President. Now, Laura tells me you've already seen Santa——
Children. Yes.
The President. ——had a few cookies——
Children. Yes.
The President. Yes? I'm surprised there's not more wiggling going on. [Laughter] At any rate, please welcome my dear wife, First Lady Laura Bush.
