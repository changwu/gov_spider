    I commend the House of Representatives for its leadership in passing an economic security package that will help workers and get our economy growing. This bipartisan plan will help ensure that workers have access to health care and unemployment benefits, that new jobs will be created, and that people will have more money in their pockets. For the sake of America's workers, I call on the Senate to act now on this plan, which can pass the Senate with a bipartisan majority if it is brought up for a vote. If this bipartisan bill gets to my desk, I will sign it.
