'I'm not ready to say we won,' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said recently. 'But we're no longer the crack capital of the world.' He attributed the change to a policy of zero tolerance for the open sale or use of drugs." ("Crack Fizzles In New York, Spurned By Youths," The [Baltimore] Sun, 9/26/99)

Now the vendors have formed a new cooperative and want to do the job themselves, ostensibly to save money." (Editorial, "First, Keep The Mob Out," New York Post, 10/2/05)

The proposal also would require owners to place partitions between the adult and non-adult portions of their businesses – helping to end "sham efforts" to sidestep the law, Giuliani said."

Giuliani's New Zoning Restrictions Drew Fire From X-Rated Businesses And NYCLU.

The complaints came from a parade of lawyers for X-rated businesses, the New York Civil Liberties Union … the proposed new restrictions, which are aimed at tightening the definition of adult establishments subject to the much-litigated 1995 zoning law. Eliminated would be the so-called 60-40 loophole that allowed scores of sex-related businesses to stay open by devoting at least 60% of their inventory or floor space to nonadult material or activities. The proposed new rules would empower the city Buildings Department commissioner to use customer activity and volume of sales, along with physical features, to impose the zoning restrictions."
