    We welcome the important decisions made last night by the European Union, which lay a critical foundation for a comprehensive solution to the euro zone crisis. We look forward to the full development and rapid implementation of their plan. We will continue to support the EU and our European allies in their efforts to address this crisis as we work together to sustain the global recovery and put our people back to work.
