    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Keller (R) Florida and 85 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 554. Food manufacturers, marketers, distributors, advertisers, and sellers should not be held liable for injury because a person's consumption of legal, unadulterated food is associated with the person's weight gain or obesity. By helping to curb the growing problem of frivolous lawsuits in the United States, H.R. 554 presents an important opportunity to prevent continued abuse of the legal system. At the same time, the legislation would carefully preserve the right of individuals to have their day in court to pursue non-frivolous civil liability actions and, in so doing, respects the traditional role of the States in the Federal system with regard to such actions. The legislation would also ensure that Federal regulatory agencies retain their authority to enforce food safety and consumer protection laws. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to improve certain provisions of the legislation as it moves forward.
