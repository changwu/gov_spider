    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Danforth (R) Missouri and 10 others)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 861, because it is unnecessary and counterproductive. S. 861 is unnecessary, because the administration agrees with the bill's overall motor carrier safety objectives and has initiated rulemaking in each of the areas addressed by the bill. It is counterproductive, because the schedule it would mandate for rulemaking related to truck braking systems provides far too little time for the development and review of field test data that the courts have found to be necessary for a validly-promulgated rule.
