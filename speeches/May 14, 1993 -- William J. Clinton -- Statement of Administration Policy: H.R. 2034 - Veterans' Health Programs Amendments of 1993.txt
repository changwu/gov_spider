    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/17/93)(House)(Rowland (D) GA and three others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2034, but will seek amendments in the Senate to make certain changes in the bill.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2034 would decrease receipts; therefore, H.R. 2034 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The bill does not contain provisions to offset the reduction in receipts. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, its deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 2034 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the Congressional session, as required by OBRA.
