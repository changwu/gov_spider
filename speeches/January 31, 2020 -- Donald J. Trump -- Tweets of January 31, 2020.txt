To keep America Safe, we have fully rebuilt the U.S. Military – it is now stronger, more powerful, and more lethal than ever before. Thanks to the courage of American Heroes, the ISIS Caliphate has been DESTROYED & its founder & leader – the animal known as al-Baghdadi – is DEAD! https://t.co/9LXDf6mJKfRetweets: 14333Favorites: 59367

Washington Dems have spent the last 3 years trying to overturn the last election – and we will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the NEXT ELECTION. Together, we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, & we are going to keep the White House! https://t.co/VshQceiwUARetweets: 16802Favorites: 62597

Americans across the political spectrum are disgusted by the Washington Democrats' Partisan Hoaxes, Witch Hunts, & Con Jobs. Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat Party in droves, & we are welcoming these voters to the Republican Party w/ wide open arms! https://t.co/UCdQXY3vPnRetweets: 20352Favorites: 75541

The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting "fairness", when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn't do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!Retweets: 42704Favorites: 180186
