    I applaud the Congress for passing S. 193, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act. I believe that Government has a responsibility to help strengthen families. This legislation will make television and radio more family friendly by allowing the FCC to impose stiffer fines on broadcasters who air obscene or indecent programming. Ilook forward to signing this important legislation into law.
