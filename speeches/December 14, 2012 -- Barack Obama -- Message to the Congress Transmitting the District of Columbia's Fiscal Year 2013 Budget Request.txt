    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to my constitutional authority and as contemplated by section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's fiscal year (FY) 2013 Budget and Financial Plan. This transmittal does not represent an endorsement of the contents of the D.C. government's requests.
The proposed FY 2013 Budget and Financial Plan reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For FY 2013, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $11.4 billion.
Barack Obama
