My dear Mr. Sprague :
I send you my cordial felicitations on your 75th birthday and all good wishes for the future.
Your contribution in the development of the electric motor, followed by the application of electricity to street railways and to elevators, links your name for all time with that distinguished group of inventors and engineers whose pioneer work made possible so many of our present utilities, comforts and conveniences.
It is fitting that the engineering and scientific world should show general recognition of your noteworthy services to the electric art, and it is with regret that I find I shall not be able to be present at your anniversary celebration. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Frank Julian Sprague, New York City]
