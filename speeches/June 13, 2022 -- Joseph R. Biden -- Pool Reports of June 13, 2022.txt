Marine One set down on the South Lawn at 12:42. The president exited at 12:44 and strode across the lawn, aviators in place, with nary a glance toward the pool. Questions were shouted asking him if he was running for a second term and if he was satisfied with the gun compromise. No acknowledgement. At 12:46, he entered the Oval Office.

In-town pool report 4 - gather for East Room
Gathering -- on schedule -- for the East Room event where the President will sign into law the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture Act.
The bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Grace Meng and in the Senate by Hawaii Sen.Mazie Hirono, passed the House on April 26 and the Senate on May 19. It sets up an eight-person commission to study the cost of the potential collection, whether it should be part of the Smithsonian and how best to engage Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the study.
The event is open press to those credentialed and will be streamed. So no pooling the remarks.

In town pool report 6 -- event
The president entered the East Room alongside the Vice President to the tune of Hail to the Chief at 1:23. The Vice president spoke first for three minutes, recalling her mother coming to this country at age 19 from India. She stressed that a museum must tell both the good and the bad of the story. That is also American history and we must teach it as it actually happened so we can learn from it, she said.
The president started speaking at 1:28. He said he was honored to sign the bill, calling it "long overdue." He stressed the diversity of the community and said "it's about time" for a museum. He also chided those "who seek to white wash our history" and said a museum has to include the full story. "The battle for the soul of America continues," he said.
At 1:36, he invited Speaker Pelosi and members of the caucus to the stage to join him for the actual signing. When finished, he chatted with the speaker for a while as God Bless America played. He departed the East Room at 1:42, ignoring shouted questions about guns.
