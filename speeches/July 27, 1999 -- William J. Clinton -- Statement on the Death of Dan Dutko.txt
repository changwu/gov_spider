    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the untimely death of our good friend Dan Dutko. Dan has been a friend, an ally, and an adviser for nearly three decades. He enriched our lives with his enthusiasm and served his country with distinction. He deeply believed in the cause of the Democratic Party and worked tirelessly to ensure that it would have the ability to communicate effectively with the voters. He was a devoted supporter of Israel and a champion of national service.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Deborah, and their two young children, Matthew and Jonathan.
