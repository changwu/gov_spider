    Early this morning in Bosnia, United States SFOR forces led a multinational effort to detain Stevan Todorovic, an indicted war criminal. The detention took place without incident, and Todorovic is now in the custody of the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
Todorovic, who served as chief of police for Bosanski Samac in 1992, is accused by the Tribunal of being personally responsible for some of the most heinous crimes that took place during the conflict in Bosnia.
This brings to 35 the number of indicted war criminals brought to justice. SFOR has assisted in well over half of these cases. This action by U.S. and other SFOR troops shows our continued determination to bring to justice those responsible for war crimes in Bosnia. This message should not be lost on those indicted war criminals still at large.
I wish to express my admiration for the SFOR troops who were involved in this operation and who continue to work daily to consolidate the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
