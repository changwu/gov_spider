    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246) (the "Act"), and as President of the United States, I hereby report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to terminate temporarily the suspensions under section 902(a)(3) of the Act with respect to the issuance of temporary munitions export licenses for exports to the People's Republic of China insofar as these restrictions pertain to firearms and related items for use by U.S. and non-U.S. athletes competing in shooting events, and military gyroscopes that are embedded in mobile high definition television camera systems for use by U.S. filming crews, at the Beijing Olympics. Licensing requirements remain in place for these exports and require review and approval on a case-by-case basis by the United States Government. The equipment will be returned to the United States following the end of the games.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
