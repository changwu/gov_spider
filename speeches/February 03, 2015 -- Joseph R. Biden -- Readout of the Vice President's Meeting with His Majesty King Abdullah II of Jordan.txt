    Today, the Vice President hosted the King of Jordan for a meeting at the Naval Observatory. The Vice President offered his condolences to the family of First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh and all the people of Jordan. He condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the brutality and violence that ISIL has consistently shown to its captives and to the people of Iraq and Syria. The Vice President called for the release of all those held prisoner by ISIL. The Vice President also reinforced America's ironclad support for Jordan and his appreciation of Jordan's contributions to the coalition against ISIL. As the Vice President made clear, this horrific video exposes ISIL's true nature for all to see. It only reinforces our resolve to defeat ISIL together.
