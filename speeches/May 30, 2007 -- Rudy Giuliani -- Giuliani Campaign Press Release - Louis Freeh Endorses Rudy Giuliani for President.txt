    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that former Director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, has put his support behind Rudy Giuliani for President of the United States. Freeh will serve as Senior Homeland Security Advisor and Chair of the Mayor's campaign in Delaware.
"Rudy Giuliani's optimistic leadership is responsible for making the city of New York what it is today â€”one of the safest large cities in the country and a place where the world feels safe to visit. Through Rudy's use of innovative crime fighting programs like CompStat, he demonstrated that with determination and strength, solutions can be crafted to seemingly intractable problems," Freeh said. "I have known and admired Rudy for his law enforcement leadership and innovation for over twenty-five years. His devotion to public safety and the rule of law, plus real life knowledge about crime reduction turned one of the country's most dangerous cities into the model for law and order."
"No one knows better than Louie Freeh what it takes to fight crime. I admire Louis Freeh for his dedication to justice and public service and I'm honored to have him as an advisor to the campaign," Mayor Giuliani said.
