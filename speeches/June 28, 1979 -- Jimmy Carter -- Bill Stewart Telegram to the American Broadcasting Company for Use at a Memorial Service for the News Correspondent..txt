    The murder of ABC correspondent Bill Stewart in Nicaragua is a tragedy for his family, his friends, and for freedom-loving people everywhere.
Bill Stewart was a dedicated and courageous journalist. At the time of his death, he was attempting to perform the highest duty of the American press: to inform the public on the important issues of the day.
As nations become increasingly interdependent, our ability to solve our common problems, our very ability to survive and our hope of peace depends to a large degree upon our knowledge of conditions and events around the world. It is important that our journalists, as well as those of other countries, be allowed to cover world events without undue restraint.
When journalists are intimidated, the search for truth is intimidated.
On behalf of all Americans, Rosalynn and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Bill Stewart's wife, his family and friends.
