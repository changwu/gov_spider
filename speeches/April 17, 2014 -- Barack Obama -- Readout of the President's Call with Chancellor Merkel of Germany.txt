    The President and Chancellor Merkel of Germany spoke today regarding their deep concern about the situation in eastern Ukraine. The President commended the government of Ukraine's approach to today's discussions in Geneva, where it put forward constructive proposals to expand local governance and ensure the rights of all Ukrainians are protected. The leaders stressed that Russia needs to take immediate, concrete actions to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine, including by using its influence over the irregular forces in eastern Ukraine to get them to lay down their arms and leave the buildings they have seized. The President and the Chancellor agreed that the United States and Europe are prepared to take further measures if this de-escalation does not occur in short order. The leaders also stressed their support for Ukraine's May 25 presidential elections.
