    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senator Mathias (R) Maryland)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 998 because the threat of imposing economic sanctions against South Africa within two years is inconsistent with our approach to supporting constructive internal reform and regional security. These measures are unlikely to produce the kind of results we all seek. The Administration believes that the best way to achieve peaceful change in South Africa is to use the means and resources available to the United States, including those of the private sector, in a positive rather than negative manner.
