In town pool report #2 - M1 departure. Comments on Speaker election
Hello, stepping in as you're in town pooler today.
The president exited the residence at 9:57
He took questions on the election of the Speaker of the House, a run for 2024 and Pope Benedict.
About the Speaker of the House election he said "That's not my problem" and added that it is "embarrassing" that the process is taking so long. He added that "the rest of the world is looking" and that he himself is focused on "getting things done".
More quotes tk.
Please check against transcript and video as your pooler was not able to get clean audio for all the remarks.
He boarded at 10:01.
M1 was wheels up at 10:04.

In-town pool report #3 - More quotes
Herewith more detailed quotes from the president on the Speaker fight
"It's a little embarrassing it's taking so long, and the way they are dealing with one another"
"The rest of the world is looking"
"What I am focused on is getting things done"
Speaking about what it means internationally he said "This is not a good look, this is not a good thing" for the country.
"I hope they get their act together"
On Pope Benedict
The president said he "admired him"
POTUS also said that he "inquired" about going to the funeral.
Stressing again: please check against transcript, as it was difficult to hear with M1 in the background and your pooler was not always near the president when he was speaking.
