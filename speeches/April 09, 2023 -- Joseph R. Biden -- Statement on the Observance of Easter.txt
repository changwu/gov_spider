    Jill and I join Christians around the world in celebrating Easter Sunday, a day of hope and joy, renewal and rebirth. It marks the end of Lent, a period of sacrifice and contemplation. And it commemorates Christ's Resurrection, a powerful reminder of God's love and the promise of redemption for us all.
During Lent and especially on Good Friday, we held in our hearts all those who are suffering from threats of violence and persecution, grief and isolation, and illness, poverty, and other hardships.
Today we hold close the Easter message that nothing—not even death—can match the power of faith, hope, and love. And we remember Jesus' sacrifice and recommit ourselves to love God with all our hearts and to love our neighbors as ourselves, embracing His call to treat one another with compassion.
To all those gathering in churches and homes around the world today, happy Easter, and may God bless and keep you.
