    LAS VEGAS--The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the Sheet Metal, Air Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART). SMART is a newly formed union, merging the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association and the United Transportation Union, with a combined membership of more than 230,000.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring about the change SMART members and America's working families need," said Michael J. Sullivan, president of the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association and the future president of SMART. "We want new leadership and new thinking both at home and abroad, and she will bring to this high office the intelligence and common sense necessary to guide our nation."
After the endorsement event in Las Vegas, hundreds of SMART members fanned out in neighborhoods across the city to knock on doors for Hillary.
"Hillary Clinton understands our issues. She knows the importance of sound policies and programs to address the energy crisis, fair trade, quality and affordable health care, funding college and technical education and training, as well as protecting retirement security," said Sullivan.
"I am honored to have the support of the Sheet Metal, Air Rail, and Transportation Workers," Clinton said. "We will stand together to rebuild the middle class and make sure that America's working families are no longer invisible to the President of the United States."
Clinton has received strong support from major unions representing more than 3.6 million working families nationwide. Her endorsements include the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; International Associations of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Transportation Communications Union; National Association of Letter Carriers; International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers; American Federation of Teachers; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
