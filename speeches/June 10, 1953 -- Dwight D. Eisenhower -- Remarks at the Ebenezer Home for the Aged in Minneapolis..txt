    I AM GRATEFUL, both to the Republican State Central Committee and to the members of the Ebenezer Home, for allowing me to stop here and say a brief word of greeting to so many fellow Americans.
I have gone through this town today, and I am very proud and very humble in the realization that I have received a welcome far beyond my deserts.
I can only say here, in the hope that you will carry it to all of your neighbors, that I am grateful for every smile I have seen, and I say thanks to everybody who has yelled "Hi, Ike," or "Hello, there."
I have been in many countries of the world. Some of them have chosen me, as a representative of our people, to receive their very highest awards to bring home to you. But no honor I have ever received has yet equaled in my own heart, in my own mind, just that warm feeling you get from a whole crowd of my fellow citizens looking at me as if to say, "Well, we are sort of glad you came around."
I want to say to you, I am sort of glad I came around to see you.
