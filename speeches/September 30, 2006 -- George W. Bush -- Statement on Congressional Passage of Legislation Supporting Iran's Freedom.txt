    My administration is working on many fronts to address the challenges posed by the Iranian regime's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorism, efforts to destabilize the Middle East, and repression of the fundamental human rights of the citizens of Iran. We are engaged in intense diplomacy alongside our allies and have also undertaken financial measures to counter the actions of the Iranian regime.
I applaud Congress for demonstrating its bipartisan commitment to confronting the Iranian regime's repressive and destabilizing activities by passing the Iran Freedom Support Act. This legislation will codify U.S. sanctions on Iran while providing my administration with flexibility to tailor those sanctions in appropriate circumstances and impose sanctions upon entities that aid the Iranian regime's development of nuclear weapons.
I applaud the efforts of Chairman Richard Shelby, Ranking Member Paul Sarbanes, Rick Santorum, and Bill Nelson in the Senate and Chairman Henry Hyde, Ranking Member Tom Lantos, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Gary Ackerman in the House. I look forward to signing this bill into law, which will facilitate America's support for the Iranian people in their efforts to build a just, free, and peaceful society.
