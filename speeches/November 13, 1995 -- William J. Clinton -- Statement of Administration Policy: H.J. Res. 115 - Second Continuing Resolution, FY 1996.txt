    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Sponsor: Livingston (R), Louisiana Hatfield (R), Oregon)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.J. Rea. 115, the Second Continuing Resolution, FY 1996.
If H.J. Res. 115 were presented to the President as it passed the House on November 10, he would veto it. The Administration would support a simple extension of the current continuing resolution to give congress time to finish its work.
