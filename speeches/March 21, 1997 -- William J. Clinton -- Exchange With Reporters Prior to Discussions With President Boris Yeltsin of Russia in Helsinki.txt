    Russia and NATO
Q. President Yeltsin, do you consider NATO a threat to Russia, or are you convinced otherwise by now?
President Yeltsin. Well, I'm not convinced otherwise.
President Clinton. We'll have a press conference later, guys.
Q. You guys always give us a surprise when you meet, Mr. President. Do you expect any surprises today?
President Yeltsin. Perhaps through the course of the discussions we may have some surprises. We won't have any surprises at the end of the discussions.
