    Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Council of Representatives Speaker Salim al-Jabouri to discuss the selection of Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi and the ongoing government formation process. Vice President Biden commended Speaker Jabouri for his efforts in leading the new Iraqi parliament, whose 328 members represent the will of the nearly 14 million citizens who risked their lives to vote in national elections on April 30. Speaker Jabouri expressed his intent to move quickly with Dr. Abadi to form an inclusive cabinet capable of confronting Iraq's challenges, particularly the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The Vice President also emphasized President Obama's interest in working closely with Iraq's next government to develop strategies to defeat ISIL and ensure that it can no longer pose a threat to the Iraqi people.
