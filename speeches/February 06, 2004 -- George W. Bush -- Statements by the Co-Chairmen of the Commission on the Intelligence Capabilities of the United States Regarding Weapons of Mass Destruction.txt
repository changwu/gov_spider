    I have long believed that accurate and timely intelligence is key to our nation's security. The integrity of the collection and analysis of that information is essential. I look forward to working with Judge Silberman and the Commission to conduct an independent review and assessment of the effectiveness of those efforts.
Statement by Judge Laurence Silberman
I am honored to serve as co-chairman of this important Commission with a distinguished public servant, Governor Robb. The country and the President must maintain confidence in the Intelligence Community, and I will do all I can to serve that goal.
