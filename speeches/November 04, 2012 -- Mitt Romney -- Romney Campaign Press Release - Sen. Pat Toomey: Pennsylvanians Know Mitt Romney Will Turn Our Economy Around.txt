    Boston, MA â€” Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"The choice in this election is clear. Under President Obama, we will have four more years like the last four years, with higher taxes, stagnant unemployment and less take-home pay. When Mitt Romney is president, we will have pro-growth policies that reform our tax code, foster upward mobility, and deliver more jobs and more take-home pay. Pennsylvanians know that Mitt Romney has the leadership to turn our economy around, and they are going to deliver a win for the Romney-Ryan team on Tuesday."
