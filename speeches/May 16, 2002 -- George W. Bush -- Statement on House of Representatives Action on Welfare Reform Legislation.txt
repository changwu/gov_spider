    Today the House passed welfare reform legislation that will help millions of Americans realize a life of hope, dignity, and independence. This compassionate approach builds upon our past successes by moving more Americans from welfare to work, encouraging strong families and healthy marriages, and freeing States to innovate as they help people find the independence of a job. I commend the House for moving quickly and now urge the Senate to act on behalf of those who seek a better life.
