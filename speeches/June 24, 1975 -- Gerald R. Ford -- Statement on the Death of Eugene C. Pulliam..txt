    MRS. FORD and I are deeply grieved at the death of Gene Pulliam. His dedication and integrity made him a giant in the publishing industry for some 60 years. Betty and I send our deepest sympathy to his wife, Nina, his family, and friends. A great publisher and a great American, Gene Pulliam will be sorely missed.
