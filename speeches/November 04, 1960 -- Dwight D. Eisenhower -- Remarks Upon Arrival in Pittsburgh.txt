    My friends:
Thank you very much for this welcome, but I must get this record straight. My name is not Dick Groat, it is not Mazeroski--I am not Vern Law.
But I am most sincerely grateful to you for the warmth of this welcome.
I have just come from Cleveland where I saw another great crowd, and I saw the same signs "Vote for Nixon and Lodge."
And that is what I am going to do.
Thank you very much.
