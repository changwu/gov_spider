    Camp Kamala will allow the campaign to harness Iowa's organizing power ahead of the summer
Today, Kamala Harris announced that her campaign in Iowa is hosting student and youth organizing trainings on college and community college campuses across the state. The training programs, called Camp Kamala, will happen from April 16 - 18 at the University of Iowa, Drake, Iowa State, Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC), and the University of Northern Iowa. Students and young people will apply to participate in the program. This effort will allow the Harris campaign to harness the organizing power of students before they head home for the summer.
"Students and young people in Iowa are going to play a critical organizing role in the caucuses. I hope you'll join our team in April to learn more about the campaign and how to get involved," Kamala Harris said.

"Our campaign is working to organize young Iowans who are the future of the country," Will Dubbs, Kamala Harris Iowa State Director, said. "I am proud that we will be able to utilize the excitement around Kamala's campaign heading into the critical summer months."
Students and young Iowans will be invited to hear directly from the campaign about Team Kamala's caucus organizing strategy and learn how to get involved. They will also be trained on the caucus process and sent home with the tools to organize their fellow students and communities over the summer and into the fall.
Students and young Iowans are encouraged to apply to take part in the program here: https://action.kamalaharris.org/signup/camp-kamala/. The application closes on April 13 and participants will be accepted on a rolling basis.
The Harris campaign in Iowa is organizing in every corner of the state. Earlier this month the campaign announced it has supporters in all 99 counties of Iowa.
