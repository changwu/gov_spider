    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 360, making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 1992.
Providing for the operation of the Government through Continuing Resolutions is an undesirable practice. However, a Second Continuing Resolution for FY 1992 is necessary at this time in order to keep certain activities of the Government functioning while the Congress completes the appropriations process.
I commend the Congress for presenting me with a simple, straightforward extension of funding that is not burdened with unrelated provisions. I also urge the Congress to complete the ordinary appropriations process by November 14, which is the date this Resolution expires except for activities covered by the Foreign Operations appropriations bill.
