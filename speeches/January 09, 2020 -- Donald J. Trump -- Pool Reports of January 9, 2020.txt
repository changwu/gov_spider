Then there's an intelligence briefing at 2 p.m. before he leaves from the South Lawn at 4:15 p.m. for a rally in Toledo, Ohio.

Pool report 3: Event details 
Here's some background from the press office and a list of expected attendees.
Today, President Donald J. Trump will deliver remarks on the latest step his Administration is taking to reverse burdensome regulations. The Council of Environmental Quality's (CEQ) proposal will modernize the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations to promote more efficient, effective, and timely NEPA reviews of infrastructure projects that will increase our Nation's economic competitiveness and improve the quality of life of our citizens. This action is great news for families frustrated with traffic, farmers wanting to help feed the world, and small business owners interested in reducing transportation costs to better serve their customers.
NEPA regulations have not been comprehensively updated in over 40 years. President Trump knows time is money: Today's action will establish time limits of 2 years for completion of environmental impact statements and one year for completion of environmental assessments.

Pool report 4: Environment event remarks 
POTUS entered at 11:19 and spoke until 11:28. The event is ongoing with other administration officials and supporters speaking, but wanted to share some remarks. Stay tuned for Q&A.
Trump said projects are "tied up and bogged down by an outrageously slow and burdensome federal approval process."
His goal is "fixing this regulatory nightmare"
"We're going to have very strong regulation, but it's going to go very quickly."
"America is a nation of builders." But it takes too long to get a permit, and that's "big government at its absolute worst."
Trump said the policy will cut the timeline for obtaining permits and force federal agencies to work more closely together to speed the process.
"We're maintains America's world-class standards of environmental protection."
Trump said he won't stop until "gleaming new infrastructure has made America the envy of the world again."
Now we're like a "third world country."

Pool report 5: Trump Q&A 
Event ongoing, but sending because of Trump remarks on Ukraine plane at end of this report
The first question was about phase 2 of China trade deal and whether he would go to Beijing.
Trump said phase one is "a tremendous percentage" of the overall deal. It's good for farmers and bankers, he said.
Phase 2 "will take a little bit of time," and it may wait until after the election.
Trump emphasized that his trade policies are good for farmers. "The farmers did pretty well, and now they're doing great."
Second question on whether there should be witnesses for impeachment
Trump said he would leave it up to the Senate.
"I'd like to hear the whistleblower, I'd like to hear Shifty Schiff." He also wants testimony from Hunter and Joe Biden.
"The whole thing is a hoax."
Trump is wondering about why a second whistleblower didn't come forward. "Maybe we know who the second whistleblower was."
"The ones who are guilty are the Democrats."
Third question was on war powers
Trump said senators told him the Iran briefing was the "greatest presentation they ever had." It would be hard to provide any more details to Congress at large because its classified information, he said.
"I get along great with Mike Lee, I've never seen him like that."
Trump said killing Sulemani was the right thing.
"We caught a total monster, and we took him out."
"They were looking to blow up our embassy."
Trump says he doesn't want to go to Congress for more authorization because "you have to make split second decisions."
He accused Pelosi of "defending a monster" by opposing killing Sulemani. "I think that's a very bad thing for this country."
Next question on JCPOA
Trump complained about Obama administration providing money to Iran. "That money was used for terror... That's when it became really bad."
"Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. They understand that."
Trump said Iran probably wants to negotiate with a weak Democrat and called Warren "Pocahontas" and some people around him chuckled.
Next question on new Iran sanctions.
Trump said they've already been put in place, and said details will be provided.
What about the Ukrainian plane that went done in Iran?
"I have my suspicions. I don't want to say that."
"It's a tragic thing when I see that. Someone could have made a mistake on the other side... Not our system. It has nothing to do with us."
The plane was flying in a "rough neighborhood."
"Something very terrible happened."



January 9, 202012:09

Pool report 6: More questions, event over 
The event ended at 12:06.
Trump was asked about what he said was a plot by Sulemani to blow up the US embassy in Baghdad.
"I think it was obvious." Trump complained about how Benghazi was handled and said Baghdad was "the anti Benghazi."
The militias could have taken hostages or killed people at the embassy if he didn't act quickly.
As far as Sulemani's plans, "he had more than that particular embassy in mind."
Trump was asked about potential Bolton testimony
He didn't say he would block it but expressed concerns.
"We have to protect presidential privilege for me but also for future presidents."
What about request for NATO's help in Middle East?
He said he had a name thought of a name for NATO's participation because he's good at naming things.
"NATOME"
"If you add the two words â€˜Middle East' at the end of it." Trump said it sounds "beautiful," and it's "NATO plus me."
Trump was asked whether climate change is a hoax.
"Nothing's a hoax about that. It's a very serious subject." He said he has a book about it that he's going to read.
"I'm a big believer in that word, the environment." But he also wants jobs.
How much of his own money will he spend on reelection?
"I have not thought about it," he said. Trump said they're raising more money because of the "impeachment hoax."
He said he didn't get enough credit for using his own money for 2016 campaign or donating his presidential salary.

Pool report 10: Flood mitigation in N.C. 
POTUS is on his way back from his Ohio rally, and the press office passes along this announcement.
Today, President Donald J. Trump called Mayor Bobbie Jones (Princeville, NC) to notify the Mayor that the Army Corps of Engineers will advance a flood mitigation project with an estimated cost of $39.6 million to improve levee and drainage systems in the community. The City of Princeville has a powerful heritage as it was established by freed slaves after the Civil War and is believed to be the oldest city in the United States incorporated by African Americans. Princeville has long battled flooding over the decades and President Trump previously spoke with Mayor Jones ahead of Tropical Storm Florence and White House staff have continued discussions about longstanding flood mitigation needs in the community. Mayor Jones also attended the White House Opportunity Zone Summit in April 2019 in which President Trump discussed transforming America's communities with bipartisan community leaders from across the Nation.

Travel pool report #5 
Toledo Ohio
From Hogan Gidley:
"The President has the right and duty to protect this nation and our citizens from terrorism. That's what he continues to do, and the world is safer for it.
"This House resolution tries to undermine the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevent terrorist activity by Iran and its proxies, and attempts to hinder the President's authority to protect America and our interests in the region from the continued threats. These Congressional actions are completely misguided. In fact, this ridiculous resolution is just another political move because, under well-established Supreme Court precedent, it's non-binding and lacks the force of law.
"President Trump's decision to strike Qassem Soleimani, the world's leading terrorist, was the right course of action and authorized under his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive as well as the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force."

As the motorcade drove in, your pool caught a glimpse of what appeared to be hundreds of people protesting POTUS and then hundreds more â€“ perhaps thousands â€“ in an overflow area with a large video screen showing the rally.
