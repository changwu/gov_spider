    (Denver, CO) - Former Mayor of Denver Wellington Webb responded to the Democratic Presidential Debate in South Carolina tonight:
"In tonight's debate in South Carolina, Hillary showed she's willing to stand up for what matters most in this campaign - making a difference in the lives of Coloradans," said Webb. "She laid out concrete solutions to our toughest challenges and made clear that it takes more than a vision to make change, you have to be able to deliver it.
"When Senator Obama claimed that he would provide universal health care, Hillary made clear that his optional plan would leave at least 15 million uninsured. She reminded Americans that she's been fighting for quality, affordable health care for every American throughout her career, and has never given up. Her plan covers every American. Period.
"As Hillary said, 'I am not running for President to put a band-aid on our problems.' Tonight, Hillary made clear that she will continue giving a voice to those who are struggling to make ends meet in an economy leaving more and more Americans behind."
