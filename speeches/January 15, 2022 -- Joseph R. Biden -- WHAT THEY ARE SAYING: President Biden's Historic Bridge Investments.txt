    Yesterday, President Biden announced details on how his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes the largest investment in America's bridges since the creation of interstate highways.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) outlined $27 billion in funding that all 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and Tribal governments can use over the next five years to replace, repair, and rehabilitate an estimated 15,000 bridges nationwide. These investments will not only create good-paying jobs fixing bridges, but improve their safety, make them more resilient to climate change, and connect entire towns and regions to economic opportunities. And, improving the nation's bridges will rebuild supply chains at home and strengthen domestic manufacturing so we make and move more goods in America.
Members of Congress who helped deliver the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as Governors, Mayor, local officials, advocacy organizations – lauded the investments in bridges and highlighted how they will help communities across the country.
See below for what they're saying:
Members of Congress
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: "This new funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make bridges throughout the Golden State safer and stronger is further proof that Democrats Deliver! Thanks to the leadership of President Biden and House Democrats, communities across California will soon see the direct impact of this investment – the largest bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system.? With this $4.2 billion in new funding over the next five years, we can repair, replace and rehabilitate the more than 1,500 bridges in our state that are currently in poor condition – while creating good-paying union jobs for Californians.? In doing so, we will make commutes to work or to school shorter and safer, help small businesses get their goods to market and ensure our bridges can withstand increasingly destructive climate disasters.? And, we will ensure our nation never again mourns precious lives lost to the avoidable tragedy of bridge failures, like the I-35 collapse in 2007 which stole thirteen beautiful souls and left scores more injured. When America was experiencing the depths of the pandemic and economic crisis, Democrats knew that we had to Build Back Better.? With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, our nation took an historic step for the future – and the Democratic Congress remains hard at work fighting For The People, with more jobs, cut taxes and lower costs for all." [Statement, 1/14/22]

Iowa Congresswoman Cindy Axne: "Iowa leads the nation in structurally deficient bridges – but with this new funding from our bipartisan infrastructure law reaching Iowa, we have the opportunity to instead lead the nation in revitalized bridges and restored confidence in our commutes and commerce.

[Statement, 1/14/22]

Missouri Congressman Emanuel Cleaver: "Bridges are more than just elevated concrete and steel—they connect families, workers, and small businesses with the resources and opportunities that allow our communities to thrive. It brings me great joy to announce the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I helped pass in Congress will soon deliver nearly $97 million to Missouri as the first portion of a five-year investment to modernize and repair bridges across our great state. With more than 1,100 bridges in the Fifth Congressional District—many of which have been in desperate need of repair for years—this historic investment is going to provide the funding needed to begin projects that have been stalled for far too long. Not only will this increase the safety of Missourians who traffic over these bridges every day, but it will also create plenty of good-paying jobs and stimulate economic growth in communities throughout the Show Me State. This funding will provide an opportunity to reconnect numerous communities that were divided due to the construction of the interstate highway system nearly a century ago. Additionally, there are a number of small bridges that have a huge impact on communities all over the Fifth District that can begin to be rehabilitated. I couldn't be prouder to have supported the legislation that made this funding possible, and I look forward to working with the Governor on a bipartisan basis to ensure the needs of the Fifth Congressional District are met—which is only fair considering every other Representative in our state voted to turn away this federal funding that Missouri so desperately needs." [Statement, 1/14/22]

National Association of Counties: "With America's county governments being responsible for nearly 40 percent of all public bridges, the National Association of Counties (NACo) today welcomed the first step toward making resources from the new Bridge Investment Program (BIP) fully available to state and local governments. The program, which was established by the recently enacted bipartisan infrastructure law, will provide $40 billion over five years to improve and enhance bridges. While this announcement represents the deployment of BIP formula funds to state departments of transportation, counties are directly impacted by the program's funding and incentives for bridges that are not part of the federal highway system.
Counties applaud our federal partners in Congress and the administration for bipartisan efforts to strengthen America's bridges. Counties own and operate nearly 240,000 bridges – vital connections between people and places. Locally owned bridges are instrumental in everything from facilitating daily commutes to shipping goods around the globe. The costs of maintaining this essential infrastructure often outstrips our local resources. We appreciate our congressional champions in both parties who worked with us to ensure local bridges were not left behind in the creation of this program, and our partners at the U.S. Department of Transportation who continue to invest in locally owned infrastructure.
Key items for counties in the rollout of BIP formula funding include:

Each state is guaranteed a $45 million floor annually in BIP funds, making at least $6.75 million available for off-system bridges in all 50 states.
The program requires state departments of transportation to expend at least 15 percent of BIP formula funds on off-system bridge projects.
The program also includes incentive for states to further invest in off-system bridges beyond the 15 percent set-aside by providing a 100 percent federal cost share for these projects.

Counties play a major role in maintaining critical infrastructure. Counties:

Own 44 percent of the nation's road miles and nearly 40 percent of all bridges
Are involved in 78 percent of public transportation systems and a third of public airports
Are responsible for the operation of many local water systems
Invest $134 billion annually in the construction of infrastructure and the maintenance and operation of public works, and
Ensure the safety and resiliency of our communities." [Statement, 1/13/22]
