    I applaud Congress for working in a bipartisan manner to pass a stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act. Our Nation is committed to maintaining our thriving commercial and recreational fishing communities. This bill embraces my priorities of ending over-fishing and rebuilding our Nation's fish stocks through more effective, market-based management and tougher enforcement. This landmark legislation also provides stronger tools to achieve progress internationally to ensure healthy fish stocks, promote better management, and halt destructive fishing practices based on sound science.
Since my administration released the Ocean Action Plan in 2004, we have been making great strides in our efforts to make our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive. Enactment of this bill is one of the top priorities of the Ocean Action Plan and is another significant bipartisan environmental achievement.
