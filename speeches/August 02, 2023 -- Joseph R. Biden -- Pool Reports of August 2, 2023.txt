Out of town pool report #1: Gordons Pond
Greetings from another exciting morning in Rehoboth, where President Biden, fresh off an Oppenheimer viewing and a moonlit beach walk with the first lady, seems to be vacationing with vigor.
It is 72 degrees and sunny.
Pool was swept and we are holding in a parking lot near Gordons Pond at 9:19 am, near the North Shores neighborhood where the Bidens have their beach home. A wildlife sign nearby calls this area a "lively locale."
It's good bike-riding weather.

Out of town pool report #2: Biden bike ride
The president biked by at 9:52 am, trailed by a single Secret Service agent on a bike, and a golf cart full of medical staffers and agents. The first lady did not accompany him this time.
"How are ya?" he asked the pool as he cruised by. POTUS did not stop to hear the reply. (We're fine.)
Bike ride ongoing. We are holding again at a pavilion.

Out of town pool report #3: Unanswered questions
At 10:35 am, POTUS rode by on his way toward his home.
He did not answer a question from Jeff Mason of Reuters about the Fitch downgrade.
Will Weissert of AP shouted "INDICTMENTS?" - context not really necessary - and also got no answer.
Some onlookers cheered the president as he exited the area.
Pool is making its way to our Ace Limosine van.

Out of town pool report #4: Lunch lid until 2 pm
The possibilities are endless.

Out of town pool report #5: Lid is lifted
False alarm.
POTUS apparently can't get enough of Gordons Pond so that is where we are headed.

Out of town pool report #6: Holding
Pool is still holding near the beach with a lifted lunch lid and we are told it now may be awhile until we see POTUS, in case anyone out there was hankering for an update.
We have requested a bathroom break.

Out of town pool report #7: Beach visit
Pool was brought near a beach entrance and spotted Jill Biden, with her hair in a ponytail and wearing a printed tunic, heading toward the beach at 1:08 pm.
Then we waited.
The president emerged from his SUV at 2:02 pm but was not in clear view of the pool. Your pooler could eventually see the president, flanked by agents and walking very slowly down the path to the beach.
Some color from the side of the road:
Tom Farrell and Genieve Kocienda, who are in town vacationing from Arlington, Va., were among the president's onlookers. They said they unexpectedly saw the president earlier today on the bike trail and said POTUS gave them a thumbs up.
They said they had been swept by the USSS before they joined the trail and were told to keep on the right side of the trail for their journey.
For their second POTUS sighting, the couple stayed long enough to see the president get out of his vehicle and disappear behind the pines.

Out of town pool report #8: Beach color-ish
Pool was brought to the beach at 2:09 pm. The first lady was there waiting for him.
We were hundreds of yards away but POTUS was tapping on a phone and at one point passed the phone to the first lady. He also waved to onlookers.
Pool was escorted out at 2:11 pm.

Out of town pool #9: Quick lid until 3 or 3:05 pm

Out of town pool #10: Beach departure & lid
Pool was swept and assembled quickly to catch POTUS's departure.
POTUS and the first lady left the beach at 3:31 pm. Jeff Mason and your pooler asked him how his day was going/how his vacation is going.
"Hard to complain about this weather," POTUS said, clutching a towel in hand, before he ducked into his SUV.
He gave a wave and a thumbs up through his armored window as his SUV passed the pool.
Anthony Bernal, who was among the aides flanking the first couple as they came away from the beach, whizzed by on a bike and said bye to the pool on his way from the beach to the house. Drew Rodriguez, another East Wing aide, carried some beachy-looking tote bags.
The WH called a lid for the day at 3:34 pm.
