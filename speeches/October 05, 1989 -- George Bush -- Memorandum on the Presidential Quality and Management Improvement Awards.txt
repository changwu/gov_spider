    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Presidential Quality and Management Improvement Awards
The strength and success of the United States depend upon the performance of the 4.3 million civil servants and uniformed services personnel around the world. My experience in Government confirms that their skills, abilities, and dedication not only provide the necessary continuity of government, but also contribute to the growth and prosperity of our Nation. Their work in important and diverse areas, such as scientific and medical research, national defense and security, protection of our environment, air and highway safety, education, and service to our veterans and their families, represents important contributions to the quality of life of our citizens.
Accordingly, I am calling on you to enlist the talents and creativity of your employees in a partnership to serve the needs of all Americans. To do this, I ask that you communicate the attached message announcing the Presidential Quality and Management Improvement Awards Program to the men and women in the Government service.
Knowing how much their actions contribute to significant improvements in Government operations and services to the public, I am requesting that you inform me of such efforts so that I may add my personal congratulations by letter of commendation. Further, for those contributions judged to be of greatest benefit, I intend to grant Presidential Quality and Management Improvement Awards. Instructions for the administration of this Program will be issued by the Office of Personnel Management.
The people of our country deserve the very best and most efficient services that the Federal Government can provide. Through your personal support and that of your employees, I am very confident that we can continue to earn their trust and to meet this commitment.
George Bush
