    "The future doesn't belong to Trump and his billionaire friends, it belongs to us"
DES MOINES â€” Bernie 2020 on Monday released a new ad in Iowa focused on the corruption and greed of Donald Trump and the corporate special interests that are undermining our democracy.
In the ad titled, "Belongs To Us," Sen. Sanders calls Donald Trump the most corrupt president in American history. He goes on to explain that the only way to defeat him and the billionaires that have a stranglehold on our economy is through a mass movement of people from across the country who can demand the change we need to transform our government to one that works for all of us and not just one-percent.
The ad comes on the heels of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez joining Sen. Sanders in Iowa this past weekend where they hosted the largest rallies of this election cycle in Iowa and organized a historic Iowa Climate Crisis Summit in Des Moines. At the Summit and at rallies across Iowa, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez called for divesting from the greed and corruption of the fossil fuel industry and investing in a Green New Deal and railed against billionaire greed and their class solidarity that hurts working people.
The 30-second spot will begin airing this week and is one of several digital and TV ads created by the campaign's in-house team. The full ad can be seen here and the transcript is below:
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in American history. But the greed and corruption undermining our democracy is bigger than one man, and so is the solution.
When we stand together, we will make billionaires pay their fair share, provide better wages for workers and equal pay for women. We will expand Social Security and guarantee healthcare for all.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approved this message because the future doesn't belong to Trump and his billionaire friends, it belongs to us."
