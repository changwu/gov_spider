    ARLINGTON, VA -- McCain-Palin 2008 today released the following statement by John McCain on reports of pending General Motors plant closings:
"I'm disappointed to hear of the upcoming General Motors plant closings. Hardworking people are paying the price because our country's leaders have put Washington corruption and Wall Street greed before Main Street's interests for too long. Change is coming. I know families across America are hurting and as president, I will lead members of both parties in a fight to keep and create good jobs in communities across the country. Now is not a time for words and platitudes. Now is a time for action. That is why I supported auto industry loan guarantees and will continue to work to create opportunities for American auto companies to build the car of the 21st century and put Americans back to work."
