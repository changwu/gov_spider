    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose 3 new rescissions of budget authority previously provided by the Congress, totalling $128.0 million. In addition, I am reporting 24 new deferrals totalling $825.5 million, and revisions to five previously reported deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $876.4 million.
The rescission proposals affect programs of the Department of the Interior and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank. The deferrals affect Appalachian regional development programs, programs in the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and Transportation, as well as the Veterans Administration, the General Services Administration, and the Small Business Administration.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
