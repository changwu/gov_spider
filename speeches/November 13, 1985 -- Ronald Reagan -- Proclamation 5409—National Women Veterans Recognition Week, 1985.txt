  A Proclamation

We Americans are justly indebted to all who have served in uniform in the cause of our national defense. It is an honor for me to invite special attention to the unique contributions made to that cause by women veterans.
Throughout our Nation's history, American women have answered duty's call, even when that call exacted a great price. Many women have become casualties in their country's service, and countless more have suffered family disruptions and dislocations caused by commitments to the armed services.
The nearly 1.2 million women veterans living in the United States today have contributed immeasurably to restoring and maintaining the peace. Their performance in a wide range of demanding specialties in all branches of service has been in the proudest traditions of our Armed Forces, and it is altogether fitting that we as a Nation pause to express our appreciation.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 47, has designated the week beginning November 10, 1985, as "National Women Veterans Recognition Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 10, 1985, as National Women Veterans Recognition Week. I call upon the American people, the Federal government, and State and local governments to celebrate this week with appropriate observances.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
