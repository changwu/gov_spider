    Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake made the following statement following tonight's debate in Mesa, Arizona:
"Mitt Romney was the winner in tonight's debate because he clearly articulated a bold conservative vision to restore fiscal sanity to our country. America has had enough of high taxes, out-of-control spending, and ignoring the need for entitlement reform. Mitt Romney has shown that he is not afraid of bold solutions to restore America's promise. I'm proud to stand with Mitt. He is the conservative leader we need to reform Washington."
