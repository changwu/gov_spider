    MRS. OBAMA: I came out here to take a picture with all of you -- but because this daycare center that you guys get to go to is doing so good at making you guys healthy and making sure that you're running around and staying active. Because one of the things we learn is that if you guys stay active -- healthy, you'll grow up to be healthy adults like all of our friends here. These are grown-up vegetables. (Laughter.) And they started out as little bitty vegetables just like you. And because they kept eating right and exercising, they grew up to be really big and strong. And that's what Let's Move is all about -- it's making sure that you guys grow up big and strong.
And we just got some great statistics that show that the obesity rate among kids this age is declining. (Applause.) And it's because of the work that you all are doing here. It's this kind of work that is helping to get those results for kids across the country.
So we wanted to come here and highlight the great work that you're doing. We're so proud of you guys. Give yourselves a big round of applause. (Applause.)
