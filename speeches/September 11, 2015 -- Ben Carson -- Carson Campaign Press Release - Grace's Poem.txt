    This morning, I was given a poem by a twelve year old named Grace. I was moved so much that I wanted to share it with you.
.....as our differences were put on display, the world looked on in
morbid disbelief and as the outside agitators began to rise, hope and
peace began to weep.
For our differences is what makes us great, that's why America's light
shines so bright throughout the land, for we must shine that light
within our hearts, so we can find common ground and understanding.
We were all created equal by the hand of God, whether we are black,
white or blue, we must find new ways to minimize our differences, so
let's tear down the walls of segregation, rebuild and start anew.
Just as the ravishing fragrance of an immaculate rose, piercing the
hollow air on a dark and rainy day, let us stand as the beautiful
colors of Ferguson, declaring to the rest of the world, We know The
Way!!!
