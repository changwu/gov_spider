Pool report 4/14 #6 
The White House sent the following to pooler.
Excerpts from President Biden’s Remarks on Afghanistan As Prepared for Delivery
We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result.
I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats.
I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth.
After consulting closely with our Allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence professionals, with our diplomats and development experts, and with Congress and the Vice President, I have concluded that:
It is time to end America’s longest war. It is time for American troops to come home.
---
While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue.
We will continue to support the Government of Afghanistan.
We will keep providing assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. Along with our partners, we are training and equipping nearly 300,000 personnel. And they continue to fight valiantly on behalf of their country and defend the Afghan people, at great cost.
We will support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations.
---
We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago.
That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.
Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that will determine our standing and reach today and into the years to come.

Pool report 4/11 #11 
The president exited his car at 3:09 p.m. at Arlington National Cemetery. It was raining. He was greeted by (per press office):
Karen Durham-Aguilera, Executive Director Army National Military Cemeteries, Arlington National Cemetery and Office of Army Cemeteries
SGM Patrick D. Thomas, Senior Enlisted Advisor, Office of Army Cemeteries
He walked through the grass past several headstones. He carried an umbrella in his hand but did not use it. He stopped to look at a red, white, and blue wreath.
He looked at reporters and said: "Hard to believe, isn't it?"
He then took two questions from reporters. One was about what this moment means to him and another about whether pulling troops out of Afghanistan was a hard decision. It was difficult to hear answers, here are some highlights. Will need to check tape for direct quotes.
First question: "I'm always amazed at generation after generation, the women, the men prepared to give their lives for their country."
Second question: "No it wasn't" a hard decision to make. "It was absolutely clear."
Pool loaded in vans as of 3:19 p.m. Rolling as of 3:22 p.m.

Pool report 4/14 #13 
Special thanks to TV poolers for help with audio. Here are quotes from POTUS visit to Arlington National Cemetery and a few more details.
Details: 
After walking through the grass, he stopped at the wreath and held it. He made the sign of the cross and then saluted.
Quotes: 
Reporter: What does this day mean for you? (Not a direct quote.)
"It means that I'm always amazed at generation after generation, the women and men prepared to give their lives for their country. They don't give it for their country per se, they give it for their brothers, their sisters, their mothers, their fathers, their uncles, their aunts."
"It means I have trouble these days ever showing up at a cemetery not thinking of my son, Beau, who proudly insisted on putting on that uniform and going with his unit to Iraq and giving up his spot as attorney general in the state of Delaware because he thought it was the right thing to do."
Reporter: "Was it a hard decision to make sir?"
POTUS: "No, it wasn't. To me, it was absolutely clear. Absolutely clear. We went for two reasons: the end of Bin Laden and the end of safe haven. From the very beginning, you may recall, I never thought we were there to somehow unify Iraq. Excuse me, Afghanistan. It's never been done. It's never been done."
