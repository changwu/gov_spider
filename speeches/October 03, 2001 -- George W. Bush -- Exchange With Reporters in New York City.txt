    President's Visit
Q. What's your message for New York, sir?
The President. My message for New York is they've got great leadership—got great leadership with the mayor, got great leadership with the Governor, and all of America is proud, proud of the resilience of this city, too. People are coming together. It's an amazing feeling to be here in New York City. On the one hand, you see the destruction; on the other hand, you see—feel the compassion of a great city. I'm real proud to be here with my friends.
See you at the school.
