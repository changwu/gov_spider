    General Manager Mike Boldrick. Mr. President, we'd like to welcome you to Triadelphia, West Virginia. It's a suburb of Wheeling. This is a new Cabela store. As you can see, it's 175,000 square feet. We're going to be bringing up to 1,200 new jobs to the area eventually. We currently have 450 people——
The President. Four hundred fifty good people, I might add.
Mr. Boldrick. ——on staff. We'll draw upwards of 5 or 6 million visitors a year to this location alone, making it the number one tourist attraction in the State of West Virginia.
Marketing Manager John Castillo. And the best news is, we're building two more of these down in Texas next year.
The President. Oh, that's great.
Mr. Boldrick. We'd like to present you with a Cabela's hat and a rain slicker.
The President. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for having me. Listen, thanks for having me. I've come by because, first, I love to hunt and fish; secondly, because I heard you're expanding the job base here. Over 1,200 new jobs is really good news for this part of the country.
Mr. Boldrick. Absolutely.
The President. I want to thank you all for expanding your operations. You picked a great place in the world to come.
Mr. Boldrick. We love it here.
The President. Good, hard-working decent folks who are going to make you proud. So thanks for your hospitality. I love being here with you all.
