    President Bush. It is such a joy to be here to Graceland. It's my first visit.
Prime Minister Koizumi. My first visit too.
President Bush. The Prime Minister's first visit.
Prime Minister Koizumi. It's like a dream, with President Bush and Presley's daughter.
President Bush. Thank you all for greeting us. You're awfully kind to be here.
Prime Minister Koizumi. You look like Elvis.
[At this point, the late entertainer Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, spoke in Japanese, and no translation was provided.]
President Bush. The visit here is an indication of how well-known Elvis was around the world. A lot of people are still singing Elvis Presley songs here in the States, and there's a lot of people who love Elvis Presley in Japan, including the Prime Minister. This visit is also a way of reminding us about the close friendship between our peoples.
And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for agreeing to come here. A lot of Americans are thrilled you're here, particularly to Graceland. It means a lot to our country that you would be that interested in one of America's icons, Elvis Presley.
Prime Minister Koizumi. My birthday is the same as Elvis's.
President Bush. You and Elvis were born on the same day?
Prime Minister Koizumi. January 8th. Even now, I often listen to Elvis CDs.
President Bush. Still listen to Elvis CDs?
Prime Minister Koizumi. Sure.
President Bush. You're a pretty good Elvis singer.
Prime Minister Koizumi. I'm not impersonator.
[Prime Minister Koizumi sang an Elvis song.]
President Bush. I thought you were going to do "Blue Suede Shoes." Thank you.
