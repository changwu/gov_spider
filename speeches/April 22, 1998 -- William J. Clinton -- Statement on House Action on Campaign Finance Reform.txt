    I am very pleased that the House Republican leadership will heed the call of congressional reformers and allow a vote on campaign finance reform. I strongly support the bipartisan legislation offered by Representatives Christopher Shays and Marty Meehan, which is the best chance in a generation for real reform. Similar legislation already has the support of a majority of Senators, yet it has been blocked by a minority on procedural grounds. Now every Member of the House of Representatives has a responsibility to vote for this measure to ban large soft money contributions, improve disclosure, and restrict backdoor campaign spending. A vote for bipartisan campaign finance reform will be a vote to strengthen our democracy and give ordinary voters a stronger voice.
