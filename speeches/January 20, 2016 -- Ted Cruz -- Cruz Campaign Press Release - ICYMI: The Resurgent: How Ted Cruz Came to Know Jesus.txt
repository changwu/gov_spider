    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today in The Resurgent, Erick Erickson writes about Ted Cruz's personal journey of faith and how his father found the Lord, after walking out on Cruz and his mother. This journey profoundly influences Cruz's life and affects how Cruz would govern the United States as President with moral clarity and conservative values. Erickson writes, "This is not a stunt for Ted Cruz. His father walked out on the family, lost himself in a bottle, and was finally rescued by a Bible Study and a preacher willing to debate and answer questions."

I hear friends say Ted Cruz sounds like a preacher. They say he is using the gospel to round up voters. They don't like it and they are not sure if Ted is authentic. The Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who watched his sister consumed by a heroine addiction. She died of an overdose. The Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who maxed out his credit cards to rescue his sister's son from that situation. The Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who, as a boy, was abandoned by his father and watched his mother struggle. And the Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who came to know Jesus as his Lord and Savior and credits the Lord with bringing back his father.
Ted Cruz is a not an academic evangelical. He's a country music evangelical. He lost his father, found Jesus, got back his father, lost his sister, and did what it took to keep his family above water. When he gets on a stage and connects with Christian audiences, yes he is trying to woo Christians to his side, but he also believes in the power of scripture. This is not a stunt for Ted Cruz.
