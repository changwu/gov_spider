    Last night Governor Scott Walker took the stage in Cleveland, OH, for the first Republican debate of the 2016 election. And what a great debate he had. If you weren't able to catch the entire two-hour event, we've put together this 90-second clip with some of Governor Walker's best lines.
Here are eight photos from the Quicken Loans Center, that our team on the ground took to let you experience the excitement of last night's debate for yourself.
