    IN THE annals .of medicine, Dr. Paul Dudley White will be remembered as a man who not only revolutionized the treatment of heart disease but also educated millions of Americans on ways to prevent heart attacks. His services in this field were great and, taken by themselves, would justify his place in history.
But Dr. White will also be remembered as the inspired physician who guided President Eisenhower back to health from his critical heart attack in 1955, an achievement that won him the gratitude of an entire nation.
He has left us after a full and rich life and a dedicated medical career during which he treated over 12,000 people, rich and poor, famous and obscure. He will long stand as a model of all that is best in American medicine--a source of pride to physicians and laymen alike.
