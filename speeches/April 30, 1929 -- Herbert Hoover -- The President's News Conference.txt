    THE PRESIDENT. I haven't a single question from the press this morning. Apparently you have no curiosity whatever. So I don't know that I have any starting point for a discussion.
WILLIAM A. DEGROOT
I had an inquiry from one member of the press yesterday with regard to Mr. DeGroot in New York. I haven't yet received a report from the Attorney General on that subject, and therefore I haven't anything that I can add to it.
THE ROLE OF THE PRESS IN NEWS CONFERENCES
But I think you will have to take a part of this labor upon yourselves and indicate some directions in which you would like a little information. A press conference is a conference that works both ways, and I do not know that I can stand up here and deliver orations or essays or mandates or anything of that kind unless I have some suggestions from your side.
So that is all I have on my mind today, I am sorry to say.
