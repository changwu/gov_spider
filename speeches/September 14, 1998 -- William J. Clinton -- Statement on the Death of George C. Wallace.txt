    Hillary and I offer our condolences to the family and friends of George Wallace. I remember working with him at the Governors' conference in 1983. Governor Wallace was wheelchair-bound and often in great pain, but he rolled into the committee room to provide the crucial vote that enabled the Governors to help save Federal support for disabled Americans unable to work.
Like the State he served as Governor and the region he represented as a candidate for President, George Wallace made a painful—but essential—journey, abandoning, in the end, the politics of division and embracing the politics of inclusion and reconciliation. For that, all Americans can be grateful.
