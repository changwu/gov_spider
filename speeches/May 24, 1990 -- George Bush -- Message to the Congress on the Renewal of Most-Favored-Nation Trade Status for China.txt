    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit documentation referred to in subsection 402(d)(5) of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to a further 12-month extension of the authority to waive subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the act. These documents constitute my decision to continue in effect this waiver authority for a further 12-month period.
I include as part of these documents my determination that further extension of the waiver authority will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. I also include my determination that continuation of the waiver applicable to the People's Republic of China will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. The attached documents also include my reasons for extension of the waiver authority and for my determination that continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's Republic of China will substantially promote the objectives of section 402.
An additional document and determination with respect to Czechoslovakia will be forwarded under separate cover.
