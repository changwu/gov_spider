    Yesterday, after the violence in Portland, I put out a statement decrying violence under any political banner, and challenged the President to do the same. Today, I traveled to Pittsburgh to explain how the President was making America less safe — on COVID, on the economy, on crime, on racism, on violence — and reiterated my clear message that violence is not the answer to any of these problems. And again, I urged the President to use his voice to the same end.
Tonight, the President declined to rebuke violence. He wouldn't even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder because of his attacks on others. He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.
So once again, I urge the President to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is a right — a necessity — violence is wrong, period. No matter who does it, no matter what political affiliation they have. Period.
If Donald Trump can't say that, then he is unfit to be President, and his preference for more violence — not less — is clear.
