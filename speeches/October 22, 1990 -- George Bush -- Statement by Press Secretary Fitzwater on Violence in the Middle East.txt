    The President deplores the tragic killing of three Israeli citizens in West Jerusalem yesterday. The President offers his condolences to the families of the victims. These killings make it all the more imperative that the cycle of violence be ended. We urge all parties to act to reenforce peace and calm in the region.
Similarly, another tragedy is the assassination of Dany Chamoun and his family in Lebanon. And we reiterate our call for all Lebanese to unite behind the government of President Harawi. As we have said, it is now time for national reconciliation in Lebanon and for the creation of a free, independent, and sovereign nation -- free of foreign forces and armed militia. We hope that the reunited army and the Lebanese people will support President Harawi in the effort to implement the Taif agreement.
