    WELL, I WANT to say while you are here--as Mrs. Boggs was saying--this is a sad day in a way, but also a very happy day because all of the family is here to see you sworn into Congress.
And I suppose many will interpret her victory and also her service as simply the fact that she was the wife of the prominent majority leader of Congress, and that because of that and only because of that, she is here.
However, those of us who know her, as I know her, my wife knows her, we have had the privilege of traveling with her on several occasions, she is here in her own right as well. I think her husband would have said that she, on her own, belongs in the Congress of the United States. And I speak in a completely bipartisan way when I say I hope she stays a long time.
REPRESENTATIVE BOGGS. Thank you, Mr. President, so much.
THE PRESIDENT. If I move to Louisiana, I might--I will vote for you. [Laughter]
REPRESENTATIVE BOGGS. That is wonderful. Thank you so much, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. What I meant is that you made it on your own. That is the point.
REPRESENTATIVE BOGGS. Thank you very much.
