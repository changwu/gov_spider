    Tonight I have declared that a major disaster exists in California caused by the damaging floods in northern and southern California. I have directed Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt to oversee the Federal response in the recovery.
FEMA officials are already working closely with State and local officials to ensure a quick response to this flood. Director Witt is in California making sure disaster funds begin to flow quickly to help the people affected by the flood damage. These funds will help to begin the process of recovery.
Californians have a resilient spirit and great sense of community. You have shown over the past year during the earthquake, the fires, and now the current floods that you are a people that come together in times of crisis. The American people support you as you would them in a similar time of need. Our hearts are with the thousands of victims affected by the floods and the family members of those who have died.
