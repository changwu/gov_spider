    AUSTIN — Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement:
"Ambassador Gutman's troubling statement is part of a pattern of hostility on the part of the Obama administration toward Israel. In the same week that Ambassador Gutman excused anti-Semitism because of Israel's refusal to accommodate Palestinian demands, President Obama's Secretary of Defense ranted that the Israelis must get back to the ‘d*** table' for negotiations, and his Secretary of State insinuated that Israel's democracy is less than viable because of gender-related debates between religious and secular segments of Israeli society.
"The long and ugly history of anti-Semitism has seen all too many episodes of apologists justifying hatred of the Jews. Given the gathering threat posed by the brutal regime in Iran, now is the time to strengthen ties with Israel to achieve our mutual security interests.
"President Obama must send a clear signal to the world by relieving Ambassador Gutman of his post, stopping his administration's Israel bashing and recognizing that a two-state solution requires good-faith discussion and negotiation from the Palestinians as well as Israelis."
