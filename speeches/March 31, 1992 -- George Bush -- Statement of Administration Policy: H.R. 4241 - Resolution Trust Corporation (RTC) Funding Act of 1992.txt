    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Wylie (R) Ohio)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4241, which would provide the RTC with the funds it needs to protect depositors and ensure the resolution of failed thrifts. The Administration would prefer that its full request of $55 billion be provided to ensure the completion of the process of resolving insolvent thrift institutions.
