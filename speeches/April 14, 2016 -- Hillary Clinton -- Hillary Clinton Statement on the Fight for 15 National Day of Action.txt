    Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the Fight for 15 National Day of Action today. Clinton held rally for the movement earlier this month with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who successfully lobbied to increase the New York State minimum wage to $15 an hour:
"As I've traveled across the country, I've met many hardworking Americans who have told me that $7.25 an hour is just not enough to support a family. Brave people like Maricarmen Macias, a child care worker in Chicago, who works 17 hours a day but struggles to support her family. And Lizbeth Bonilla from Las Vegas, who's worked for the past 42 years caring for the elderly. They deserve higher pay and the chance to get ahead and stay ahead. That's why I'm proud to stand with Fight for 15 on today's national day of action and all those marching today in New York and in cities and towns across America demanding higher wages and the right to have a voice at work. As a Senator from New York, I introduced or co-sponsored legislation to raise the minimum wage and to defend the right to organize. I believe we need to raise the Federal minimum wage, and I believe that states, cities, and workers should fight to raise it even further. I was proud to stand with Governor Cuomo when he raised the minimum wage to $15 in New York and I hope more places do the same. A higher, fairer minimum wage grows the economy and lifts everyone up. I am inspired by those who march today as part of this important movement that has helped win raises for millions of Americans. They are changing our country for the better. I stand with them, I will champion their cause, and I willfight for them every day as president."
