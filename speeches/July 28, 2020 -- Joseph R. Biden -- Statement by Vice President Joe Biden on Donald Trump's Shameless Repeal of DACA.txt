    After failing at the Supreme Court, the Trump Administration took another cruel step in its misguided crusade to repeal DACA. President Trump will stop at nothing to push his anti-immigrant political agenda, even at the expense of young people who have grown up in this country and are Americans through and through.
Trump's actions would upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of our neighbors, teachers, nurses, doctors, engineers and lawyers, among others. It's wrong, and it's un-American. The America I know fights for our own and that's exactly who DACA recipients are - our own.
It's unconscionable that the Trump Administration has continued its attacks on DACA recipients, especially while our country is battling COVID-19 and many of these young people are risking their lives to keep us safe and healthy. Nearly a third of all current DACA recipients are essential workers helping our communities respond to the pandemic. Close to 30,000 of them are front-line health care workers.
This November, voters must reject the politics that play with the lives of immigrant young people and jeopardize public health to divide families and rip apart communities. As President, I will protect Dreamers and their families and offer a roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and all 11 million undocumented immigrants enriching our country, so they no longer have to live in fear and uncertainty. In a Biden Administration, Dreamers can make plans to prosper and thrive here in America- right where they belong.
