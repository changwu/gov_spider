PAUL RYAN: "I think President Obama has placed us on a path to decline. Four budgets, four trillion dollar deficits. Twenty three million people struggling to find work. The highest poverty rates in a generation. Nearly one out of six Americans in poverty, and we just learned on Friday that it's the 43rd month of unemployment above 8 percent. For every person who got a job last month, nearly four stopped looking for work. That's not a good direction. That's the wrong direction. I mean, George, we have to create 150,000 jobs every month just to keep up with population growth, and we didn't even do that. It's on the wrong path."
