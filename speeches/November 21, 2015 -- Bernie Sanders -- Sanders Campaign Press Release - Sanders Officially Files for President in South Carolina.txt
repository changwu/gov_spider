Reg E. Cathey, best known for his recurring role as "Freddy" from Netflix's hit series "House of Cards," introduced Sanders by announcing he was "glad to officially join the political revolution."
State Rep. Terry Alexander (D-Florence), a chair of Sanders' South Carolina leadership committee, also spoke.
