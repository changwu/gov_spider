    President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will celebrate Independence Day at the White House by welcoming military families to the South Lawn for an afternoon picnic.

"I'm delighted to welcome this new addition to the annual White House July 4th celebration," said First Lady Melania Trump. "Americans will be able to tune in from their homes and be part of the festivities. Thank you to the National Park Service, the National Park Foundation, and the event sponsors for helping make this possible."
