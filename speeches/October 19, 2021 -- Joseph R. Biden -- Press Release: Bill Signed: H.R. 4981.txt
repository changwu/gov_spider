    On Tuesday, October 19, 2021, the President signed into law:
H.R.4981, "To amend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, to modify certain deadlines relating to the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking." This bill will extend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act deadline for the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking by 120 days to allow the Commission to continue its work until February 2022. This deadline was for the Commission to report on the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States and to develop a strategic approach to combat the supply and locate the origins of these substances.
Thank you to Representatives Trone and Upton and Senators Cotton and Markey for their leadership.
