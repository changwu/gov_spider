Dear Mr. President:
I congratulate you on your re-election as President of the Republic of Finland. It is my sincere wish and that of the people of the United States that you will enjoy a successful term of office. I look back with satisfaction upon your visit to the United States, which did much to reinforce the traditional bonds of friendship between our two nations. May that friendship flourish and be strengthened still further during your presidency in these challenging years.
Please accept my warm greetings and best wishes.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
