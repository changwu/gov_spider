    SANTA FE, NM -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today formally accepted an invitation to appear in the first ever Democratic Presidential candidate debate to be conducted entirely in Spanish. Governor Richardson was the first candidate to agree to participate in the debate, which will be held in Miami, Florida on Sunday, September 9, and is being sponsored by Univision Communications and the University of Miami.
"This is an extraordinary opportunity to reach the Latino community which will play a pivotal role in choosing the next President," said Governor Richardson. "Latinos are the fastest growing segment of our population and this is a unique chance for all of the candidates to hear and address the concerns and priorities of this important constituency."
Born in Pasadena, California, Governor Richardson spent his childhood in Mexico City and is bilingual.
"I challenge my fellow Democratic candidates to participate in this debate and not to find reasons to avoid it- diversity is a fundamental Democratic issue," added the Governor. "We should be committed to reaching the broadest range of Americans possible, and the Latino community is critical to winning the nomination and the Presidency in 2008."
