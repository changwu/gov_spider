LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted a peculiar 8,500-plus voters to the third of three town hall meetings he held in California this week, this time at UC-Berkeley. In drawing such a huge crowd to Berkeley, the 12-term Congressman from Texas shattered his unrivaled town hall meeting attendance record.
At similar events held yesterday and Tuesday, respectively, Dr. Paul drew remarkable crowds of 6,200-plus voters to Cal State — Chico, and 6,000-plus at UCLA.
Ron Paul's college campus town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. PST at UC-Berkeley's Memorial Glade, where he addressed the crowd from atop the steps of Doe Library, Berkeley, CA 94720.
Dr. Paul spoke about his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the enduring bonds between economic and civil liberties, and elements of his 'Plan to Restore America,' a fiscal blueprint the cuts Washington spending, shrinks the national debt, and reverses the federal government's harmful growth and intrusiveness.
Ron Paul's town hall meetings in California were organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP). YFP, an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign, launched in September 2011, and since its inception, students nationwide have organized 591 chapters and recruited more than 53,600 people.
