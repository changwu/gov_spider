    It was Bernie Sanders' turn to go on Jimmy Kimmel Thursday one night after Donald Trump sat down with the late-night talk show host. Passing along a question from Sanders, Kimmel had asked the Republican presidential candidate if he would debate Sanders. Trump said yes. "Game on," Sanders tweeted.

  
Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.

Sanders had hoped to debate Hillary Clinton in California, but she backed out of her agreement to a debate before the Golden State's June 7 primary election. Sanders called that "kind of an insult to the people of the largest state."
During his stop at the Los Angeles studio, Sanders also talked about Clinton's lead among so-called superdelegates — elected officials and party leaders. More than 400 superdelegates endorsed Clinton even before the White House campaign began. Sanders called that "pretty absurd and undemocratic."
