    Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jake Sullivan released the following statement on Donald Trump's response to the Brexit vote and its impact on American families:
"Yesterday, amidst the global economic uncertainty that followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union, American families watched as their 401(k) accounts lost more than $100 billion in value over the course of a day. Now, we believe that America is resilient and can bounce back, but here is the point:  While markets tumbled and American families' pocketbooks took a hit, Donald Trump cheered and celebrated. He patted himself on the back and boasted about the money that his golf courses would make as a result of the turmoil. At a time when the world looks to the United States for steady leadership, Donald Trump once again proved two truths about his candidacy – that he is temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States and that he is in it for no one but himself."
