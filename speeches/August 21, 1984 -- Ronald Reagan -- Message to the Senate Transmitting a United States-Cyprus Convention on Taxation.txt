    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with an exchange of notes, signed at Nicosia on March 19, 1984. I also transmit the report of the Department of State on the Convention.
The Convention replaces an earlier convention signed at Nicosia on March 26, 1980, but returned by the Senate for renegotiation in December 1981. The new Convention incorporates the provisions of the 1980 treaty and includes revisions designed to eliminate the potential for abuse by third-country residents.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention, with the related exchange of notes, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
