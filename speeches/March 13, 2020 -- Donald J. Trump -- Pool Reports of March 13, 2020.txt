Pool Report #4 - Press Conference
The Rose Garden event lasted for about an hour and 13 minutes. As you all know it was open coverage and televised live.
POTUS was accompanied by what seemed a cast of zillions but in truth was 18 individuals led by VP Pence, Secretary Azar, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Ambassador Deborah Birx, Seema Verma and captains of industry; WH issued the full list earlier. Almost all were invited by the President to speak; in most cases their remarks were less than a minute each, except for Pence, Fauci, and Birx ,who spoke at length.
The partly cloudy weather was in the low 70s and a light breeze blew off some of the blossoms from a couple of crabapple trees flanking the oversized dais. Social distancing note: there were easily 200 individuals in the Rose Garden, likely more.
As telegraphed, POTUS declared a national state of emergency allowing the government to cut through red tape, getting FEMA into the act by freeing up about $42 billion of emergency funds to help expand and speech coronavirus testing.
He took questions for about 37 minutes, including multiple handoffs to Pence and Fauci and several other participants.
Various items:
"I don't take responsibility at all" for what some experts have argued was a sluggish and chaotic rampup to combating the crisis.The President said there were rules and regs "from a different time" that had hampered progress but added that the problem is "not the fault of anybody." He said several times that his emergency declaration and other aggressive moves announced today and to come have kickstarted the government's counterattack and predicted positive results were only a matter of time - "a number of weeks."
Faunci said "there will be many more cases" but nobody was asked exactly how many citizens will test positive for the virus. POTUS said the next eight weeks are critical.
Trump said he hadn't been tested but seemed to hint strongly he probably will be although his physician doesn't see the need and he (POTUS) has zero symptoms. Again he said people shouldn't insist on testing unless their physician thinks it necessary.
Style note: After his brief remarks, the executive vice president of LHC Group, Bruce Greenstein, initiated an elbow bump with the President. "I like that, that's good," Trump noted.
