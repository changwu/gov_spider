Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all those who have been killed and with those injured, including members of the Turkish military. We stand together with Turkey, a NATO Ally, a strong partner, and a valued member of the Counter-ISIL coalition, in the face of this attack and pledge our ongoing cooperation and support in the fight against terrorism.
