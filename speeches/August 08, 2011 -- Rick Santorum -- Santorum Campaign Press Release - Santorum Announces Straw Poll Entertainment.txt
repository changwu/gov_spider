Urbandale, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced today he and his family will culminate their "Courage to Fight for American Values" tour with a summer dance party that will bring the best of Iowa to the Ames event on Saturday, August 13th.
Headlining the "Santorum Summer Dance Party" at the Ames Straw Poll will be the famed band of Buddy Holly, "The Crickets," and the son of Rock-and-Roll legend "The Big Bopper." Known as staples in Iowa, particularly the community of Clear Lake, both "The Crickets" and "The Big Bopper Jr." will take the stage throughout the day of the Ames Straw Poll. Each year, Clear Lake celebrates a Winter Dance Party to commemorate the last concert of Buddy Holly and the Crickets, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens.
In addition to these family-friendly, Iowa fan-favorites, the Santorum's will be offering straw poll attendees Iowa pork burgers for lunch. To add a little touch of home, the Santorum's will be handing out samples of their homemade "Presidential Peach Preserves" to all guests. Prior to traveling to Iowa, the Santorum's picked over 600 peaches from their family's peach trees, peeled them, and made jam for all attendees to enjoy. The Santorum children will be handing out samples to attendees. In addition, the Santorum tent will have games for children and adults, and also feature additional Iowa musical talent.
"After three weeks of traveling across Iowa and meeting thousands of Iowans, we are excited to cap off our family trip with a day of fun in Ames," said Senator Santorum. "We are all looking forward to eating, singing, and dancing along with the traditions that make summertime in Iowa the epitomizes the heart of the American experience."
A more detailed line-by-line of entertainment and activities will be released later.
