    Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Lindsey Graham 2016 Senior Advisor Paul Young made the following statement in support of New Hampshire Republican State Committee Chairman Jennifer Horn's statement on reports regarding the role that the First-in-the-Nation primary state plays in the country's political process:
"New Hampshire's first in the nation status has been a constant in our political process for decades and it works. Any talk of changing this proven system where engaged voters in a small state fully analyze the candidates on issues of substance is irresponsible and a bad idea. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina work for our nominating process; Lindsey Graham does not believe it should change."
