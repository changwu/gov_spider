    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period December 1, 2002, through January 31, 2003. The previous submission covered events from October 1, 2002, through November 30, 2002.
My Administration was particularly active during this reporting period in supporting U.N. Secretary-General Annan's efforts to foster a comprehensive Cyprus settlement on the basis of the plan he has proposed. Although such a settlement did not emerge at the European Union's Summit in Copenhagen in December, intense diplomatic activity has continued. Secretary Powell, Under Secretary Marc Grossman, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Weston, and Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson are encouraging all relevant parties to maintain a spirit of compromise and a commitment to reaching an agreement by February 28, 2003. I will do the same as part of our continuing commitment to the U.N. effort to find a just and lasting settlement for Cyprus.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
