    The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of former Nevada Congressman James Bilbray.
"America is at crossroads and Senator Hillary Clinton is the only presidential candidate with the experience, intellect, and vision to lead our country in the right direction," Bilbray said. "I am confident that as president, Senator Clinton will work hard to strengthen America's position in the global economy, protect the nation from national security threats, and ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity to reach their full potential."
Congressman Bilbray is a Nevada native, and prior to being elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1987, he was a Nevada State Senator. During his four terms in the United States Congress, he was Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Taxation, Tourism and Procurement where he fought to promote and protect the economic interests of hardworking Americans. In addition, he was a member of the Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence Committee and the 2005 BRAC Commission. Congressman Bilbray currently works at the Nevada law firm Kummer, Kaempfer, Bonner, Renshaw, and Ferrario and serves as a member of the United States Postal Service Board of Governors.
"Jim's tireless efforts to promote economic opportunities for small business owners and his continued devotion to the public exemplify his dedication to Nevada and the country," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "We are honored that he will play a leading role in the campaign."
