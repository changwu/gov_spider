    Under authority of the act of Congress of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11 at 34 and 36), and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that on and after March 1, 1912, the boundaries of the Sequoia National Forest, California, as proclaimed March 2, 1909, and modified by subsequent proclamation of July 1, 1910, be further modified by excluding therefrom all that part of the Tule River Indian Reservation included in said Sequoia National Forest by said proclamation of March 2, 1909.
The purpose of this exclusion is to restore the Tule River Indian Reservation in all respects to the status existing prior to the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, as though the inclusion of the lands within the Sequoia National Forest had not been ordered, and said Indian reservation is hereby fully re-created and restored to that status.
