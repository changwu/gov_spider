    Today, I have signed S.J. Res. 57, a joint resolution "To establish a national policy on permanent papers." S.J. Res. 57 brings to public attention the fact that future generations of Americans will lose access to documents of enduring value unless we take action.
A significant portion of our intellectual and cultural legacy is rapidly disintegrating in libraries, archives, museums, historical societies, and other repositories across the country. Millions of books, serials, manuscripts, and documents are decaying because of the acidic content of their paper.
S.J. Res. 57 will help institutions and organizations responsible for these endangered materials to confront this problem by promoting the use of acid-free paper.
