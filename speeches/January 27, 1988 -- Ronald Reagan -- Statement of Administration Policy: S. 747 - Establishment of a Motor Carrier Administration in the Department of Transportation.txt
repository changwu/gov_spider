    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hollings (D) South Carolina and 26 others)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 747, which would create a separate Motor Carrier Administration within the Department of Transportation, because: (1) the administration has already upgraded the motor carrier functions within the Department and has appointed an Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers to insure that the motor carrier industry will receive a high level of attention within the Department and (2) further reorganization would be expensive, result in redundant administrative and budget operations, divert motor carrier transportation staff from importarit safety initiatives, and seriously detract from efforts to implement important motor carrier safety statutes.
The administration believes that the interests of the Nation would be better served by enacting the administration's proposal, S. 1710, which would complete the economic deregulation of the motor carrier industry.
