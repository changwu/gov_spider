    McLean, VA - Thompson for President Campaign Manager Bill Lacy today released the following statement about Mitt Romney's flailing attacks on Fred Thompson's strong record on fighting illegal immigration.
"Less than two years ago, Mitt Romney stated he would be 'delighted' to provide support to llegal immigrants who came to the U.S. 'contrary to the law.' Legal versus illegal doesn't seem to matter to Romney, as long as his current position is politically expedient. That's not leadership, that's pandering."
In 2006, Romney said he supported a path to citizenship for illegal residents . "Gov. Mitt Romney expressed support...for an immigration program that places large numbers of illegal residents on the path toward citizenship...Romney said illegal immigrants should have a chance to obtain citizenship. '...those that are here paying taxes and not taking government benefits should begin a process towards application for citizenship, as they would from their home country.'" (Evan Lehman, "Romney Supports Immigration Program, But Not Granting 'Amnesty,'" The Lowell Sun, 3/30/06)
In 2005, Romney said he would be "delighted" to provide support to illegal immigrants who wish to seek permanent legal status in the U.S. ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpUNVRNVk-E )
