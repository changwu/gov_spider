    I applaud the House and Senate for passing bipartisan legislation that provides us with additional tools to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violent crimes against our children. This legislation builds upon the steps my administration took last year to expand, enhance, and coordinate the successful Amber Alert system across the Nation. The bill also strengthens child pornography laws.
The safety and well-being of our children is a shared priority for all Americans and Federal, State, and local authorities. We must use every available resource to find and safely return missing children to their families and their homes, and we must use every available tool to vigorously prosecute and severely punish those who would do our children harm. I look forward to signing this important legislation into law as soon as possible.
