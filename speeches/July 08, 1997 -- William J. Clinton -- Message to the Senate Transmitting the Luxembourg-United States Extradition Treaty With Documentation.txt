    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, signed at Washington on October 1, 1996.
In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both countries, and thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. It will supersede, with certain noted exceptions, the Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed at Berlin on October 29, 1883, and the Supplementary Extradition Convention between the United States and Luxembourg signed at Luxembourg on April 24, 1935.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, July 8, 1997.
