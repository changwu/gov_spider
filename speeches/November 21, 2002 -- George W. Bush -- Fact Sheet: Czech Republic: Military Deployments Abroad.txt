    The Czech Republic has participated in peacekeeping operations in Southeast Europe since the beginning of the nineties as a contributing state to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Croatia. Since 1995, it has contributed forces to NATO deployments in Bosnia. The Czech Republic currently maintains a joint Czech-Slovak mechanized battalion in Kosovo and a staff of 15 officers in Bosnia.
On September 11, after NATO invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Czech Republic provided air transport to support AWACS operations in Europe as U.S. AWACS were called to support coalition forces in Afghanistan. The Czech Republic later sent 200 personnel to operate a military field hospital in Afghanistan. It deployed a nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological defense and decontamination unit (200 troops) to Kuwait in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In early 2003, the Czech Republic plans to send 120 special operations forces to Afghanistan.
