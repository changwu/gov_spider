Sanders hauled in more than $6 million on the final day of the month alone, nearly matching the amount he raised in the 24 hours after a 22-point victory in the New Hampshire primary.
"Working Americans chipping in a few dollars every week are changing the way campaigns in our country are financed," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton's personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination." 
Unlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99.9 percent of Sanders' donors can give again. In sharp contrast, Federal Election Commission reports indicate that a majority of the money given to Hillary Clinton came from donors who already have given her the maximum allowed by law.
Clinton finished the month on a fundraising tear, holding high-dollar events in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
"Our supporters are a firewall protecting Bernie from the Clinton campaign's wealthiest donors and super PACs," Weaver said. "But with the amount of high-dollar fundraisers she's held this month, it's hard to see how we possibly raised more than Secretary Clinton in February."
