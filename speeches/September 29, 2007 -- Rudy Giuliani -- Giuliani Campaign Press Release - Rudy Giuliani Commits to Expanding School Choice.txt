    In remarks today before the National Federation of Republican Women Convention in Palm Springs, California, Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke about his Commitment to provide access to a quality education to every child in America by giving real school choice to parents.
As President, Mayor Giuliani will advocate establishing a competitive grant process to fund new school voucher programs for students trapped in failing schools so American families can have real educational options for their children. He also promotes the expansion charter schools, while providing equal funding and facilities. In addition, the Mayor's plan empowers states to expand options for parents of special education students and establishes a pilot program that offers educational options to children of active-duty military personnel.
"We're going to take the decision-making and we're going to put it in the hands of the people who really know the children, really love the children, really care about the children, more than anyone else: the parents," said Mayor Giuliani.
Expanding school choice is one of Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People. The Mayor has traveled the country over the last several months unveiling his Commitments, a bold vision aimed at moving America forward.
