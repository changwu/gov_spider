    I want to express my concern for the people of Salt Lake City, who are suffering the effects of a devastating tornado that tore through their city this afternoon. I was particularly saddened to learn that the tornado left at least one person dead and dozens injured. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are already on the ground; more officials are en route; and FEMA Director James Lee Witt has talked by phone with Governor Leavitt. The burden of recovery will be heavy, but it is a burden that the people of Salt Lake City need not carry alone. As they begin the difficult process of mourning, healing, and rebuilding, our Nation stands steadfastly behind them.
