On the situation developing in Afghanistan:
Here's what's clear: The Afghan national forces still do not have the capability to control the country and fight off these insurgents. And as a result, if the numbers [of U.S. troops in the country] get too low, Afghanistan could collapse, and it could become the next Syria, the next prime operational spaceÂ for ISIS, which as you correctly pointed out is growing its presence there, obviously for the Taliban, and ultimately for al-Qaeda as well. These radical groups need operating spaces, they need vacuums, and the collapse of the Afghan government, which is what will happen without significant support from the United States, will lead to the creation of an additional vacuum in that region of the world.
