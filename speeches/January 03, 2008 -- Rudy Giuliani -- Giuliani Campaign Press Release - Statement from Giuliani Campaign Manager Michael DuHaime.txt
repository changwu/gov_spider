    Giuliani Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime made the following statement regarding the Iowa Caucuses:
"We congratulate Mike Huckabee on a hard-fought victory in Iowa. This race is wide open and we will continue to run a national primary campaign designed to win the number of delegates necessary to become the Republican nominee. Rudy is the only Republican candidate who can not only win the primary and general elections, but will turn purple states red."
