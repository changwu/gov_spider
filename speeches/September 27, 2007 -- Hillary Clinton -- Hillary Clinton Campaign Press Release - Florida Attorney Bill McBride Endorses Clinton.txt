    McBride Joins National Veterans and Military Retirees Steering Cmte.
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Florida attorney Bill McBride and named him to the campaign's National Veterans and Military Retirees Steering Committee.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to support our troops and end the war in Iraq," McBride said. "She is ready to lead from her first day in the White House."
McBride was the Democratic candidate for Governor in 2002, running a strong campaign on a platform of strengthening Florida's schools by reducing class sizes and improving teacher qualifications and salaries.
A decorated Vietnam veteran, McBride joined the Tampa-based law firm of Holland and Knight after law school, rising to become managing partner. Under his leadership, Holland and Knight grew to become the seventh-largest law firm in the country.
McBride is currently a partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa, and Chair of the Board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC.
"I'm honored to have Bill's support and counsel," Clinton said.
McBride joins other prominent veterans and military retirees supporting Hillary, including Gen. Wesley Clark, Sen. Daniel Inouye, Rep. Joe Sestak, Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, and Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick, as well as leading Floridians Reps. Alcee Hastings, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kendrick Meek and Corrine Brown.
