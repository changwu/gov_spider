    Dear Mr. Tobriner:
I am pleased to have your letter of November 7, 1963, transmitting the recommendations of the Policy Advisory Committee with respect to the North Leg of the Inner Loop and the additional Central City Potomac River Crossing, and advising me that the Board of Commissioners concurs in those recommendations.
The recommendations are likewise acceptable to me, and will be included in my budget recommendations to the Congress in January.
The Policy Advisory Committee is an example of the possibilities for cooperative action among Federal and District agencies in resolving difficult problems, and the fact that its recommendations are unanimous is particularly gratifying. The concurrence of the Board of Commissioners in those recommendations should assure that the entire District Highway Program can now move forward.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Walter N. Tobriner, President, Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.]
