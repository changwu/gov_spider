    I applaud the overwhelming majority of lawmakers from both parties who came together on behalf of America's workers to pass the "Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014." This bipartisan compromise will help workers, including workers with disabilities, access employment, education, job-driven training, and support services that give them the chance to advance their careers and secure the good jobs of the future. Today's vote helps ensure that our workers can earn the skills employers are looking for right now and that American businesses have the talent pool it takes to compete and win in our global economy. I look forward to signing it into law and hope Congress will continue to come together to make progress for America's working families.
