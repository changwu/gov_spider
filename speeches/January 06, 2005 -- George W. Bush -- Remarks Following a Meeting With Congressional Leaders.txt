    Class-Action Lawsuit Reform
I am very grateful that Members of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives, Members from both political parties, have come to discuss the need for the Congress and the administration to work together to get meaningful, real class-action lawsuit reform.
Class-action lawsuits have become a problem in the United States. The judicial system is not fair. It is unbalanced. It is tilted. And Members around this table understand that, and Members around this table are willing to set aside their political party to do what is right for worker and businessowner alike.
We had a very good discussion. It's a discussion that says to me that it is very possible that a good piece of legislation can move quickly this year out of both the Senate and the House, get it to conference quickly, and get it to my desk quickly, to show the American people that both parties are willing to work together to solve problems. We have a problem with class-action lawsuits. It is a problem that we all recognize, and it's a problem we intend to fix.
And I want to thank the Members for coming. I'm honored you are here, and I look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.
