    Today, Biden for President announced 15 hometown endorsements from elected officials within the Pennsylvania counties of Lackawanna and Luzerne, underscoring the energy surrounding the campaign in key parts of the Commonwealth that went to Trump in the 2016 election and furthermore solidifying his standing as the candidate that will make Trump a one term president.
"Pennsylvania is a critical state in this election and this slate of endorsements brings the campaign closer to the broad coalition we are building. These endorsements demonstrate support from Vice President Biden's hometown and key counties Democrats will need to compete in next November," said Greg Schultz, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "To have support from these dedicated public servants reflects the grassroots momentum that is continuing to move this campaign forward."
