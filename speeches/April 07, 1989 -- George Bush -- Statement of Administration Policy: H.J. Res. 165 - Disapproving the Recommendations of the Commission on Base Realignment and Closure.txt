    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Brown (D) California and 12 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 165 and urges Congress to continue its support of the bipartisan approach on base realignments and closures pursuant to Public Law 100-526. By allowing the Commission's recommendations to go into effect, national defense will be improved and costs reduced through a more efficient military base structure. Moreover, unneeded federal land will be restored and out to productive private or public use.
