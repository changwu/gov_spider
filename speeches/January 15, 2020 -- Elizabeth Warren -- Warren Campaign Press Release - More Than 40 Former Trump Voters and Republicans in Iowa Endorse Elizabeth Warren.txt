    West Des Moines, IA—More than 40 current or former Republicans—including Iowans who voted for Trump in the last election and a 2016 Iowa caucus precinct captain for Ted Cruz—have endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president. The list includes 16 Iowans who will have precinct leadership roles for the Warren campaign on caucus night.
"Elizabeth Warren is building a coalition that will win this November because she's fighting to level the playing field for all working families," said Judy Haynes, a former Republican from Manchester, Iowa. "She's fighting to end corruption in Washington so our government works for the American people—not just the wealthy and well-connected. This former Republican is caucusing for Elizabeth on Feb. 3rd because I want to live in the America she knows is possible."
Elizabeth Warren is running for president to end corruption and ensure opportunity for all. Her plans start with a wealth tax—a small tax on the fortunes of the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans. The plan enjoys support from across the political spectrum, and would generate revenue we can use to provide universal child care and pre-K, high-quality public K-12 for every student, universal free public college and technical school, student-loan debt cancellation for 42 million Americans and more.
"Republicans, Democrats and independents alike can see that government today works great for those at the top, while leaving everyone else behind," Elizabeth Warren said. "I'm grateful to see Iowans from across the political spectrum joining our movement—together, we can make the big, structural change we need."
The below list is comprised of current and former Republicans and Trump voters who have committed to caucus for Elizabeth on Feb. 3:
