    Norman Mineta has served America with integrity, dedication, and distinction. He leaves his position as the longest serving Secretary of Transportation in our Nation's history.
Norm's life is a story of determination, courage, and service. As a child, he lived in an internment camp. As a young man, he wore his country's uniform in Korea and Japan. From there, he went on to become a mayor, a Congressman, and a Cabinet Secretary under two Presidents.
As my Secretary of Transportation, Norm performed a crucial role on September 11, 2001, leading the successful effort to bring tens of thousands of passengers aboard commercial aircraft to safe landings. His leadership was vital to strengthening the security of America's seaports and airports. Norm worked hard to help eliminate red tape and liberalize the commercial aviation market. After Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team were able to rapidly repair and reopen the region's major highways, airports, seaports, and pipelines. He also oversaw important changes in fuel economy standards that will save fuel, save lives, and save jobs.
Norm is an inspiration to all of us and has earned the admiration of a grateful Nation. I am honored that he agreed to serve in my Cabinet. Laura and I wish Norm, Deni, and their children all the best.
