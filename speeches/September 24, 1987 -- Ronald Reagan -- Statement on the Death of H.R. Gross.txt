    H.R. Gross was a dedicated and hardworking public servant. Referred to as "the conscience of the House," he .met his responsibilities with care, wisdom, and oldfashioned common sense. He did his homework and earned the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As a Representative, he sought to do what was best for his constituents and always thought long and hard about spending taxpayers' money.
Before coming to Washington, he was a journalist in Iowa, where we worked together at radio station WHO in Des Moines. I have many fond memories of H.R. Gross, and Nancy joins me in extending our deep sympathy to Hazel and their family.
