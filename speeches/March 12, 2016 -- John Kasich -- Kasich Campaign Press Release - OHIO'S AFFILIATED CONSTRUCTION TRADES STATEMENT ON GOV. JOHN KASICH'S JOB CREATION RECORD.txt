    Because of John Kasich, Ohio's construction workers have more jobs, which create opportunities for a higher quality of life for their families. While others choose to utilize foreign workers for purposes of convenience or profit, Governor Kasich has successfully brought jobs to Ohio from Mexico, China and Europe, and he has been steadfast in his demands for Ohio's construction workforce. We need a president who walks the walk, and John Kasich has done that with us.
"His relentless approach to economic development and job creation, coupled with his unprecedented efforts to rebuild Ohio's infrastructure, has created numerous opportunities for our contractor-partners and our 92,000+ members in the construction trades. I am confident that he'll be a strong president for all Americans and implement the same level-headed common sense economic policies in the White House that he has done so powerfully as Governor of Ohio. We will continue to stress to our members that there is one clear leader in the Republican field â€” Governor John Kasich.

-Matt Szollosi, Executive Director of Ohio's Affiliated Construction Trades
