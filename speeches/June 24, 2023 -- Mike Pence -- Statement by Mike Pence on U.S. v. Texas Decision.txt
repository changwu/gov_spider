    Mike Pence issued the following statement after the Supreme Court issued their decision in US v. Texas:
"Texas and Louisiana are doing everything they can to enforce security at our southern border despite the crisis caused by the Biden Administration's egregious failure to faithfully execute our immigration laws. As your next President, defending the Constitution of the United States means defending our national sovereignty, and that begins with securing our southern border."
