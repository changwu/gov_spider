    Leaders From Across The Country Will Guide Campaign Outreach Efforts
Hillary Clinton today announced the formation of the campaign's National Hispanic Leadership Council and named its Executive Committee, demonstrating her growing support among the Hispanic community. Clinton made the announcement in Orlando, Florida, where she is participating in a Presidential Forum during the 24th Annual Conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO).
The Executive Committee, comprised of national and local leaders from across the country, will serve as an advisory board for the campaign on issues important to the Latino community and will play an active role reaching out and organizing Hispanics in their communities and across the country.
"The support for Hillary Clinton in the Latino community continues to grow," said Raul Yzaguirre, Campaign Co-Chair and Chair of Hispanic Outreach efforts. "I first met Hillary Clinton when she was registering voters in South Texas, and her commitment to public service continues today. Whether it's fighting for universal health care, making college more accessible or creating better job opportunities, her record on issues important to Latinos speaks for itself. I am proud to support Hillary, and to be joined by such a strong group of leaders working on her behalf."
"I support Hillary Clinton because she is the candidate that will help create opportunities to empower our communities across America," said New York Congresswoman Nydia VelÃ¡zquez. "Hillary has consistently supported proposals that help strengthen the middle class and working families. In New York, I have witnessed her work to launch economic development initiatives to provide critical resources to small and micro businesses and helped launch a private sector initiative called New Jobs for New York that makes venture capital available to New York's innovators, many of whom are Latinos."
"I am proud to support Hillary Clinton for President," said Florida State Rep. Luis GarcÃ­a. "As a life-long firefighter and former Fire Chief, I know the true meaning of public service and Hillary embodies that concept. Our country is ready for her strong leadership that will take our country in a new direction."
"I am honored to be joined by so many leaders that have dedicated their lives to advocating for better education for our children, access to health care, civil and voting rights and advancing economic opportunities not only for Latinos, but for all Americans," Clinton said. "With their support, we will continue taking our message of change across the country."
A USA Today/Gallup poll released this week found that among Hispanic voters, Hillary Clinton leads the primary field by 46 points. Hillary Clinton has fought for many issues important to the Latino community, including education, health care, economic opportunities and a fair and humane immigration reform.
