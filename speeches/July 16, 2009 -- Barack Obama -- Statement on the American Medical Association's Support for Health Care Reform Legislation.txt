    I am grateful that the doctors of the AMA have chosen to support health insurance reform that will lower costs, expand coverage, and assure choice and quality health care for all Americans. Along with the Nation's nurses, these doctors are joining the chorus of Americans who know that the time to reform what is broken about our health care system is now.
