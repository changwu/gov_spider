    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President: )
In accordance with Section 203(b) (2) of the Trade Act of 1974, enclosed is a report to the Congress setting forth my determination that import relief for the U.S. Artificial Bait and Flies Industry is not in the national economic interest and explaining the reasons for my decision.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
IMPORT RELIEF—ARTIFICIAL BAITS AND FLIES
As required under Section 203(b)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, I am transmitting this report to Congress setting forth my decision with respect to artificial baits and flies covered by the affirmative finding on September 21, 1978, of the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) under Section 201(d)(1) of the Trade Act. As I have determined not to provide import relief, I have included the reasons for my decision.
I have determined that the import relief is not in the national economic interest for the following reasons:
1. Because of the existing large difference in prices between imports and like or similar domestically produced artificial baits and flies the import relief recommended by the USITC would not be effective. Domestically made items sell for an average of $6-$7 per dozen. Imports sell for an average of $2-$3 per dozen. Moreover, the level of imports has barely changed over the five years—5.0 million dozen were imported in 1974 and 5.1 million dozen were imported in 1977 even though, in the interim, import prices dropped 30 percent and domestic prices nearly doubled.
2. Latest (January-April 1978) economic indicators for this industry. show an improved market situation. Compared to a similar period last year, domestic shipments are up 1 percent in value, 6 percent in quantity, employment increased 12 percent and the number of hours worked are up 50 percent. Finally, the domestic industry's share of the domestic market has improved.
