    Hillary and I were very saddened to learn of the tragic death of my friend Governor Mel Carnahan, his son Randy, and his aide Chris Sifford. Mel devoted his life to his family, his State, and our Nation. Whether in the Air Force or the State legislature, as Lieutenant Governor or Governor, he always put the highest priority on serving others.
In his last campaign, Mel Carnahan, as always, gave everything he had for what he believed in. He loved politics and public service, and his extraordinary record proved they can be noble endeavors. For many years now, I have been proud to call Mel Carnahan my partner, and prouder still to call him my friend.
Hillary and I send our deepest condolences to his wonderful wife, Jean, to Russ, Robin, Tom, and the rest of his family, to the other families whose loved ones perished, and to the people of Missouri, whom he loved so much and served so well.
