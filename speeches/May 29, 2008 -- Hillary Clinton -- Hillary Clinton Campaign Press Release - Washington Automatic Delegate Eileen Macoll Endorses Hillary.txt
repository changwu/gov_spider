    Washington Automatic Delegate Eileen Macoll announced her support for Hillary Clinton today. Macoll is vice chair of the Washington State Democratic Party.
"I'm taking this step today because I have been inspired by Hillary's bold commitment to solving our nation's toughest challenges," Macoll said. "On the issues that matter most-from establishing universal health care to improving our schools to ending the war in Iraq-she has never backed down and never wavered. Hillary has what it takes to beat John McCain this Fall and win back the White House.
"Hillary has a plan to bring an honorable end to the war in Iraq, and I know that Senator she and Senator Murray will ensure that our troops receive the care we should be proud to provide as they return home."
Senator Patty Murray welcomed Macoll's endorsement today. "Eileen has been a tireless advocate for the Washington State party, and I look forward to working with her to spread Hillary's message of change in the weeks ahead."
