    On this, the second Labor Day of my Administration, more Americans hold jobs than at any time in our Nation's history. Unemployment has been dramatically slashed. Our workers are earning more and producing more than ever beforeâ€”last month, the Gross National Product passed the milestone two trillion dollar mark. Though inflation is a major concern, we are working hard to combat it and, overall, the economic picture bodes well for American citizens.
Our free market system continues to provide broad social and economic protections while maintaining respect for individual dignity and freedom of choice in the work place, as well as in the market place. Our Nation offers a working environment in which we can take pride, and the opportunity for skilled craftsmen to take pleasure in their continuing achievements.
Working Americans have good cause to celebrate this Labor Day. In the last 12 months, more jobs have been added to the economy than in any year in history. Almost a quarter of those who were unemployed when I took office are productively employed today. We have worked hard on this problem and the results are gratifying: we have brought unemployment down to the lowest level in three years, and we have done it in a peaceful, growing economy, without war or recession.
Working Americans can also take pride in the continuing effectiveness of our strong, free labor organizations. We have a vocal, articulate work force in this Nation, and an ever-better standard of living for an ever-rising percentage of our people.
We still have problems; we still have much to do. But it is good to pause and count our blessings too. We have a great deal to be thankful for on this Labor Day.
