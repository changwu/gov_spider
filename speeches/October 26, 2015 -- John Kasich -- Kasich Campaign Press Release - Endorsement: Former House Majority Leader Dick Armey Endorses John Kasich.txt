"I've known and worked with John Kasich for 30 years and have always respected him for being motivated solely by his concern for our country. He's a leader who gets things done, works well with others and brings people together, stays focused on the needs of the country and is never distracted by some personal political ambition. This is why I'm so excited to endorse John Kasich," said Armey.
Armey is an economist and former university professor who was elected to Congress nine times from north Texas. He was an architect of the Contract with America and 1994 Republican revolution, and was elected to the position of House Majority Leader by his fellow Republicans. Respected for his conservative approach to fiscal policy and straight-forward manner, Armey's legacy of advocacy for conservative ideas continues to shape Republican thought to this day.
"Dick was a great Leader and partner and helped us clear so many hurdles by simply standing strong and calling it like it was. His support means so much to me because he's someone I respect for his integrity and his intellect. I'm grateful to have him on our team and am excited about what we're going to be able get done together," Governor Kasich said.
