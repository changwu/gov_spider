    President Hu. I am very happy to have talks with you, Mr. President. This is your first state visit to this country. To begin with, please allow me to extend on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people and in my own name, a warm welcome to youâ€”welcome to China.
Mr. President, you attach importance to China and you have also worked actively to promote the further growth of this relationship. You have underlined that you welcome a strong, prosperous, and successful China that plays a even greater role on the world stage.
I very much appreciate your statements. I'm willing to have a in-depth exchange of views with you, Mr. President, on how to further the China-U.S. relationship and on how to step up our cooperation in regional and international affairs.
Mr. President, as you are our distinguished guest who have traveled from afar, I would like to give the microphone to you first.
President Obama. Well, Mr. President, let me say on behalf of the American people, my delegation, as well as myself, we are very grateful for your hospitality. We have very much enjoyed our visit in China so far. As you indicated, the United States believes that a strong U.S.-China partnership and dialogue is important not only for the well being and prosperity of our two nations, but also of the world.
And I believe that in these conversations today and in the future, we can continue to build on the progress that's been made over the last three decades and that the United States and China can work on a whole range of global issues, including climate change, making sure that we have economic growth and prosperity, and ensuring that together we are bringing about a more peaceful world.
