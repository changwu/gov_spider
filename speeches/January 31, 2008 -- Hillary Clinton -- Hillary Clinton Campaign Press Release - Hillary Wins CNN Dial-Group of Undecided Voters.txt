    CNN's Erica Hill - Hillary wins CNN dial-group of undecided voters. Erica Hill: "Going in Anderson, our group was pretty, in fact, was equally split between the two candidates. Coming out, by 60-40, so just a little bit of an uptick, supporters for Sen. Clinton. 60% of our voters, our undecided voters say they feel that she performed the best and they would vote for her."

CNN's Bill Bennett - 'It's a victory for Hillary Clinton... I don't think [Obama] had enough.' "Frankly, I think it was a little disappointing, from my perspective. I think Barack Obama had to do more than he did. I thought she won - I'll just be crude and say she won the debate - I thought she was in control... He's the challenger. He's an athlete, he should know that he had to work a little harder. He was civil, he was very good on his details, I don't think he really challenged her. And I think that's going to be a problem. I think it's a victory for Hillary Clinton. Super Tuesday's coming up, I don't think he had enough." [CNN, 1/31/08]
Washington Post's Chris Cillizza - Hillary 'face the tougher questions tonight... handled them with aplomb.' "Give Clinton credit. She has faced the tougher questions tonight and has generally handled them with aplomb." [Washington Post's The Fix, 1/31/08]
