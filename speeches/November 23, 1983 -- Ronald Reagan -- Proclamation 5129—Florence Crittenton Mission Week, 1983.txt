  A Proclamation

This year marks one hundred years of outstanding public service to young women by the Florence Crittenton Mission organization. In 1883, Charles Nelson Crittenton of New York opened his first mission which, in the words of its original Congressional charter, was to assist troubled young women to "seek reformation of character... (and) to reach positions of honorable self-support" and thereby make a new start in life.
The Florence Crittenton Mission today has grown to a network of 39 agencies in 26 States. It has achieved distinction in providing a wide range of services to young women, from residential care to career counseling.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 383, has designated the week beginning November 6, 1983 as "Florence Crittenton Mission Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 6, 1983, as Florence Crittenton Mission Week.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
