Revised 3:30 6/18/85(Senate)(Weicker (R) Connecticut and 34 others)
The Administration supports S. 408 as amended by the Weicker amendment (255) thus conforming S. 408 with the Senate's First Budget Resolution for FY 86.
In addition, the Administration strongly opposes a Bumpers amendment that would allow farmers to be eligible for disaster assistance. Disaster assistance is already available through the Farmers Home Administration.
