In the ad, Cruz notes that President Obama stands for his principles, and just the same, Republicans need to stand up for their principles, like defending the Constitution, securing the border, and respecting the rule of law.

Ad Script:
Cruz for President
"First Principles"
:30 TV
CRUZ: Barack Obama sticks by his principles.
It's time for Republicans to stand by ours – that's how we win.
And that's how I'll lead.
As president, I won't compromise the values that make us who we are.
The Constitution wasn't a first draft.
Our border isn't a revolving door.
And the rule of law wasn't meant to be broken.
America is off track. But our founding principles will get us back.
I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message.
