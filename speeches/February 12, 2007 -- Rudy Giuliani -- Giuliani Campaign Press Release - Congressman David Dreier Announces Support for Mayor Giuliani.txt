    In a sign of continuing momentum, the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee today announced Congressman David Dreier, Chairman of the California Republican Congressional Delegation and House Rules Committee Ranking Republican, has announced his support for Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be the next President of the United States. Dreier's endorsement follows the rousing reception Mayor Giuliani received at the California State Republican Convention and his successful swing through the state. Dreier will help lead Mayor Giuliani's exploratory committee efforts in California.
Congressman Dreier said, "America needs the proven leadership of Rudy Giuliani to tackle the difficult challenges our country is facing. Not only does Mayor Giuliani have a record of results, he has a positive, optimistic vision that can unite our Party and our country for the greater good.
"I am proud to be supporting Mayor Rudy Giuliani for President and am looking forward to helping the exploratory committee's efforts in any way I can," concluded Dreier.
Mayor Rudy Giuliani welcomed the support from Congressmen Dreier. "I'm excited to have a Republican leader like Congressman Dreier on our team." This endorsement comes on the heels of Congressman Pete Sessions and former Congresswoman Susan Molinari joining Team Rudy, as well as the previously announced support of California Congressman Devin Nunes and Congresswoman Mary Bono. More California endorsements will be announced later in the week.
