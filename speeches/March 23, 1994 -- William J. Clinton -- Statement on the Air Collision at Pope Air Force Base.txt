    I am deeply saddened to learn of the tragic air collision at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina and the resultant loss of life and injuries. Hillary and I join all Americans in expressing our condolences to the families and friends of those killed and wish a speedy recovery to those injured. This tragedy is a reminder that all those who serve in the military at home and abroad put their lives at risk in the service of their Nation and deserve the thanks of all Americans for doing so.
