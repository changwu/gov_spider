    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Pennsylvania Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz.
"Given her depth and breadth of experience, it's clear that Hillary Clinton can lead this nation in a new direction and restore America's image abroad," Rep. Schwartz said. "She is the most qualified candidate in the field and I'm proud to support her."
A State Senator for 14 years before her election to Congress in 2004, Schwartz led the effort to create the Pennsylvania State Children's Health Insurance Program, which later served as a national model for a state/federal/family partnership to increase the number of children with health insurance. As the Democratic Chair of the Senate Education Committee, Schwartz successfully fought for increased accountability in Philadelphia public schools.
"Congresswoman Schwartz is a leader on health care and education issues, and I'm honored to have her support," Senator Clinton said.
