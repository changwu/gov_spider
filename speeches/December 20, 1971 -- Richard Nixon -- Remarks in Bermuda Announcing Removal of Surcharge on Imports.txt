    Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have just had my first meeting with the Prime Minister. He felt that it would be well that I make this announcement prior to the time that we go into our more extended meetings this afternoon.
I have today made the first decision implementing the agreement which was reached over the weekend by the Group of Ten in their meetings in Washington. After consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State today, I have signed a proclamation [4098] removing the 10 percent surcharge.
This first step having been taken, we can now move on to the trade areas and the monetary areas in which agreement was also reached over the weekend.
Later today, on the American side, Secretary Connally and Secretary Rogers will brief the press, and on the British side I know arrangements will probably be made for proper briefings also.
Thank you very much.
