    Barbara and I are deeply saddened by the death of our longtime family friend and leader of the Republican Party, Meade Alcorn. Meade was chairman of the Republican Party in the late 1950's and was an inspiration to all who were formulating political careers during the time of his leadership. He was a practitioner and a believer who gave the party ideals and strength through its national organization.
Meade was a personal friend of my father and our entire family. He gave us support and advice at many points in our lives. I spoke with his wonderful wife, Marcia, this afternoon to offer our sympathy and condolences. Barbara and I offer our prayers for Meade Alcorn.
