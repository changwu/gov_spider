'All that's swirling around us now is Impeachment. We talk about it day and night it's what's on the news there is NOTHING that has turned up that is Impeachable.

The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which in the name of transparency I immediately released to Congress & the public.

Very simple! I was looking for Corruption and also why Germany France and others in the European Union don't do more for Ukraine.
