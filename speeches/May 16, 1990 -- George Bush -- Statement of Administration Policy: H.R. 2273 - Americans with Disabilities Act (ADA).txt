    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised)
(House)(Hoyer (D) MD and 19 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2273. However, the Administration strongly urges that the bill be amended to include the specific employment discrimination remedies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, rather than to incorporate those remedies by reference.
A very important component of the agreement the Administration reached with the Senate was that the remedies under the employment title would be those specified in the current version of Title VII and that the ADA would not make available compensatory and punitive damages. The Kennedy-Hawkins legislation currently before the Congress, however, would modify Title VII to allow compensatory and punitive damages, and cross-reference would automatically make them available under ADA as well. Accordingly, the Administration believes the cross-reference should be replaced with language specifying the remedies in order to carry out the agreement. Because the Sensenbrenner amendment replaces the cross-reference with specific remedies, the Administration supports the adoption of the Sensenbrenner amendment.
