    McLean, VA - Presidential candidate Fred Thompson announced several prominent additions to his Iowa campaign today, as part of his three-day bus tour through the first-in-the-nation state.
Robert J. Haus, a longtime conservative activist and veteran of several political campaigns, will serve as Thompson's Executive Director in Iowa. He will oversee Thompson's Iowa operation and will assist the campaign with Iowa media strategy.
Haus is joined by Andrew Dorr, a talented and experienced political and grassroots operative who will lead Thompson's efforts in Iowa as the campaign's Midwest Political Director. Dorr has extensive Iowa campaign experience, having served as Deputy Coalitions' Director in Iowa for George Bush in 2000, Midwest Coalitions' Director for Bush-Cheney '04, and Political Director for Jim Nussle's 2006 gubernatorial campaign. Dorr will oversee the political and grassroots operations in 11 Midwestern states, including Iowa.
"Andrew Dorr and Robert Haus bring tremendous political and grassroots experience to Fred Thompson's Iowa organization," said Thompson's National Political Director Randy Enwright. "The addition of these valuable and experienced Iowa political organizers makes it clear that Fred Thompson fields an impressive and emerging grassroots operation in Iowa."
Also joining the campaign's Iowa organization are Kristen Fuzer, Scott Will, and Laura Mommsen.
Fuzer brings strong grassroots experience, serving as both the Central Iowa Field Director and Organizational Director for the Republican Party of Iowa. Fuzer will serve as Caucus Organization Director for the Fred Thompson campaign.
Scott Will served as a field staffer for Jeff Lamberti's 2006 congressional campaign, and Laura Mommsen worked for Jim Nussel's 2006 gubernatorial campaign. Both Will and Mommsen will serve as field staff for Thompson's Iowa organization.
