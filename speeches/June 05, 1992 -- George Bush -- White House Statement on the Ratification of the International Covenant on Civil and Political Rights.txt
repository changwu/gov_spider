    The President has signed the United States instrument of ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A United Nations treaty, the Covenant articulates the principles inherent in a democracy, including freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, equal protection under the law, and the right to liberty and security.
By ratifying the Covenant, the United States is underscoring its commitment to these principles at home and abroad. We hope that our ratification of the Covenant will contribute to the fostering of democracy and human rights throughout the world.
