    Beaulieu, An Assistant House Majority Leader, Is Latest Member of State Democratic Leadership to Get Behind Harris
Following Wednesday night's debate, State Representative and an Assistant House Majority Leader Jane Beaulieu is announcing her endorsement of Harris. Beaulieu, a seven-term state representative, is an influential leader in Manchester politics.
"As a longtime New Hampshire legislator, I know first hand the issues impacting Granite Staters and keeping them up at night. Kamala has clear-eyed, pragmatic solutions to many of these problems, including her plan to give the middle class a needed tax break, ensure quality and affordable healthcare for all, to make our drinking water safe from PFOA chemicals, and to protect our nation's precious natural resources," said State Representative and an Assistant House Majority Leader Jane Beaulieu. "I'm also confident that Kamala's passion, toughness, and optimism are not only what our country needs right now -- but what our party needs to defeat Donald Trump. I'm proud to endorse Kamala in her campaign for president."
Beaulieu joins former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Joe Keefe, State Representatives Dick Ames, Patty Cornell, and Linda Tanner, former Dover Mayors Jack Buckley and William Boc, Co-Chair of the NHDP Senior Caucus Pam Jorgensen, and former State Rep. Lisa DiMartino in endorsing Harris.
Cornell and Tanner, Assistant Majority Floor Leaders, are also both members of State House of Representative leadership.
