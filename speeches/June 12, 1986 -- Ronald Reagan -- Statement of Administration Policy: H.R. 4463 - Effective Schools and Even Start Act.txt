    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hawkins (D) CA and 21 others)
The Administration supports the goals of H.R. 4463, but opposes its enactment because the proposed programs duplicate ongoing successful programs and would divert needed resources from existing programs. In addition, it is inappropriate to authorize new categorical programs in a time of extreme budget restraint.
