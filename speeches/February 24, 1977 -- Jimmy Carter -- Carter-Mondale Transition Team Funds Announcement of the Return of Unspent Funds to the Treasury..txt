    The President announced today that approximately $350,000 of the $2 million appropriated to the Carter-Mondale transition team was not spent and will be returned to the Treasury.
The President said, "I'm very pleased with the work the transition team did and the fact that they were able to do it substantially under the budget allotted to them. I'm glad they were able to do their work in an economical fashion so that we're able to return this money to the Treasury."
The President's remarks followed a report to him by Jack Watson, who was the Carter-Mondale transition director. The report showed expenditures of approximately $1.65 million. The exact figure must await a final audit report.
