    Today, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I am proud to endorse Joe Biden because he is the candidate who can bring our country back together again and get things done. Maryland working families know that strong communities are built on opportunity, mutual respect and the promise of a thriving middle class. They strive every day for a better future for themselves and their loved ones. They deserve results, not more tough talk or empty promises. We need a president who works as hard as Marylanders do because they know who they are and where they come from, and that doesn't just offer promises -- but delivers a better future for our country. That person is Joe Biden."
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
