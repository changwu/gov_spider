    Well, first of all, let me say that we're very delighted to have all of you here tonight. We've got a 1-day winning streak in the House— [laughter] —so we decided not to cancel the party tonight. We made everybody check their political speeches at the gate, so there's not going to be anything tonight except good times, good music, good dancing, good food, good friendship. We're very delighted that you would bring your families with you. This is a very fine annual occasion for us. We hope to see you many more years here on the same South Grounds. Thank you very much, have a good time.
Rosalynn said she'll dance with me, so we'll lead it off, and the rest of you join in with us.
