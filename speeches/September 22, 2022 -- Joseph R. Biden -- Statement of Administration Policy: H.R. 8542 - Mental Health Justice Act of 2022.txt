    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Katie Porter, D-CA)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 8542, the Mental Health Justice Act of 2022.
Our Nation faces an unprecedented mental health and substance use crisis among people of all ages, one that has been exacerbated by the pandemic and disproportionately affects our young people. At the same time, in too many communities, jails and correctional facilities have become the largest provider of mental health care - and the police are too often asked to respond to situations that should be addressed by a health care provider or social worker. To build a behavioral health care system that works for all Americans, and especially those experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis, it is essential that we expand access to safe and appropriate community-based care, while investing in robust crisis response services.
The Mental Health Justice Act of 2022 authorizes $250 million in funding and technical assistance to States, Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations, and local governments to hire, employ, train, and dispatch mental health professionals to respond in lieu of law enforcement officers to situations involving a person experiencing a mental health or substance use disorder crisis.
The Administration urges the House to pass swiftly the Mental Health Justice Act of 2022, and looks forward to working with Congress on this important legislation.
