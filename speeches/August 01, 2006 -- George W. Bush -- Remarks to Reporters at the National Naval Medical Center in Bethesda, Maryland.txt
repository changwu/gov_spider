    The President. I'm just amazed at the health care here at Bethesda. The Admiral runs an amazing operation. And it's really important for our citizens to know that if one of our men and women get hurt on the battlefield, they're going to get incredibly good health care.
And, Admiral, I can't thank you and your staff enough for serving the country with great dignity and class.
Rear Adm. Robinson. Thank you very much.
The President. Appreciate being here. God bless. Thank you.
I'm doing fine; my health is fine. I probably ate too many birthday cakes.
