    Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy
Subject: Determination on Extending the Agreement for Cooperation Between the United States of America and the Republic of Indonesia Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
I have considered the proposed agreement to extend for a period of 10 years the Agreement for Cooperation Between the United States of America and the Republic of Indonesia Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, signed at Washington June 30, 1980, along with the views, recommendations, and statements of the interested agencies.
I have determined that the performance of the agreement for an additional period of 10 years will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153 (b)), I hereby approve the proposed agreement on extension and authorize its execution.
George Bush
