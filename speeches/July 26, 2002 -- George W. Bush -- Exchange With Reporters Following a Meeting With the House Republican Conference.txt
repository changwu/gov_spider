Q. How are you doing, Mr. President?
Q. Would you talk for a moment, please, sir?
Q. Mr. President, what did you tell the conference today?
The President. You know, it's been an amazing week. A lot has gotten done here in the Congress, and I want to thank both the Republicans and Democrats. I think— I know the American people expect their elected Representatives to work together to get some things done, get the homeland security bill. We're even going to get trade promotion authority, which will be good for jobs and American workers. We've got a corporate responsibility bill. It's a good piece of legislation, overwhelmingly supported by both Republicans and Democrats.
The American people saw last week that this administration and the Justice Department will track down those—prosecute those CEOs who break the law. We're making good progress here. I want to thank the Members of the House; I talked to them about how pleased I am with the progress we're making.
Q. What about prescription drugs on the Senate side, sir?
The President. Well, we'll see what comes out. [Inaudible]—prescription drugs and Medicare. I've said that since I became the President, and we'll see what happens.
Right now I'm focused on the trade vote. We're going to get a free trade agreement, which is very important for jobs and workers, very important for our farmers and ranchers, and it's very important for our economy. We're going to get a good homeland security bill. And as you know, we've got a good corporate responsibility in a bipartisan bill.
So a lot has taken place here, and I'm real proud of the Members of both parties.
