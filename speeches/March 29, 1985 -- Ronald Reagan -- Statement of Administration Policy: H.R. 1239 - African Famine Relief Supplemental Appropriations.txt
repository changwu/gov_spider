    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
The Administration does not oppose the conference version of H.R. 1239. However, the Administration is concerned that the conference bill would provide resources substantially in excess of its estimate of need. As required in Title III of the bill, the Administration will ensure that no funds are obligated that cannot be used effectively.
