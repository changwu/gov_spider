LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted a remarkable 3,000-plus supporters and undecided voters to his Texas A&M town hall meeting tonight. It was the first of three events showcasing Dr. Paul's characteristic large crowds that the Congressman is holding in his home state this week.
Event organizers noted that the university speaking venue was filled to capacity, necessitating an additional 500-plus to watch the speech via live feed in the lobby.
Dr. Paul's town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. CST at Texas A&M University's
Rudder Auditorium — Rudder Theatre Complex, located at the intersection of Joe Routt Boulevard and Throckmorton Street in College Station, TX 77840.
At the event, the 12-term Congressman from the Lone Star State's 14th District spoke about his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the link between civil and economic liberties, and elements of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' a fiscal blueprint designed to launch America out of its economic doldrums.
