    This is my Cabinet. And we're going to be discussing the impacts, potentially, of the shutdown and how all these various agencies will be managing to make sure the core essential functions continue, but also, obviously, to help try to manage what's going to be a very difficult potential situation for the employees of all these agencies, who are doing outstanding and very difficult work all across the country.
So I appreciate all the members of the Cabinet who are here. They have been doing a lot of planning. I wish they were spending more time focusing on how to grow jobs and the economy as opposed to having to spend time figuring out how they manage a Government shutdown. But as always, they're prepared. And we'll be getting a full briefing from the entire crew during the course of this meeting.
Thank you very much, everybody.
