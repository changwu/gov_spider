WH in-town pool report #15/ POTUS on government shutdown
During his remarks POTUS addressed the prospect of a government shutdown. He said:
"Just a few months ago after a long negotiation between myself and the new Speaker of the House we agreed on spending levels for the government that will fund essential domestic and national security priorities while still cutting the deficit by over $1 trillion over the next decade.
"Now a small group of extreme Republicans don't want to live up to the deal so now everyone in America could be forced to pay the price.
"Let's be clear. If the government shuts down that means members of the U.S. military are going to have to continue to work but not get paid. A government shutdown could impact everything from food safety to cancer research to Head Start programs for children.
"Funding the government is one of the most basic responsibilities of Congress. It's time for Republicans to start doing the job America elected them to do. Let's get this done."
Remarks are ongoing. Live stream here:

WH in-town pool report #16/ POTUS finishes
POTUS told how the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville prompted him to seek election. "I chose to run because silence is complicity and I would not be silent."
He noted that he is running again. "A lot of people focus on my age. Well, I get it. Believe me, I know better than anyone."
POTUS went on to say he "knew what to do" when the nation was flat on its back: vaccinations, rebuilding Nato and more.
POTUS's voice rose loudly as he said: "Political violence in America is never, never, never acceptable in our democracy." He criticised Donald Trump and Maga by name for seeking power at all costs.
He finished speaking at 9.49pm.
