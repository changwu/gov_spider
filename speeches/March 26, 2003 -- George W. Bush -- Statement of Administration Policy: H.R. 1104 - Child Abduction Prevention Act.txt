    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Sensenbrenner (R) Wisconsin and 16 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1104. The bill would greatly strengthen law enforcement's ability to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violent crimes committed against children.
H.R. 1104 would codify the Administration's ongoing efforts to support AMBER Alert programs by providing for national coordination of state and local AMBER Alert programs and by establishing Federal grant programs for states to support AMBER Alert communication systems and plans. The Administration urges Congress to act quickly on this legislation.
