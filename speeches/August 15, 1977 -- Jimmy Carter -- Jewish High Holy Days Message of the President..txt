    Rosalynn and I extend warmest greetings to our fellow Americans of the Jewish Faith on the occasion of your High Holy Days, in which symbolically "mankind passes in judgment before the heavenly throne".
As you solemnly review and judge your own conduct during the past year, we are all reminded that we serve God most faithfully by showing concern for our friends and neighbors.
In a world made small by modem technology, all peoples and nations have become closer together, and the concern for others has become more important than ever. This is the wellspring of our nation's commitment to human rights, and it is why we are determined that all of America's words and deeds will honor that commitment.
Among the Rosh Hashonah prayers recited in the synagogue is one which looks toward the day when mankind will be joined in universal brotherhood. This is a prayer to which all of us add our heartfelt Amen as we wish each of you a happy and prosperous New Year.
JIMMY CARTER
