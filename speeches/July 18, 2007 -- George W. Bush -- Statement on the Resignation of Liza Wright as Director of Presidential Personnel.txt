    Liza Wright has served as a valuable member of my team for over 4 1/2 years. As Assistant to the President and Director of Presidential Personnel, she has been responsible for recruiting thousands of talented people to serve throughout the Federal Government. I value her judgment and appreciate her commitment to ensuring that we have the right individuals in place to serve the American people. Laura and I wish Liza, Karl, and their two daughters all the best.
