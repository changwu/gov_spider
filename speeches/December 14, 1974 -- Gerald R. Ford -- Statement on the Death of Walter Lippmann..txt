    WITH the death of Walter Lippmann, we have lost a great American. As a newsman, political analyst, and author, Walter Lippmann played a major role for more than half a century in the development of public dialog and in shaping a new standard of journalism.
Mr. Lippmann's contributions to the good society which he envisioned for his country will long be remembered.
