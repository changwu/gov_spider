    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Coleman (D) Texas and Rep. Wilson (D) Texas)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 318 because rather than permanently locking in the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo's current tribal membership criteria as the basis for eligibility for Federal Indian program benefits, as the administration had previously requested, the bill would allow eligibility for Federal benefits to be based on whatever membership,criteria the tribe adopts beginning 10 years from now, thus requiring the provision of Federal services to an indeterminate number of tribal members. Since the Pueblo has not had to undergo the standard Federal acknowledgement process for Indian tribes, such open-ended eligibility is unwarranted.
