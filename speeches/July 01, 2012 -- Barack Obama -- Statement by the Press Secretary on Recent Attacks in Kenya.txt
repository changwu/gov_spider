    The United States strongly condemns the recent attacks on innocent civilians attending church services in Kenya. The attacks on two churches in Garissa follow shortly after the killing of one aid worker and the kidnapping of four others in Dadaab refugee camp this week, as well as an attack on a nightclub in Mombasa last weekend. The perpetrators of these attacks have shown no respect for human life and dignity, and must be brought to justice for these heinous acts.
At a time of transition, peace and stability are essential to Kenya's progress. We support those who recognize Kenya's ethnic and religious diversity as one of the country's greatest strengths.
The United States extends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to those wounded by these attacks, and we stand with the Kenyan people at this difficult time.
