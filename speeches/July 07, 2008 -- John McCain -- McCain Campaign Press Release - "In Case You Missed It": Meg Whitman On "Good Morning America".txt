Meg Whitman: "He is going to focus on, first, growing the economy which is all about small business. Seventy percent of new jobs created every year in the U.S. are by small businesses. So he wants to create a tax policy and health care and energy policy that helps small businesses grow. And then, of course, we have to get government spending under control. The federal government is 58% bigger today than it was even eight years ago, and John McCain is the one, I think, who can really lead the country and a bipartisan effort of Congress to say we have got to get this under control. So we will have lower taxes that will accelerate growth in the economy and we will get government spending under control and the budget balanced by 2013." 
ABC's Diane Sawyer: "But the promise of getting government spending under control is as old as Adam and Eve. How is he going to do it when no one else has?" 
Meg Whitman: "Well, the first part, of course, is to exercise leadership and lay out the agenda and deliver a bipartisan effort. He will call for a pause in discretionary spending -- non-vet, non-military spending, a pause for a year to do a line by line, stem to stern review of the federal government and make sure every plan is working. The federal government itself says that many of the federal programs are no longer working. We need to digitize the federal government and make sure we're running a limited and efficient government. You know what I would love taxpayers to say at the end of John McCain's first term, 'The federal government is spending money like it is our own.' And of course it is the taxpayers' money."
