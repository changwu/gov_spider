    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Waxman (D) CA)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 670, which would authorize appropriations through FY 1995 for the family planning program authorized by title X of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. The clinics supported by title X of the PHS Act provide essential reproductive health services to poor women.
In addition, the provisions in the bill requiring projects to provide complete information regarding pregnancy management are consistent with the President's recent directive to suspend and revoke the so-called "gag rule." The Administration believes strongly that title X projects should provide pregnant women with complete medical information and counseling regarding their pregnancies.
