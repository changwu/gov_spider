Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France & Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard & smart. We will come back STRONG!:: https://t.co/hhwYOrnWZnRetweets: 20426Favorites: 74640

Jake, this wasn't a Trump Rally, but rather a very successful gathering of the great Sheriffs and Law Enforcement (of Florida) who gave me their unequivocal ENDORSEMENT. No Defund the Police here. Best Wishes! https://t.co/xloRKGnb97Retweets: 18114Favorites: 62729

Peggy Noonan, a "Concast" MSDNC @WSJ puppet, doesn't have a clue, and hasn't for many years. Never got the "Trump thing". She plays right into the hands of the stupid people!Retweets: 13001Favorites: 53187

I actually agree with this. Too much income disparity. Changes must be made, and soon! https://t.co/YZx6gPDTMbRetweets: 28156Favorites: 100484

"Biden to raise taxes by 3 Trillion Dollars." Actually, it will be much more than that, and much of it on nonsense. Markets and your 401k's will CRASH. Jobs will disappear!Retweets: 30242Favorites: 114844
