    Hillary and I are saddened to hear that John Robert Starr has passed away. He was a legendary figure in Little Rock and Arkansas history. As a former Arkansas bureau chief for the Associated Press, managing editor of the Arkansas Democrat and Democrat-Gazette, and a tough-as-nails columnist, John Robert always said and did what he thought was right.
John Robert was as tenacious a friend as he was a foe. In good and bad times alike, I always knew him to speak his mind and say exactly what he felt. That kind of candor can be strong medicine, but I learned to respect him for it. His legion of readers might not always agree with his point of view, but they read what he had to say.
Hillary and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Norma, their three children, and their many friends.
