    Earlier today, the President met with newly appointed Special Envoy for Sudan Ambassador Princeton Lyman at the White House. The meeting comes at a critical time with only 99 days remaining before the end of the interim period of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The President expressed his gratitude for Ambassador Lyman's long service on Africa, for his willingness to lead U.S. efforts on Sudan, and told Ambassador Lyman that he has the full support of the White House. During the meeting, the President outlined his serious concerns over the situation in Abyei and the impact that increased bombings are having on civilians in Darfur. The President underscored his commitment to the establishment of two viable states in northern and South Sudan in July. They discussed the urgency of all parties joining the new opportunities in the Doha Peace Process and of elevating the level of international engagement on Darfur. The President charged Ambassador Lyman, working closely with his Senior Advisor for Darfur Dane Smith, to increase efforts towards achieving a lasting ceasefire and political settlement at Darfur peace negotiations in Doha.
At the President's behest, Ambassador Lyman will make two trips to the region in the next monthâ€”one focused on Comprehensive Peace Agreement implementation and the other dedicated to Darfur. Ambassador Lyman leaves on the first of these trips this weekend and will provide the President with his findings and recommendations upon his return.
