New York Representative Peter King is backing Marco for president, joining a wave of leaders that understand that Marco is the right candidate to be commander-in-chief.
Here's why Rep. King is backing Marco:
Republicans can't afford to forfeit this race to Hillary Clinton by nominating the wrong candidate. I'm endorsing Marco Rubio because he has all the ingredients for a winning campaign: inspiration, judgement, and vision. He can be trusted to deliver real results once he is in office. Most important of all for me, Marco has a thorough knowledge of foreign policy and fully understands the true nature of the terrorist threat.

Congressman King represents New York's 2nd congressional district. He was first elected to Congress in 1993, and was the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee from 2005 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2013. He also serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
