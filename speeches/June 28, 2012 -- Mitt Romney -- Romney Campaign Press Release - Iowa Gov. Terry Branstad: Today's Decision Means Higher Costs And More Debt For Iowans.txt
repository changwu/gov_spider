    Iowa Governor Terry Branstad and Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds made the following statements on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
Governor Terry Branstad said, "Today, the Supreme Court handed down a disastrous decision to uphold President Obama's destructive healthcare law, which means a future of higher costs, fewer choices, and increasing debt for Iowans. The current healthcare system is nothing but a federal takeover that will cost the country trillions of dollars in new federal spending. But, as Governor Romney has said many times, no matter what may happen in court, the American people must remain vigilant in their fight to repeal the law. Our goal is for Iowa to become the healthiest state in the country and to do so Iowans will need to take ownership of their own health to reduce healthcare costs and lead healthier lives."
On today's decision by the Supreme Court, Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds said, "America needs real healthcare reform and we need Governor Romney in Washington. Governor Romney will enact real reforms to ensure that the future of Iowa and America as a whole can replace Obamacare with solutions that put Iowans in control of their own healthcare and preserve the economic future of Iowa's next generation."
