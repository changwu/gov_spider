    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Reps. Hunter (R) CA and Sensenbrenner (R) WI)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 6166, the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This legislation establishes a statutory structure for prosecution before military commissions of alien unlawful enemy combatants in the War on Terror for violations of the laws of war. The legislation also permits the United States to effectively gather information from captured terrorists that is needed to protect Americans from further terrorist attack. Prompt enactment of the legislation will assist in the effective conduct of the War on Terror and in bringing terrorists to justice.
