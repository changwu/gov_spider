    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders beats the most popular Republican White House hopefuls by margins as big or bigger than Hillary Clinton, according to a new Quinnipiac University Poll released on Wednesday.
"The survey demonstrated Sanders' remarkable strength as a general election candidate based on his enormous popularity among young voters, his standing as the most trusted candidate and his strength with independents," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "This is the latest evidence that Bernie is the most electable candidate the Democrats could nominate."
In the head-to-head pairings, Sanders "does just as well, or even better, against top Republicans" than Clinton, according to Douglas Schwartz, the Quinnipiac poll director. Sanders led Donald Trump 49 percent to 41 percent. He held a 49 to 39 percent lead over Sen. Ted Cruz, a 47 to 41 percent advantage over Dr. Ben Carson and a 44 to 43 percent edge over Sen. Marco Rubio.
When voters are asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable view of candidates, Sanders is viewed more favorably than Clinton, Trump, Carson Rubio or Cruz, according to the independent pollster.
Moreover, according to Quinnipiac "Sanders gets the best honesty grades among top candidates."
"Some voters still don't know Bernie as well as Secretary Clinton, but the more they know him the better they like him," Weaver said. "Bernie is generating the kind of excitement and enthusiasm needed for Democrats to retain the White House and elect more Democrats in Congress and state capitals."
