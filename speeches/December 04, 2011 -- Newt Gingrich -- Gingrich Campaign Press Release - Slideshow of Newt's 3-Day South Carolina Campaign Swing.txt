On a recent three-day swing that took him from Hilton Head to Greenville, Gingrich was greeted by overflowing crowds, including the largest ever turnout (800+) for Congressman Tim Scott's ongoing Presidential Town Hall series.
In Greenville, 500 people attended a Town Hall meeting with Newt at Tommy's Ham House and 1,000 came out to Bluffton for a Town Hall meeting and the opening of the Newt 2012 Beaufort County Victory Office.
