    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendment to the FY 2009 Budget for the Department of the Interior. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2009 Budget would not be affected by this amendment.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
