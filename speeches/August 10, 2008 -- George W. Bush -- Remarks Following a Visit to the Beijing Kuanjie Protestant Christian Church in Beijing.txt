    You know, I've justâ€”Laura and I just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in Beijing, China. You know, it just goes to show that God is universal and God is love and no state, man, or woman should fear the influence of loving religion.
And I want to thank the pastor for his hospitality. And I want to thank this beautiful choir for singing "Amazing Grace" and "Edelweiss." It was a touching moment. It's been a joy to worship here. Again, I want to thank you, sir, and God bless you. God bless you.
