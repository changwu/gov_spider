The campaign is continuing President Trump's approach of reaching out to the American people by directly highlighting his work over the first 100 days with this ad as well as fighting back against the continued media bias.
"It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country. It's clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn't fit their narrative," said Michael Glassner, Executive Director.
CNN takes issue with the ad's message calling out the mainstream media for peddling fake news and not reporting on the fact that President Trump is making America great again.
