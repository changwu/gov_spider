    I have signed into law, H.R. 2992, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Amendments of 1977.
This bill provides a 1-year extension of appropriation authority for the Nation's basic system for furthering employment and training opportunities for the unemployed and economically disadvantaged. It is also the authority for many of my economic stimulus employment programs.
I requested a simple extension for 1 year, fiscal year 1978, so that my administration could quickly provide needed temporary employment and training programs under my economic stimulus program. In the coming months, we will have the time to review with the Congress the issues and concerns for the employment and training system of the future. The results of our mutual deliberations will form the basis for legislative recommendations for the next session of Congress.
I want to express my thanks to both Houses of Congress for acting on this extension bill expeditiously. The Congress is also making rapid progress on the last remaining authorization for the economic stimulus package, the bill to authorize new initiatives to address youth unemployment. I look forward to receiving that bill in the near future.
