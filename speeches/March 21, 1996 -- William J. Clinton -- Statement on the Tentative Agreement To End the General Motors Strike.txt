    I am pleased that the United Auto Workers and General Motors have reached a tentative agreement. GM and the UAW have a long and proud history of working together to solve their disputes. Both sides have worked hard to settle this dispute and I congratulate them for spending long hours at the bargaining table and arriving at a tentative agreement which will hopefully send more than 150,000 workers back to their jobs.
When American corporations work together with their workers, we can meet our challenge to grow the economy and provide families higher wages and increased economic security.
