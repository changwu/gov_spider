    Today, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg met in the Oval Office with a bipartisan group of Members of Congress from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to discuss the critical need to invest in modern and sustainable American infrastructure, including strengthening and enhancing American roads, bridges, waterways, schools, housing, and more. The discussion follows a bipartisan meeting the Administration held with Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee last month and it is part of ongoing engagements on infrastructure with Members of Congress and stakeholders.
The President, Vice President, Secretary, and Members of Congress discussed their shared commitment to working across the aisle to build modern and sustainable infrastructure in rural, suburban, and urban areas across the country that create good-paying, union jobs and support the economic recovery. They also shared their commitment for ensuring new and existing infrastructure is modernized to withstand the impacts of climate change while creating jobs with the choice to join a union and leading the world in a clean energy revolution. Additionally, they emphasized the Administration's commitment to creating skilled-trades jobs across construction, manufacturing, and engineering sectors, fulfilling our obligation to working communities too often left behind, and positioning America to compete and win the 21st century.
The Administration leaders were grateful to hold a constructive conversation about delivering infrastructure and jobs for American communities and to exchange ideas that further inform President Biden's economic recovery plans to build back better for working families.
