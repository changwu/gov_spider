    The President called Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand to thank him for successfully chairing the meeting of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) leaders in Bali, Indonesia on October 8 and to discuss the productive outcomes from the meeting. The two leaders welcomed the agreement among leaders that the twelve member nations will work toward the ambitious goal of concluding negotiations this year, and they committed to intensifying efforts to reach that goal. As the TPP Leaders Statement noted, this comprehensive and high standard agreement is a model for future trade agreements and a promising pathway to our APEC goal of building a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.
