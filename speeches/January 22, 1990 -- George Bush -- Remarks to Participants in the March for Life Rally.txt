    Well, at first I want to welcome all of you gathered in Washington from around the country for this year's March for Life. Before you begin the march, I want to take a minute to share my deep, personal concern about abortion on demand, which I oppose.
For 17 years, the March for Life has served as a poignant reminder to all Americans that human life in all its forms must be respected. And I think all of you know my deep conviction on Roe versus Wade. The continuing strong presence of the March for Life reminds those of us in decisionmaking capacities -- in the White House and in the Congress and in the Court -- that millions of Americans care fundamentally about this issue and are committed to preserving the sanctity of life.
Your movement also reminds Americans, especially young Americans, of the self-evident moral superiority of adoption over abortion. We should all be grateful to the families that adopt babies, giving them care and love and a chance for a wonderful life.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that this President stands with you on this issue of life and that my prayers go out to all of you for your faith and courage. God bless you, and God bless life. Thank you very much.
