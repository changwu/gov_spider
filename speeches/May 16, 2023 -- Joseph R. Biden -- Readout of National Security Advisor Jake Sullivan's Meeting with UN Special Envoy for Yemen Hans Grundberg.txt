    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg on May 15 at the White House. Mr. Sullivan underscored President Biden's commitment to ending the war in Yemen. He welcomed the remarkable progress since the UN-mediated truce first went into effect in April of last year, leading to the quietest period Yemenis have had since the war began nearly a decade ago. The two also discussed the importance of continued donor support to mitigate Yemen's humanitarian crisis. They agreed to remain in close contact as efforts continue to transition from the truce to a comprehensive, inclusive UN-led political process.
