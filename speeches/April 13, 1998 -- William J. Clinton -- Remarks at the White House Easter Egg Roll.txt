    The President. Thank you. Good morning. Isn't it a wonderful morning? Let me say, I want to thank all the volunteers and all the sponsors who've made this wonderful day possible for thousands and thousands of young people.
I also want to say that the first official White House egg roll occurred here in 1878 when President Rutherford Hayes was living in the White House. Now, a lot of things have changed since then, but the most important thing today that you need to know is that for the very first time, hundreds of thousands of young people will be experiencing the White House egg roll through the Internet, thanks to EarthLinks, and I want to thank them for that.
I'd also like to thank a number of others, and especially Sun Microsystems, for all the work that's been done to try to open the White House to people around the world and especially around our country. But this day is special because of what EarthLinks has done to let lots and lots of young people who never could come to the White House be part of the egg roll.
So, are we ready to start the egg roll?
Hillary Clinton. Bernie's right here.
The President. Bernie, where's the whistle? This is the one thing every year I know, no matter what else happens, I will do right. [Laughter] Are you ready, kids? Are you ready?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. I'm going to count to three and blow the whistle. One, two, three!
