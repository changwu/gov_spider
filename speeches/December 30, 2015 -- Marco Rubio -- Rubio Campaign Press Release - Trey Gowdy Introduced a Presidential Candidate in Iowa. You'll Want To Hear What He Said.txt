It was big news when it was announced that South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy was throwing his support behind Marco's campaign.
Yesterday, he hit the trail for the first time — and what he said about Marco was pretty memorable.

This was just the first stop on their two-day swing through the critical caucus state.

Here was his case for Marco:
I'm voting for Marco Rubio, and I'll tell you why — national security and public safety are the most important issues to me, and there is nobody better on those two issues than Marco Rubio. Our founding fathers did not give us a Commander in Chief to fill out March Madness basketball brackets, or to sample every golf course on the Eastern seaboard. Our founding fathers gave us a President and a Commander in Chief because they understood that national security, public safety, law, justice, and order are the foundations of a free people.

Gowdy also thanked Iowa Republicans for their hard work on the ground for Marco. The tour continues with additional stops today.
