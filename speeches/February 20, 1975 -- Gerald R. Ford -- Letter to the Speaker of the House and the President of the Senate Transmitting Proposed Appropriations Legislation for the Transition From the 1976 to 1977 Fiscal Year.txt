    I AM transmitting herewith draft legislation to authorize appropriations on a Government-wide basis for the period July 1, 1976 through September 30, 1976.
This bill is designed to aid the transition to the new Federal fiscal year period of October 1-September 30 which is scheduled to begin with fiscal year 1977 under P.L. 93-344, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It would carry out in large measure the requirement of Section 502(a) (2) of P.L. 93-344 that the President prepare and submit to the Congress "proposed legislation he considers appropriate with respect to changes in law necessary to provide authorizations of appropriations" for the three-month period of transition to the new fiscal year.
I believe the attached draft bill provides the most expeditious approach for easing the Government's transition to funding on the new fiscal year basis and enabling timely provision of funding for the transition quarter. I request that it be referred to the appropriate committee and urge its prompt enactment.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
