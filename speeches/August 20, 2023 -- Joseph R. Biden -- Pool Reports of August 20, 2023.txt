Out-of-town pool report #1: Briefing from FEMA administrator
Hi there,
I'm your pooler for today. Our call time is 3pm but we just had this from the White House:
The President received a briefing this afternoon from FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and senior White House staff on the latest status of response and recovery efforts in Maui ahead of his travel to the island tomorrow. He also received updates on emergency preparedness work related to Hurricane Hilary.
