PAUL RYAN: "This is not an ordinary election because it is not an ordinary time. We have a big choice to make. We're not just picking the next president for a few years. We are picking the pathway for America for a generation. And what Mitt Romney and I pledge is to make sure that you get to choose, what kind of country do we want to have? What kind of people do we want to be? It comes down to that because the stakes of this election are so high. We've seen what the President has offered. We have seen the path he has placed us on. It's a nation in debt. It's a nation in doubt. It's a nation in decline. Or we can choose a better path, reapply those founding principles, reclaim the American idea and get people back to work and get the American idea of prosperity and an opportunity society back on track. And that's exactly what we are going to do."
