    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Clay (D) (MO) and 238 others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 3400, which repeals the Hatch Act's restrictions on partisan political activity by Federal employees. This bill would undermine the integrity and independence of the traditionally non-partisan civil service by allowing unfettered off-duty partisan electioneering and political activity by all Federal employees. Under its terms, Federal employees would be vulnerable to both direct and subtle political pressures to "volunteer" help in campaigns and to make financial contributions in order to curry favor with one political party or another. The bill's proposed safeguards against abuse would be inadequate and largely unenforceable, inviting political corruption. The unacceptable result would be a politicized Federal workforce to the clear detriment of the public interest.
If this bill were to reach the President's desk, his senior advisers would recommend its disapproval.
