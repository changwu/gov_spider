    "It is highly offensive that the Obama campaign believes women either haven't noticed or aren't smart enough to care about how devastating President Obama's failed economic policies have been for us. On President Obama's watch, women have lost 419,000 jobs, their poverty rate is the highest it's been in 17 years, and we shoulder $16,000 more in national debt as a result of his misguided economic policies. Worse still, all we can expect from President Obama's second term is more of the same. Clearly, women can't afford another four years like the last four years." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Today, Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Claimed Women Aren't "Really Concerned About What's Happened Over The Last Four Years":
Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter: "That's The Other Thing That You Find Most Often With Women: They're Not Really Concerned About What's Happened Over The Last Four Years." CUTTER: "You know, we'll continue doing what we have been doing: trying to get the president's message out on the ground. You know, whether it's in the suburban areas of Northern Virginia or Denver or Ohio to talk about what the president wants to do in the future. That's the other thing that you find most often with women: they're not really concerned about what's happened over the last four years. They really want to know what's going to happen in the next four years." (NPR's "Diane Rehm Show," 9/24/12)
