    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Charles F.C. Ruff, who served as my White House Counsel from 1997 to 1999. All of us at the White House admired Chuck for the power of his advocacy, the wisdom of his judgment, and the strength of his leadership. We loved him for his generous spirit and his keen wit, which he used to find humor in even the most challenging circumstances.
Chuck had an extraordinary and distinguished career in private practice with Covington & Burling, and in public service as Special Prosecutor, Acting Deputy Attorney General, and United States Attorney and Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia. We will miss his counsel and friendship deeply.
Hillary and I extend our condolences to his wife, Sue, his daughters, Carin and Christy, and his mother, Margaret.
