PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF: (In progress) elected peoples swearing in at the parliament. I'm absolutely --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It was a very special day, a very special occasion. Well, I'm delighted to be back. I, obviously, on behalf of the President, just -- the American people wanted to express our sorrow at the tremendous tragedy that you had with the earthquake. We're delighted we've been able to be partners in helping address this. And one of the things I wanted to do today, obviously, is to have a chance to see some of our people who are involved with those relief efforts.
PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF: And I would -- let me express our special gratitude to the United States for all the assistance all along -- the commitment of financial assistance, but other than that, the assistance in the relief operation in the form of helicopters, especially because I don't think we could have managed the relief operation without your ships. They have been a main part of the relief operation.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF: The main contributions to reach the people.
