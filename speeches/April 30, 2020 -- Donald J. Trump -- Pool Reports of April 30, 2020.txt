"I think we're going to have a great third quarter." "I think next year is going to be a spectacular year." Said there is "pent up demand."
"We just got hit by a vicious virus that should have never been allowed to escape China, they should have stopped it at the source, they didn't do that."
On the intelligence statement saying cornavirus is not man made: " I haven't seen the report yet, but I will tell you if you speak to the head of intelligence right now and you speak to the head. They did say that I was given a briefing, when I said I was given it, not before, and they also said that it wasn't specific and it wasnt a panic briefing it wasn't like, oh we're going to be invaded." Trump later wouldn't say whether that briefing happened in January but that He would release a report on it.

In Town Pool Report # 4: Kayleigh McEnany gaggle
Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany took a few questions in the briefing room just now (not from the podium). Partial transcript below, questions paraphrased:
Q-Is the seniors event today about shoring up his approval rating with seniors?A- "No not in the slightest. Seniors are a vulnerable population, they've been hit by this hard so the president wants to show the steps this administration has been taking to protect seniors. Nothing to do with polling but everything to do with ensuring that our nation's seniors feel protected at this time."
Q-how does the president feel about dropping in the polls?A-"The president is concerned about one thing and one thing alone and that's protecting the health and well being of the American people."
Q-Trump says China is doing everything to prevent him from being elected. What does he think they're doing?A: "Why would China want to reelect a president that finally had the courage to go toe to toe (with them)? He just is noting the fact China would like to see someone else in this position".
Q-Jared Kushner's comments framing this as a success for the administration inappropriate when more than 60,000 have died?A-"I think Jared has been taken entirely out of context. What Jared is referring to is when we came into this there was this discussion about ventilators for example, there would be this ventilator shortage in New York, needing 40,000 ventilators, and the success story is that this administration mobilized the greatest efforts since WWII that we provided something like 4000 ventilators to New York...Not a single American died in this country for lack of a ventilator. I would call that response a success."
Q-What about a Washington Post report saying the admin is weighing a move to allow US citizens to sue China?A: "I'm not at all read into that issue."
Q: Guidance on future Ohio trip?A: "I don't have any guidance to give you. I know the Arizona trip will be Tuesday at Honeywell."
Q: "Are you going to be taking the podium soon?"A: "Never say never."Q: "Anything scheduled?"A: "We'll see."

HHS sec Alex Azar and Va sec Wilkie both tout their agencies efforts to help seniors. Wilkie says infection rate is "low" at VA nursing homes and credits that to Trump.

In town pool report #7 Trump takes qs in East room
check against transcript:
Trump on Biden accusation: "I don't know anything about it. I think he should respond. It could be false accusationsâ€”I know all about false accusations." Says he's been falsely accused and what happened to Kavanaugh was a "disgrace". "I can't speak for Biden, I can only say I think he should respond."
Would he pardon Flynn? "It looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated...I don't know that anybody would have to use that power." "Hopefully we wouldn't have to get there." Says he would "consider" bringing him back into the administration.
On Jared Kushner saying the response was a great success story: "He's saying the facts." Says US is now giving ventilators to other countries. "I don't think anybody's done a better job with testing, with ventilators...we had very little to work with." "When somebody uses the word successful it has been successful."
"China is a very sophisticated country they could have contained it.""China doesn't want to see me elected...I don't want to cast any aspersions I just tell you that China would like to see sleepy joe Biden."
"I think next year we're going to have a phenomenal year economically."
Trump on some governors who want to strip unemployment if workers don't go back to work due to extra 600/week in unemployment insurance. "It's short term and we're being very generous with people who lost their job so it's not the biggest problem I've ever heard." He says Dems wanted the extra money and he warned some people might want to stay on unemployment because of it.
Lower the flag for Covid deaths: "I think lowering the flags would be something very appropriate."
"I don't think anybody can feel worse than I do about all the death and destruction that's so needless...but at the same time, we have to get our country open again."

In town pool report #7a more Trump q&a
The president took questions for 38 minutes.
Trump asked if he's seen intelligence indicating with a high degree of confidence that the virus originated from a Wuhan Lab. "Yes I have," he says.
But later says "there's a lot of theories." "We're going to see where it is, we're going to see where it comes from."
Asked how he feels confident it came from the Wuhan lab, Trump says: "I'm not allowed to tell you that."
Is he demanding inspection of the lab? "So far I think China is trying to somewhat transparent with us."
On Kim jong un: "Well I understand what's going on...I just hope everything is going to be fine" says he can't talk about his condition now
On aid for states: "The democrats have come to us and they'd like to do a phase 4" bill with bailouts for states. .. "They happen to be democratic states" it's California, NY and Illinois. "the republican states are doing very well. Maybe the democrats should have brought this up earlier""I think we want to take a little bit of a pause but if we do that we have to get something for it."
Trump says he hasn't decided on whether he's wearing a mask for his Arizona trip next week. "I have no problem wearing a mask."
