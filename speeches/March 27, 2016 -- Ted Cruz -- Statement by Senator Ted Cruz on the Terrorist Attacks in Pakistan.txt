    HOUSTON, Texas - The Cruz for President campaign released the following statement regarding the deadly terrorist attacks in Pakistan today:
"The evil that is radical Islamism struck in Pakistan today-the very day we celebrate the resurrection of the Prince of Peace-in a shocking display of savagery," said Cruz. "Once again we are reminded there are no holidays from this enemy, and no one-not commuters going to work in Brussels, not mothers and children celebrating Easter in a park in Lahore-are immune from its wrath. We must redouble our resolve to band with friends and allies to defeat it. Our prayers are with our brothers and sisters in Pakistan."
