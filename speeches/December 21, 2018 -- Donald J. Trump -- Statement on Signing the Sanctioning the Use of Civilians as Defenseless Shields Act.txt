    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3342, the "Sanctioning the Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act" (the "Act"). Section 3 of the Act purports to require the President to impose mandatory sanctions, including asset blocking and restrictions on entry into the United States, on certain foreign nationals. My Administration will apply these provisions consistent with the constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations, including the President's authority under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to "receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers." Furthermore, my Administration will apply the provisions of section 3 consistent with 8 U.S.C. section 1182(d)(5)(A) (section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act), as amended by section 402 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, which provides the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to parole into the United States, to achieve a significant public benefit, a foreign national whose presence is sought for law enforcement purposes.
