    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Ford (D) Michigan)
While the administration recognizes that certain technical amendments to FERS are necessary, it is opposed to enactment of H.R. 3395 in its present form. None of the changes in this bill is so urgent as to require its enactment without full Committee consideration of a number of objectionable and controversial provisions that were included in the House bill without consultation with the administration. The administration would like to work with the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee to obtain needed improvements in the bill.
