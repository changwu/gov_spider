    The President. I just had a great meeting with Members of the House and Senate. The Vice President and I came up to congratulate the Speaker and the leader on a season of accomplishment. We've got an obligation to help those who suffer. America's a great, strong country. We're also a compassionate country.
And I thank the Members of the House and Senate for passing an AIDS bill that will help the people of Africa, a really good piece of legislation, a great piece of work by the Speaker and the leader and other Members.
I also came to congratulate them on the soon-to-be passage of an economic jobs-and-growth bill. This is a Congress which is able to identify problems facing the American people and get things done. These are can-do people, and I'm real proud of the work they've done.
I look forward to signing the economic recovery bill soon. The principle of the bill is pretty simple, that we believe the more money people have in their pockets, the more likely it is somebody is going to be able to find work in America. In other words, the more money somebody has, it means somebody is more likely to demand a good or a service, which means somebody will produce a good or a service, which means somebody is likely to find work.
This bill I'm going to sign is good for American workers. It is good for American families. It is good for American investors, and it's good for American entrepreneurs and small-business owners. These two bodies are fixing to go on a well-deserved break. And when they come back, we're going to work together on reforming of Medicare.
Q. Mr. President?
The President. And furthermore—[laughter]—thank you for your time. [Laughter] Thank you.
