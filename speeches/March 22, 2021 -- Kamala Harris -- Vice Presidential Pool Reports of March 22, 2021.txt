correction on VP#6
Administrator Guzman had in attendance her husband and two sons and an assistant. Vp Harris was first in the room. the swearing in happened with the VP reading from her stationary card. They posed for pictures and then all left the room I asked about any concerns about astra zenicka she kept walking with no comment out of the door. Now pool duty is handed over
