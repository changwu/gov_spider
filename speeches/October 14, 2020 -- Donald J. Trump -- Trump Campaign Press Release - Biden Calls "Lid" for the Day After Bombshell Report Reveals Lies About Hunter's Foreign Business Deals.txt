    On the morning of the explosive reporting in the New York Post that Joe Biden lied to the American people about never discussing his son Hunter's foreign business deals, Biden's campaign immediately announced that the former vice president would be making no public appearances. The Biden campaign "called a lid" for the day at 9:41 a.m.

In the Post's reporting, emails recovered from a laptop, which has been seized by the FBI, reveal that Hunter Biden arranged a 2015 meeting in Washington, DC with his father and Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. One email from Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden says, "thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,"
An earlier email from Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden asks for "advice on how you could use your influence."
Biden has previously claimed to have no knowledge of his son's business schemes, saying, "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."
Less than a year after Joe Biden met with Pozharskyi and Hunter Biden, then-Vice President Biden pressured Ukrainian officials into firing the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.
