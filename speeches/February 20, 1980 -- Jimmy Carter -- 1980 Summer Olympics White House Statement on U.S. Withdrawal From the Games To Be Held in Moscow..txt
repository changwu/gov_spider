    On January 20, the President wrote to President Kane of the United States Olympic Committee to urge the committee to propose to the International Olympic Committee that the 1980 summer games in Moscow be transferred, postponed, or cancelled if Soviet forces were not fully withdrawn from Afghanistan within a month. The President also urged that if these proposals were not adopted, the United States Committee should not send a team to the Moscow games. This position has been overwhelmingly supported by the United States Congress and the American people.
On February 12, the International Olympic Committee announced it would adhere to its plans to conduct the games in Moscow. On February 14, President Kane of the United States Olympic Committee issued a statement saying the United States Olympic Committee would, of course, accept any decision the President makes as to whether a team should be sent to Moscow.
A month has now expired, and Soviet forces have not even begun to withdraw from Afghanistan. The President has therefore advised the United States Olympic Committee that his decision remains unchanged and that we should not send a team to Moscow. The President thanked the committee for its earnest and patriotic efforts to present the case for transferring, postponing, or cancelling the games and asked it to take prompt action to formalize its acceptance of his decision.
The United States Olympic Committee depends for its funds on the generosity of American citizens and American business. Even though no United States team is sent to Moscow, the committee carries on many other important and worthwhile activities to support athletic excellence in this country. The President urges. all American citizens to continue their financial and moral support of the committee.
