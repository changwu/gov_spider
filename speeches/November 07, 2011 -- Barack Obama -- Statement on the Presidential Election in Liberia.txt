    The Liberian people will go to the polls tomorrow to elect the next President of Liberia. This historic vote is an opportunity for Liberians to strengthen the country's democracy and to deepen its peace, prosperity, and national unity. We encourage all voters of all political preferences to exercise their universal right to participate in the democratic process. All Liberians should have the ability to exercise this right without fear of violence or intimidation.
Liberia has taken important steps to consolidate its democracy since the end of its civil war. Those gains must not be set back by individuals who seek to disrupt the political process. The international community will hold accountable those who choose to obstruct the democratic process. We encourage all security forces in Liberia to exercise maximum restraint and to allow peaceful protest. And we commend all that international election observers, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UN-MIL), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Liberian people are doing to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful runoff election.
The United States is deeply committed to its historic relationship with Liberia and its people. We are also deeply committed to the strength of democracy on the African Continent. In that spirit, we will continue to strongly support the success of a peaceful democratic process for the Liberian people and the peace and prosperity of Liberia.
