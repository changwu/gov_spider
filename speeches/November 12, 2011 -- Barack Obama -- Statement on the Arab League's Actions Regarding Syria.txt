    I applaud the important decisions taken by the Arab League today, including the suspension of Syria's membership, consideration of economic sanctions, and downgrading of diplomatic relations. After the Asad regime flagrantly failed to keep its commitments, the Arab League has demonstrated leadership in its effort to end the crisis and hold the Syrian Government accountable. These significant steps expose the increasing diplomatic isolation of a regime that has systematically violated human rights and repressed peaceful protests. The United States joins with the Arab League in its support for the Syrian people, who continue to demand their universal rights in the face of the regime's callous violence. We will continue to work with our friends and allies to pressure the Asad regime and support the Syrian people as they pursue the dignity and transition to democracy that they deserve.
