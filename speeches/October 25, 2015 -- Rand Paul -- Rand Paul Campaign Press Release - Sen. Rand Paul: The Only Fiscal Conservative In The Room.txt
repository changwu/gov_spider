    BOULDER, CO- Sen. Rand Paul tonight proved that he is the only fiscal conservative on the CNBC Republican Primary debate stage. Since taking office, Sen. Paul has implemented common-sense solutions that will solve our nation's fiscal crisis-- solutions like a Balanced Budget Amendment, an Audit the Fed bill, spending cuts, and was named the 'most frugal' legislator by the National Taxpayers Union. Sen. Paul has also introduced a Fair and Flat Tax Plan that would repeal the entire IRS tax code-more than 70,000 pages-and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5 percent on individuals and businesses.
"Tonight we saw nine politicians and one statesman discussing the critical economic issues faced by our great nation. Sen. Paul's message of economic freedom, a fair and flat tax rate of 14.5 percent for all Americans, and fighting Washington corruption stands in stark contrast with big spending Republicans who shared the stage. Republicans have to answer one question in this primary: what kind of message will most likely defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sen. Paul's message of liberty continues to resonate across the country because he is the best candidate to take on the Washington Machine," said Doug Stafford, Chief Strategist.
