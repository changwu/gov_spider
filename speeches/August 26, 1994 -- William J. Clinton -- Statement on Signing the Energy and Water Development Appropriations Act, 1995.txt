    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4506, the "Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, FY 1995."
The Act provides a total of $20.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for various programs in the Departments of Energy and the Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers, and several smaller agencies.
I am pleased that the Act substantially funds most of my budget requests for priority investment programs within the Departments of Energy and the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers, including full funding for the renewable energy portions of the Climate Change Action Plan.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, August 26, 1994.
