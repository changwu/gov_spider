    Today, United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC), Vishal Amin, issued the United States Annual Intellectual Property Report for 2020. The report details the actions and activities taken over the past year by the United States to promote, protect, and prioritize our great competitive advantage â€“ our Nation's innovative economy. In 2017, the Trump Administration adopted a four-part intellectual property strategy that has provided a framework for sound intellectual property policy to advance innovation and creativity and ensure effective intellectual property protection and enforcement domestically and abroad.
"From day one, the Administration has had a singular focus on strengthening and growing our Nation's innovative economy," stated Coordinator Amin. "The actions that we have taken to protect American intellectual property have helped set the United States on a path to remain not only an economic leader, but a powerhouse of innovation, invention, and creativity for decades to come."
