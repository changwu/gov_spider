    To All Disabled Veterans:
It is my privilege to convey to you at this holiday season the nation's tribute of remembrance and gratitude for your service in defense of our country.
Your sacrifices and sufferings have called forth the solicitude of the nation expressed in the services which have been established to minister to your needs.
In extending to you a greeting of good cheer at Christmas I express my earnest personal wish and that of all our people that the New Year may bring to you abundant blessings of contentment, health, hope and restoration. I send you renewed assurance of the nation's gratitude and devotion to your needs.
HERBERT HOOVER
