    I am extremely pleased and gratified by the Senate's action today in confirming Dr. Joycelyn Elders as the Nation's next Surgeon General. Dr. Elders has consistently demonstrated a high level of intellect, courage, and wisdom in dealing with the wide range of health and social problems facing our country. Her dedication to improving the lives of all Americans, especially the children of America, won her the strong backing of a bipartisan majority of the Senate. I look forward to working with her in confronting the pressing issues facing the public health of our Nation.
I am especially grateful to Senator Kennedy for his steady leadership during the Labor and Human Resources Committee's consideration of Dr. Elders' nomination. Senator Kennedy's dedication to this nominee was extraordinary.
