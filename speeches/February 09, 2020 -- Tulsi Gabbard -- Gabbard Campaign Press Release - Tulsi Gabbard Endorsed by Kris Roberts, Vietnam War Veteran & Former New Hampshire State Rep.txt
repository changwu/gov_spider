    MANCHESTER, N.H. â€” Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (U.S. Rep, Hawaii) was endorsed by Kris Roberts, a veteran of the Vietnam War and a former New Hampshire state representative. Roberts served in the Marines for 26 years, and he was the first black committee chairman in the New Hampshire legislature, where he supervised veterans' affairs. Roberts was a member of the New Hampshire veterans' steering committee for the Obama campaign in 2008.
"My vote is very important to me," said Roberts. "If a candidate wants my vote, he or she must earn it. Tulsi Gabbard has earned my vote. I believe she is leader who is capable of making hard and unpopular decisions based on the common good; not based on her own political or personal gain. No false campaign promises."
Tulsi has spent over 100 days campaigning in New Hampshire since kicking off her campaign in January of 2019 and conducted town halls across the Granite State.
