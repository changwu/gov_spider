    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Bentsen (D) TX)
The Administration strongly supports the agreement that was reached with the National Governors Association. This agreement allows the Medicaid program in every State to continue their pre- September 30, 1991 policies until at least October 1, 1992, and in some cases through June 30, 1993. Further, the agreement equitably addresses the individual fiscal concerns of the States while assuring the long-term structural integrity of the Medicaid program.
The Compromise agreement should be passed this year before Congress adjourns. This is a major health and fiscal policy problem for Federal and State governments. The States and many legislatures need clear legislative or regulatory policy guidance before State legislatures meet next spring.
The Administration opposes any temporary moratorium that would leave these issues unresolved until March 1992 or later. Should legislation be presented to the President that includes a "two- sided" moratorium that precludes Federal regulatory activity, and State program expansions, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it if it is not consistent with the Budget Enforcement Act.
