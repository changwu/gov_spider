    This morning the Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to the community notification provision of New Jersey's "Megan's Law," thus leaving intact a crucial tool to protect children from known sexual predators. Because of the importance of this law to families and communities, my administration has defended its constitutionality, enacted a similar Federal Megan's Law, and worked with States to establish a national sex offender registry. We will continue to do everything we can to make sure that community notification and sex offender registration laws are enforced and upheld throughout the country.
