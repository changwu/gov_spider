    Cedar County Democrats Chair, former Tipton School Board member, and retired farmer Larry Hodgden announced his endorsement of Senator Kamala Harris today. His endorsement comes one day after Harris announced her plan to combat President Trump's war on rural America and fight for justice for rural Americans at a meet and greet in Tipton.
Hodgden specifically pointed to Harris' rural agenda as a central reason for his endorsement. "I've lived in this rural community my entire life, over 70 years. So I know what it takes for a rural community to thrive and grow. It takes a strong farm economy, it takes strong local businesses, good schools, and everything that Kamala Harris spoke to in her rural America plan addressed those issues that will make small, rural communities, strong," said Hodgden.
"I know she's a fighter. She stands up for what she believes in and I think would work hard for all Americans. We need someone like Kamala Harris in the White House to get this country moving in the right direction," he continued.
Harris is hosting a house party in Clinton today. On Sunday, Harris will return to Iowa for her fourth trip of the month for a four-day swing through the state that will include stops in Cedar Rapids, Marshalltown, Waterloo, Vinton, and Iowa City.
