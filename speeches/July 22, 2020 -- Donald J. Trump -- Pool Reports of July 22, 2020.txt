 Pool report #5 
List of attendees. President entered room at 356 pm
Today, President Donald J. Trump will provide an update on Operation Legend, the coordinated law enforcement initiative that recently surged federal resources to Kansas City in an effort to help local officials fight the surge of violent crime in the city. Under the direction of President Trump, the Department of Justice launched Operation Legend days after the death of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot while sleeping in his Kansas City home.
President Trump continues to spare no resource in demanding law and order so every American child can grow up free from violence and fear. The recent significant increase in heinous crime is intolerable, and the Trump Administration will continue to dispatch federal agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshal Service, DEA, and ATF to work alongside state and local law enforcement officials in cities around the country to support our police, protect our streets, and save American lives.
 The following individuals are expected to attend:
 The White House President Donald J. Trump
 Trump Administration Attorney General William Barr, Department of Justice Acting Secretary Chad Wolf, Department of Homeland Security Acting Director Matt Albence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Regina Lombardo, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Acting Administrator Tim Shea, Drug Enforcement Administration Director Donald Washington, U.S. Marshals Service Director Christopher Wray, Federal Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director David Bowdich, Federal Bureau of Investigation US Attorney John Anderson, District of New Mexico US Attorney Tim Garrison, Western District of Missouri  US Attorney John Lausch, Northern District of Illinois
 External Participants Sheriff Manuel Gonzales III, Bernalillo County, New Mexico Chief Rick Smith, Chief of Police, Kansas City, Missouri Chief Leo Schmitz, Chief of Public Safety, Cook County Sheriff's Office Family of Vernado Jones, Jr. Family of LeGend Taliferro Family of Jacqueline Vigil
