    "Tonight in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton once again proved she is the candidate most qualified to deliver positive change for Americans starting on day one as president. Hillary has a 35-year record of delivering real, positive change for America's working families.
"Hillary spoke to what really matters most to Nevadans – giving voice to the concerns of the American people and laying out her vision for how we'll meet our most urgent challenges. On issue after issue, Hillary has stood with Nevadans, including her strong opposition to Yucca Mountain. Nevadans face so many challenges – from obtaining quality affordable health care, to providing education opportunities for their children, to the home foreclosure crisis. Nevadans know they can count on Hillary to stand up for them in the White House, and I hope Nevadans will join me in standing for her on January 19th."
