    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Michael Grebe.
"I am honored to have the support of such a committed Republican and outstanding citizen," said Mitt Romney.

His endorsement coming just days before next week's elections is significant, and his support will be important when we work to defeat President Obama in November."
Announcing his support, Michael Grebe said, "Wisconsin is looking for a change in Washington. We need a committed conservative and a man who can lead our country during times of economic stagnation at home and uncertainty around the world. Mitt Romney has demonstrated the characteristics of a true leader throughout his life whether it was in business, at the Olympics, or as governor. I am proud to support him and look forward to working on his behalf in the days before the primary and in the fall when we will defeat President Obama."
