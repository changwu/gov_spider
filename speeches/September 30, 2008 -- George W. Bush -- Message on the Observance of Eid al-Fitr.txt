    I send greetings to Muslims everywhere celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the Festival of Breaking the Fast.
During the three-day festival of Eid al-Fitr, Muslims celebrate the completion of their fast and the blessings of a renewed faith. On this special occasion, families and friends around the globe gather to share traditional foods and congratulate each other on meeting the test of Ramadan.
Our Nation has millions of citizens who practice Islam, and our country benefits from their many contributions. This holiday is also an opportunity for Muslims to reflect on Islam's vibrant culture, which has enriched civilization for centuries.
Laura and I send our best wishes. Eid Mubarak.
