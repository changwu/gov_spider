Script For "Symbols Of Hope": 
JOHN MCCAIN: Whether from Italy, Ireland, Mexico, or the Far East, too often, new immigrants have been treated as objects of fear, instead of symbols of hope.
My friends, I want to be clear.
I believe all immigrants are symbols of hope.
That's why when I'm President, addressing the immigration problem will be a priority.
We'll solve it with legislation that's practical and fair.
Fairness to all is the key to success.
I'm John McCain and I approved this message.
