    Laura and I are saddened by the death of our friend, Congressman Tom Lantos.
Tom was a man of character and a champion of human rights. After immigrating to America more than six decades ago, he worked to help oppressed people around the world have the opportunity to live in freedom. As the only Holocaust survivor to serve in Congress, Tom was a living reminder that we must never turn a blind eye to the suffering of the innocent at the hands of evil men. I appreciate his vision in cofounding the Human Rights Caucus. I also appreciate his efforts to protect our environment, alleviate the sufferings caused by HIV/AIDS, and strengthen our friendships and alliances around the globe.
We will miss Tom's leadership in the Halls of Congress. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Annette, their daughters, and the rest of the Lantos family.
