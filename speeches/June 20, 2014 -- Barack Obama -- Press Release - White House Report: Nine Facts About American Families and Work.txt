    On Monday, the President will host the first ever White House Summit on Working Families to spark a national conversation, keep making progress, and identify solutions that are good for both workers and employers - and that go right at the heart of the economic stresses and the emotional strains that families are going through. In order to stay competitive and economically successful, American businesses and our country as a whole need to bring our workplace policies into the 21st century.
In advance of the Summit, the Council of Economic Advisers released a report, Nine Facts About American Families and Work, that illustrates the changes that are needed to ensure our long-term economic growth, maintain our economic competiveness, improve the well-being of Americans, and make full use of America's talent. The report is linked above and also attached.
