    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Wilson (R) New Mexico and 13 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports prompt enactment of legislation to: (1) provide additional statutory authority for the Terrorist Surveillance Program; (2) modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) in light of changes in communications technology and the War on Terror; and (3) effectively protect cooperating private sector entities and U.S. personnel from liability as they carry out authorized and lawful U.S. communications intelligence activities to protect against terrorism. Accordingly, the Administration strongly supports House passage of
H.R. 5825 as amended, and looks forward to working with Congress to strengthen the bill as it moves through the legislative process.
