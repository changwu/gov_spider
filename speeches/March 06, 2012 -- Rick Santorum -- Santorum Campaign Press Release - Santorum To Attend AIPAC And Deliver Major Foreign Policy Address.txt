    Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum will leave the campaign trail for a few hours to deliver a major foreign policy address on U.S.-Israeli relations on Tuesday, March 6 at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference in Washington, DC. (AIPAC)
Senator Santorum believes that the mounting threats facing America and her ally Israel warrants the personal attention of presidential candidates who strive to be our next commander-in-chief. Senator Santorum served on the Senate Armed Services Committee for 8 years and was the author of the Syria Accountability Act, which imposed sanctions on Syria and helped push Syria out of Lebanon. Senator Santorum was also the author of the Iran Freedom and Support Act which authorized federal support for pro-democracy movements within Iran and imposed sanctions on the Iranian regime."
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "The most important role of our President is protecting America and her allies as Commander-in-Chief. Our next President must be prepared to deal with the international threats facing America on day-one, and foremost among them is the growing nuclear threat of Iran. Senator Santorum has been a staunch supporter of Israel and has been talking about the Iranian threat for years. He believes a candidate for President should lay out his clear vision to deal with this threat. While the campaign is important, Rick felt it he needed to attend the event in person as a sign to the world, that if elected, politics will never trump his Presidential responsibility."
