I have had brought to my attention your pending court action to evict 40 families. I will appreciate every possible effort being made to provide alternative temporary housing for these needy families without means to find other quarters. I understand the plight of some of those being evicted is most unfortunate and that they can still be provided for consistent with step-by-step private development of the property. In order to be of every possible assistance, I have today directed the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency that the loan previously approved for you to build new public housing facilities be made available promptly upon your optioning a site. In the midst of the present economic downturn and widespread unemployment, I hope that diligent efforts will be made in every community in the nation to avoid eviction of families genuinely in need and seeking to the extent of their means to meet their obligations. Understanding and real help is needed on their behalf by all of us.
