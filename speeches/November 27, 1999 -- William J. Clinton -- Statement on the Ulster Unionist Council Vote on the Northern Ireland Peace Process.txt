    I welcome this historic step toward lasting peace in Northern Ireland and congratulate David Trimble on his leadership in bringing about a successful vote in the Ulster Unionist Council. The Ulster Unionist decision today, which follows critical decisions by all the pro-agreement parties over the past several weeks, is an important move forward to full implementation of the Good Friday accord in all its aspects. Beginning next week, government in Northern Ireland is being put back directly in the hands of all the people. I welcome this progress and urge all parties to continue working together on building the foundations for lasting peace. I pledge the support of the United States to all those who are helping to make possible a brighter future for Northern Ireland.
