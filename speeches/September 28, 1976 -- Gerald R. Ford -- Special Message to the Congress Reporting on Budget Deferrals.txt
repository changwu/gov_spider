    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I report routine revisions to two deferrals previously transmitted.
A deferral for the higher education program of the Office of Education has been increased by $36.9 million. The Department of Defense's military construction deferral reflects a net increase of $3.9 million. The details of each revised deferral are contained in the attached reports.
