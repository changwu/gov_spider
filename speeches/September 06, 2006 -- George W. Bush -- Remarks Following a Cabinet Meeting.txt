    I want to thank my Cabinet for what has been a very fruitful discussion. I thank you for your continued service to our country. Congress is coming back into town, and we welcome them back, and we look forward to working with them on a variety of matters.
One of the most important tasks is for Congress to recognize that we need the tools necessary to win this war on terror, and we'll continue to discuss with Congress ways to make sure that this Nation is capable of defending herself.
Secondly, I recognize this is a political season. There's elections coming down the road, but I made sure the Cabinet understands that we'll continue to address the concerns of the American people. That's what the people expect us to do. And those concerns include being fiscally wise with the people's money. So when Congress starts appropriating money, we will continue to urge them to be wise with the people's money.
We talked about the economy; we talked about energy; we talked about health care and a variety of other matters. I'm looking forward to working with Congress, Members of both political parties, to do the job that the American people expect us to do.
Thank you.
