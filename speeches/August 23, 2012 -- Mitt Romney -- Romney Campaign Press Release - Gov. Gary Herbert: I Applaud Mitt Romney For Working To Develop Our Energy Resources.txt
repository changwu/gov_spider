    Utah Governor Gary Herbert made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"States must play a significant role in unleashing America's energy potential. Governor Romney's plan to achieve North American energy independence by 2020 is the perfect combination of bold leadership from the federal government coupled with increased local control. As governor of an energy-producing state, I understand the importance of responsibly developing our energy resources and I applaud Governor Romney for making this important issue a top priority."
