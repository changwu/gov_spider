    This has been one of the most pleasant and productive meetings that we've ever had. The expressions of friendship between our countries are genuine, and we share deep commitments to common goals and common purposes.
A constant reminder in the center of our Capital City of the vision and hope of our two peoples is expressed by the Otero sculpture, and I'm very grateful for it. This is a photograph, and I think that we will have in the future a chance to enjoy this for. many generations to come.
The discussions were compatible and harmonious, and the friendship that exists between our countries is absolutely unshakeable.
Thank you very much.
