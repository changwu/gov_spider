    New Television ad on the Air in New Hampshire
New Hampshire Governor Stephen Merrill reinforced the need for strong conservative leadership in a new, 30-second campaign television ad that began running in New Hampshire on Thursday.
"As we head into the home stretch of the Republican Presidential primary, New Hampshire residents must remember that the philosophy that has made us strong is the type of leadership that Senator Bob Dole has been delivering in his battle against Bill Clinton and his liberal agenda," said Governor Merrill. "It's not untested ideas like the tax plan of candidate Steven Forbes," added Merrill.
"Steven Forbes'income tax proposal will cost typical New Hampshire households $ 2,000 more in taxes and we will lose our property tax deduction and mortgage interest deduction. No candidate, Democrat or Republican, can come into New Hampshire and raise our taxes without fight from me," Merrill continued. "That's not the type of leadership New Hampshire residents need. We need someone in the White House who fight hard for a balanced budget that cuts taxes and cuts spending. That person is Senator Bob Dole."
"I'm proud to be a Bob Dole supporter because he's fighting for New Hampshire taxpayers. He has my full supports," Merrill concluded.
