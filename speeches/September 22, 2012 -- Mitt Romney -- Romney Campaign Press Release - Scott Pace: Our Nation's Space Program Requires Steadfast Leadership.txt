    Scott Pace, Chairman of the Romney Space Policy Advisory Group, released the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for Securing U.S. Leadership in Space:
"We have enjoyed a half-century of leadership in space, but that leadership is eroding due to multiple policy and management mistakes by the current Administration. Our nation's space efforts require clear, decisive, and steadfast leadership to determine exactly where we are going and the larger purposes behind our space program in support of vital national interests.  A Romney Administration will provide the steadiness of purpose, coherence, and bipartisan support that our nation's space community needs and deserves."
