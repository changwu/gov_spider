    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Helms (R) North Carolina and 3 others)
As the President has often stated, the Administration strongly supports voluntary prayer in public schools. The Administration urges, however, the enactment of S.J. Res. 3 in lieu of S. 47.
In contrast with S. 47, which would bar the Supreme Court and Federal district courts from reviewing school prayer cases,
S.J. Res. 3 would: (1) state that nothing in the Constitution prohibits spoken or silent prayers by individuals or groups in public institutions; (2) guarantee that no individual would be required to participate in prayer; and (3) prohibit the Federal or State governments from composing any prayer to be recited in public schools.
