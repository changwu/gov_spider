FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Advances National Security Norms in Space
New U.S. Commitment on Destructive Direct-Ascent Anti-Satellite Missile Testing
Today at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the United States commits not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing, and that the United States seeks to establish this as a new international norm for responsible behavior in space. The Vice President also called on other nations to make similar commitments and to work together in establishing this as a norm, making the case that such efforts benefit all nations.
At the Biden-Harris Administration's first National Space Council meeting in December, Vice President Harris tasked the National Security Council staff to work with the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and other national security agencies to develop proposals for national security space norms that advance U.S. interests and preserve the security and sustainability of space. The commitment announced today is the first initiative under this effort. The United States is the first nation to make such a declaration.
This commitment addresses one of the most pressing threats to the security and sustainability of space, as demonstrated by Russia's November 2021 destructive direct­ascent ASAT missile test. The People's Republic of China conducted a similar test in 2007. The destruction of space objects through direct-ascent ASAT missile testing is reckless and irresponsible. The long-lived debris created by these tests now threaten satellites and other space objects that are vital to all nations' security, economic, and scientific interests, and increases risk to astronauts in space. Overall, these tests jeopardize the long-term sustainability of outer space and imperil the exploration and use of space by all nations.
Developing a shared understanding of what constitutes safe and responsible space activities contributes to a more stable space environment by reducing the risk of miscommunication and miscalculation. This is especially important as there is an ever-increasing number of states and non-governmental entities that rely on space services and space assets which are vulnerable to debris.
This new commitment also protects U.S. interests in space. Meaningfully reducing ASAT testing and debris generation advances U.S. national security interests and protects long-term U.S. interests in space exploration, space science, and space-enabled economic development.
Conflict or confrontation in outer space is not inevitable, and the United States seeks to ensure outer space remains free from conflict. The Biden-Harris Administration had made clear that the United States will engage the international community to uphold and strengthen a rules-based international order for space. The United States, working with commercial industry, allies, and partners, will lead in the development of new measures that contribute to the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of space activities. Overall, through this new commitment and other actions, the United States will demonstrate how space activities can be conducted in a responsible, peaceful, and sustainable manner.
EMBARGOED UNTIL APRIL 18, 2022 8:00 PM EASTERN / 5:00 PM PACIFIC
On Background attributed to a White House Official: 

The visit to Vandenberg Space Force Base demonstrates the Vice President's continued engagement on space and puts a focus on her work at the intersection of national security and space.


At the first National Space Council meeting under this Administration last December, the Vice President emphasized the national security aspects of space and publicly condemned recent Russian actions:

"Just last month, we saw what can happen. Russia launched an anti-satellite missile to destroy one of its satellites. By blasting debris across space, this irresponsible act endangered the satellites of other nations, as well as astronauts in the International Space Station."


The Biden-Harris Administration's Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request includes the largest single increase in our military space capabilities in the nation's history ($24.5B request). This reflects the Administration's focus on national security and to ensure the Department of Defense has a resilient space architecture in the face of growing threats to our space enterprise.

VP Focus on Establishing Rules and Norms in Space

As Chair, the Vice President has put her personal stamp on the National Space Council.


One of her top areas of focus on the Space Council is advancing norms for peaceful and responsible behavior in space. This is part of her broader effort on national security to rally the world in establishing rules and norms for new and emerging challenges in the 21st century and ensure the rules of the road align with our interests and values.


At the National Space Council meeting in December, the establishment of norms for space was one of her major topics of discussion and the Vice President emphasized that the U.S. must lead the world in establishing and expanding rules and norms that govern space.


At the National Space Council meeting in December, she said:

"Without clear norms for the responsible use of space, we stand the real risk of threats to our national and global security."


"As activity in space grows, we must reaffirm, yes, the rights of all nations and we must demand responsibility from all space-faring nations. We must establish and expand rules and norms on safety and security, on transparency and cooperation to include military, commercial, and civil space activity."



VP Leadership of National Space Council
On December 1, 2021, the Vice President launched the U.S. Space Priorities Framework.

The Framework emphasized that burgeoning U.S. space activities are a source of American strength at home and abroad – from providing tangible economic and societal benefits to Americans to expanding our network of alliances and partnerships.


The Framework also directed that the United States will bolster the health and vitality of our space sectors – civil, commercial, and national security – for the benefit of the American people and leverage that strength to lead the international community in preserving the benefits of space for future generations.


With regards to national security, the Framework noted that the United States will defend its national security interests from the growing scope and scale of space and counterspace threats. Confrontation or conflict, however, is not inevitable. To deter aggression against U.S., allied, and partner interests in a manner that contributes to strategic stability, the United States will accelerate its transition to a more resilient national security space posture and strengthen its ability to detect and attribute hostile acts in space. U.S. national security space operations will continue to comply with applicable international law and demonstrate leadership in both the responsible use of space and stewardship of the space environment.


Additionally, the Framework directs that the United States will lead in strengthening global governance of space activities. The United States will engage the international community to uphold and strengthen a rules-based international order for space. The United States, working with commercial industry, allies, and partners, will promote the implementation of existing measures and lead in the development of new measures that contribute to the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of space activities. The United States will demonstrate how space activities can be conducted in a responsible, peaceful, and sustainable manner.

On December 1, 2021, the Vice President chaired the first National Space Council meeting in the Biden-Harris Administration. During the meeting, Council members discussed the following:

Addressing opportunities and challenges in expanding, accelerating, and building rules and norms to govern space. In particular, members directed the United States to lead efforts to expand global governance of space.


Building on President Biden's all-of-government approach to the climate crisis. Council members discussed how earth observation data from space can be used to respond to the climate crisis. In particular, members directed increased availability of and access to space data.


To compete in the 21st century, the United States requires a strong STEM workforce. The Council members discussed the needs of the civil, commercial, and national security space workforce and how the Space Council can help remove barriers to entering into and staying in the space workforce.

Artemis Accords and Foreign Engagements on Space
The Artemis Accords are a set of norms and principles that promote values-based cooperation and encourage responsible and safe behavior in space. Currently 18 countries have signed the Accords: Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
The following nine countries have joined since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration in part thanks to the Vice President's leadership efforts: Brazil, Bahrain, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, and Singapore.
In her engagements with foreign leaders, the Vice President regularly raises space issues, advances our cooperation on space issues with allies and partners, and has rallied countries to establish rules and norms for responsible behavior in space. Below are some examples.

SINGAPORE: In August 2021, during her trip to Singapore, Vice President urged Singapore to join the Artemis Accords. Singapore joined in March 2022 and she and Prime Minister Lee welcomed it during his visit to Washington. While she was in Singapore, she and Prime Minister Lee agreed to create a bilateral dialogue on space.


VIETNAM: During the Vice President's August 2021 visit to Hanoi, Vietnam the U.S. and Vietnam acknowledged the important role international cooperation plays in sustained the outer space environment, and committed to a civil space dialogue, which subsequently met.


FRANCE: Following the Vice President's meeting with President Macron in Paris in November 2021, the U.S. and France announced a Comprehensive Dialogue on Space to ensure a whole-of-government approach to space cooperation. The Vice President also announced that the U.S. is committed to joining the Space Climate Observatory (SCO). SCO is intended to sponsor projects that help make data from space accessible to local entities to inform decisions and measures to mitigate and respond to the climate crisis. France committed to signing the Artemis Accords.


MEXICO: In November 2021, Vice President Harris met with President Lopez Obrador and urged Mexico to join the Artemis accords. Mexico joined in December 2021.


BAHRAIN: As part of the Crown Prince of Bahrain's visit to Washington and meeting with the Vice President in March 2022, Bahrain joined the Artemis Accords.


ROMANIA: As part of the Vice President's visit to Bucharest, Romania in March 2022, the Vice President and President Iohannis exchanged views on the Artemis Accords and welcomed Romania joining.

Other Public Engagements

Visit to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (November 2021): The Vice President met with leaders from NASA, NOAA, and USGS to underscore how the U.S. is harnessing the space program to combat the climate crisis and protect vulnerable communities.


Visit to Hampton University (September2021): The Vice President visited the only HBCU to run a NASA mission, the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite mission. She met with researchers and students leading work connecting space and STEM education.


Engagements with Astronauts: The Vice President has engaged with NASA Astronauts on earth and aboard the International Space Station, including Mark Vande Hei, Victor Glover, and Shannon Walker, and Katie Rubins.
Background on the National Space Council

The National Space Council (NSpC) is the White House policy council responsible for ensuring the United States capitalizes on the rich opportunities presented by our nations' space activities. Under the leadership of its chair, Vice President Kamala Harris, the NSpC advises and assists the President on the development and implementation of space policy and strategy and is comprised of Cabinet-level Secretaries and other senior executive branch officials.

 

The NSpC integrates the civil, commercial, and national security space activities of the United States to advance the broader priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration. Space capabilities underpin fundamental elements of our society, from education and science to security and economic prosperity. The United States leverages space capabilities to better understand the Earth and its climate, explore the universe, create commercial opportunities, and strengthen security and international partnerships. There is more activity in space today than at any point in history, and the participants in this fast-developing domain are diverse and expanding: nations with long-standing experience, countries seeking access to space, innovative and ambitious companies, research institutions, and users of space services from across the United States and the world.

VP travel pool report #5: Unclassified briefing remarks
Pool was ushered into the Combined Space Operation Center to a room on the second floor with three large screens showing promotional footage and DoD's 11 combatant commands. Two smaller screens featured world maps and Timezones.
Around 20 service members and officials were inside awaiting the VP, who entered at 3:15pm. Pool was not allowed inside with phones or recorders for the unclassified portion of the briefing.
Harris gave opening remarks about space being one of her main area focuses and praised Space Force officials as "leaders not only within the nation but worldwide."
She said the work that happens here really is about creating a standard of exceptionalism and "being a role model for the world" in terms of space.
General Dickinson, Commander of US Space Command, explained the origins of Space Force, where it falls in the combatant commands of DoD and how it works with other space and defense related agencies. Harris briefing mistook another service member for Dickinson before he began.
Harris then listened as Maj. General Burt, Commander of the Combine Force Space Component Command, spoke about DoD's interagency partnerships with Space Force (Reconnaissance, NASA, Dept of Commerce). She explained how it helps NASA astronauts take off and return to Earth safely and working with other countries on information sharing.
Burt said they would talk about tabletop exercises, a variety of missions and more on Russia's actions in November (an apparent reference to Russia's launch of an anti-satellite missile) during the classified part of the briefing.
Before pool was ushered out, Harris asked Burt to explain why this impacts the lives of Americans. Burt said Americans rely on the precision of Space Force and the agency helps with cell service, navigation, wildfire support and dealing with natural disasters.
"Forces depend on it," she said, adding Space Force is "definitely something everyone relies on."
Pool was ushered out as Dickinson was speaking at 3:28pm local time and loaded into the vans. On the way back to the vans pool spotted SG waiting in the motorcade.
We are now holding in the vans and waiting for the briefing to end before heading over to the remarks. We are expected to hold there for an hour as Harris meets with service members.

Harris took the stage at 5:17pm and finished her remarks at 5:31 pm. Please check quotes.
She announced the US commits to not conduct direct-ascent anti satellite missile testing (see earlier embargoed fact sheet)
"These tests, to be sure, are reckless and they are irresponsible. These tests also put in danger so much of what we do in space."
She said Russia's tests like the one in November are part of their efforts to develop anti-satellite weapons systems and an attempt to deny the US our ability to use our space capabilities by destroying our satellites.
"We must write the new norms of the road," she said.
More TK. Pool was ushered out and motorcade rolling at 5:37 PT.

VP travel pool report #11 - DNC fundraiser remarks
Pool walked up a tree-lined driveway and held on the side of the house before being escorted back for the VP's remarks.
About 30 people were in attendance for the fundraiser. Matt Walden gave opening remarks and noted the small group was able to raise $1 million dollars tonight.
He introduced SG, noting the two have been friends for almost 35 years. "Doug was formidable and a force of nature even back then," he said. "the way that he is embraced and fulfilled in his role as a second gentleman makes me so so proud to call one of my closest friends."
"It's good to be home. It is so good to be back in California. Back in our neighborhood among so many amazing friends, family," Emhoff said.
He noted he's only SGOTUS because the country was "smart enough to elect the first female Vice President."
Says he misses California but "But to be able to leave something that I love so much to do something so important for our country is truly truly, truly humbling."
Says he approaches midterms with "huge sense of optimism and confidence and joy, because we're on the right side of so many issues and we will continue to be on the right side of so many issues and I'm not going to stop. I'm going to keep fighting and keep working until we get this job done."
He accidentally introduces Harris as "our wife" before correcting himself and noting that he's been at it since the Easter Egg roll this morning in DC.
Harris started speaking at 7:58pm by praising her husband. She noted last year he made 35 trips on behalf of the administration.
She says Emhoff " is really lifting up the voice of what it means to be a partner to someone regardless of gender."
"And he's been doing it in a way that is really very, I think important and special. There's so many young men and women who have been watching how he does it as a model of how we can think about relationships and partnerships."

VP travel pool reports #12 - More DNC remarks
Harris thanked Dana, whom she said has been a friend for decades. Pool spotted Ryan Murphy, JJ Abrams and Reggie Hudlin among the guests.
Harris moved into remarks on what Democrats stand for and are achieving.
"there's so much that we stand for that never has been nor will it ever be easy to achieve," she said.
"In fact, I dare say, as a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement, there's never been any substantial or significant progress that our country has made That did not involve a fight did not involve hard work did not involve extraordinary forces that seemed to be working against that progress."
What do Democrats stand for?"That each of us is equal, regardless of gender, Background religion. We stand for the principle that, given that we are all equal, we should be treated that way.
"Each of our policies are fueled with that perspective, including being guided by not only the importance of equality but of equity."
She notes the administration's focus on pay equity and highlighting the specific needs of women in the workforce over the course of the pandemic - including that childcare shouldn't be so expensive.
"We stand for a healthcare system that is informed with the understanding that access to affordable health care should be a right," she said, pointing to expansion of the Affordable Care Act, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and unburdening those overwhelmed by medical debt.
She says we stand for women's rights, when it comes to what should be a non-negotiable Understanding and Right of women to make decisions about their own body, including their reproductive health and choice.
Says it's time to "remind people of the optimism that we bring to everything that we stand for and everything we know is achievable."
"It means reminding people as the Democratic Party of what we have achieved and accomplished."
She notes she's been to Europe three times in recent months as part of the administration's efforts to strengthen NATO partnerships.
She acknowledges the economy hardships. "Now, yeah it costs more money at the pump, and we need to deal with that we need to acknowledge but we also need to keep with our program around making it easier to get by day to day which means again, going back to the childcare, which means bringing down the cost of living means looking at what we have an investment in affordable housing what we should do in terms of bringing down the cost of prescription drugs."
But she said Democrats will need to remind people why they should vote in Nov - echoing remarks she made at last week's DNC fundraiser in DC.
"You put in an order, you said I want certain things to happen," she said, pointing to accomplishments including the Child Tax Credit, "which has meant that at least in the first year we reduce child poverty."
She pointed to Biden fulfilling his promise to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court.
"You want an administration that's going to bring back the world community - you got it. You want the creation of jobs. You want a vaccine that's going to be distributed to all people, you want the schools to be reopened: check check check."
"So when when you made the effort, when we did the emailing and the calling and the texting and the knocking on doors, it mattered. Elections matter. And so as we go toward this next election, let's remind people that it matters, and that we are so well aware of the work that we still have yet to do."
She said she's approaching the midterms with "a great sense of optimism."
"And we don't have to any time to slow down. You don't have any time to doubt ourselves. We gotta get to work."
The VP finished speaking at 8:17pm for a total of 19 minutes. Pool was escorted back to the press vans immediately after.
Motorcade is rolling for RON at 8:33pm local time.
