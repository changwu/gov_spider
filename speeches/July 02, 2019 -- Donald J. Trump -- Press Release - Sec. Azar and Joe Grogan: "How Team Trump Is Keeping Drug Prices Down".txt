He wants to hold providers and Big Pharma accountable to transparency and reasonable prices. We are working every day to protect American patients and deliver on the president's vision."
How Team Trump Is Keeping Drug Prices DownBy Secretary Alex Azar and Joe GroganNew York PostJuly 1, 2019
At some point, almost all Americans have been stuck with massive, unexpected medical bills or forced to make health decisions without real information or anyone to guide them. We have worked at the highest levels of US health care for years, yet it has happened to both of us.
