Last night, Marco's communications director, Alex Conant, laid out on Fox News how the campaign views the race:

Some of the key takeaways:
1. Donald Trump didn't come out a winner: By Sunday, he'd drawn less than 30 percent of the delegates possible this weekend, despite investing heavily in these states.
2. Marco's tough line on Trump worked: Republicans and conservatives are rejecting a con artist.
3. Delegates matter going forward: No one is currently on track to winning the 1,237 delegates needed.
4. The map favors Marco: He's beaten Ted Cruz in a number of states Cruz expected to dominate, while states to come are more Marco-friendly.
Marco is well-positioned to win more and more delegates in the races to come and unite the party.
