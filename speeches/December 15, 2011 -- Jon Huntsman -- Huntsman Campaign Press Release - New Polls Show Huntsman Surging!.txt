We have exciting news to share.
A newly released Suffolk University poll shows Governor Huntsman surging in New Hampshire, jumping into third place with 13 percent of the vote.
This poll confirms that Governor Huntsman's message of restoring trust in Washington, ending bailouts for too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks, and eliminating crony capitalism is resonating with voters who are fed up with politics-as-usual in Washington.
This comes on the heels of a new Wall Street Journal poll that shows Governor Huntsman's support steadily rising across the nation. The American people are desperately searching for a principled leader who can unite Republicans and Independents to defeat Barack Obama next November. As the L.A. Times noted earlier today, people are now beginning to recognize Jon Huntsman as that leader.
Now we need the resources to defeat Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney.
We are launching a new fundraising push and asking all of our supporters to make an immediate donation of $10, $25, $50 or more to help our campaign reach our goal.
Your immediate donation will help us take advantage of our rising poll numbers and give us the resources we need to set up phone banks, contact voters and distribute campaign literature across New Hampshire. Please click here to help make a difference at this critical moment.
Thank you for your continued support of Governor Huntsman!
Standing proudly with Jon Huntsman,
Matt David
Campaign Manager
