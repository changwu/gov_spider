    In February, I submitted to the Congress a major plan to reorganize the Federal Government's equal employment opportunity enforcement activities. The plan offers a good example of how reorganization can both improve Government competence and also reduce its unnecessary burden on the American people.
The need to reorganize our equal employment programs has been long recognized by both civil rights and business groups alike. Since 1941, when President Roosevelt issued the first Executive order to forbid employment discrimination in the Federal Government, our Nation has taken historic steps to extend equal employment opportunity throughout the private, as well as the public sector.
Each new prohibition has unfortunately brought with it a further fragmentation of administrative responsibility and management. A large number of different departments and agencies have become involved, resulting in needless confusion, paperwork, duplication, and delay.
Under special reorganization authority adopted by Congress last year, the reorganization plan I submitted in February goes into effect today. It replaces a chaotic picture with a coherent and sensible structure.
It will improve enforcement of equal employment opportunities and reduce the burden of equal employment enforcement on business by consolidating the number of agencies involved in this area.
