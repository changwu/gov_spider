    First Lady Melania Trump spent quality time today with several children from the Girls and Boys Club of Greater Washington, FBR Clubhouse in Ward 8. The children's ages ranged from 10 to 11 years old. Along with the National Park Service (NPS), which maintains the White House grounds, the group spent time in the White House Kitchen Garden learning about the importance of the outdoors and healthy eating. After a tutorial from the NPS on how to harvest and plant, as well as history on the Kitchen Garden and the White House beehive, the First Lady spoke with the children about their own gardens at home and what vegetables they enjoy.
Mrs. Trump stated, "Healthy, nurturing, and positive environments are instrumental in enhancing the well-being and mindfulness of all children. They learn so much through their surroundings and the White House Kitchen Garden is a prime example of how children can enjoy the outdoors and learn about healthy eating and living, while also gaining an understanding of the White House and it's rich history. I was so happy to be able to celebrate healthy living through fun activities with these special children today, and I look forward to future events in the garden."
