    Thank you very much, Rita, Mrs. Shouse, and all of the wonderful supporters of Wolf Trap:
It is a great honor and a wonderful privilege for me to be here and pay tribute to Mrs. Shouse. Those of us who have seen the development of Wolf Trap over the years know how many people from all walks of life have contributed, not only within the United States but the friends of the United States all over the world.
But Kay Shouse has epitomized Wolf Trap. Wolf Trap means a great deal to her, but Wolf Trap means a great deal to all of us and will mean a great deal to literally millions of people for years and years to come.
And let me just say that those of us who have known you and had the opportunity, Kay, to be the beneficiaries of your wonderful personality, your gracious hospitality, and your superb generosity to not only this area but around the world, are deeply grateful to have an opportunity tonight to pay tribute on an anniversary--I won't mention which one it is. [Laughter] But it is not the years that count, it is the spirit and the vision and the future.
And so, may I ask all of us to join in a toast to Kay Shouse, who represents the future, but who has built a wonderful present for all of us and those to come in the future.
To Kay Shouse.
