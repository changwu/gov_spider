    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Owens (D) NY)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the discretionary programs under the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA). These programs support a variety of important research, demonstration, and training activities that help to strengthen services under the Act's State grant programs for children with disabilities.
The Administration also supports the bill's goals of:

Ensuring that minority children with disabilities are fully and effectively served.

Increasing the ability of institutions and organizations that have not previously participated in the EHA programs to compete for awards under those programs.

Expanding the scope of the reauthorized programs to complement and support related programs.

The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 1013, but will work in conference to address problems with H.R. 1013, including:

Preferences for certain individuals, schools, or organizations solely on the basis of their minority group status, which the Department of Justice advises are unconstitutional.

Creation of a new program for children and youth with serious emotional disturbances. Existing programs already address their needs.

Earmarking funds for information and evaluation activities without regard to the amount actually needed for such purposes.
