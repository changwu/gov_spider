    This NATO Summit meeting is, as the resolution states, the "capstone of efforts to ensure that the needs of collective security will be met over the next decade." For almost 30 years, NATO has "preserved the peace... allowing its members to attain unprecedented levels of prosperity and well-being for their people."
We look forward to meeting the challenges of the future, confident of our Alliance and sure of our people's support for it. This resolution reaffirms that NATO will continue to enjoy the broad, bipartisan backing from Congress that it has always had. This administration will join with the Congress—in the words of the resolution—"to reaffirm the unity of the North Atlantic Alliance, to strengthen its defensive capabilities to meet threats to the peace, and on this basis to persevere in attempts to lessen tensions with the Warsaw Pact States."
