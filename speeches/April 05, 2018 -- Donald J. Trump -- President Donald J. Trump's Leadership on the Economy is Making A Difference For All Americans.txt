TAX CUTS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND BEYOND: Americans are seeing the benefits of President Trump's tax cuts.

According to the Ernst & Young Tax Reform Dollar Deployment Survey, 89 percent of companies plan to enhance compensation due to the new tax reform law.


Americans are beginning to see the impact of tax cuts on every paycheck.
