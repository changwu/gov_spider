    The President is deeply gratified by the vote of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to favorably report the SALT II treaty to the Senate floor. We are particularly grateful for the thoroughness with which the committee has explored all aspects of the treaty.
The President would like to express special appreciation to Senators Church and Javits for their leadership during the extended hearings and markup of SALT II.
It is the President's hope that all Senators will explore the SALT II treaty and related issues with the same intensity as the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We believe after such study Senators will reach the conclusion that SALT II is in the best interests of the United States and will vote to ratify the treaty.
