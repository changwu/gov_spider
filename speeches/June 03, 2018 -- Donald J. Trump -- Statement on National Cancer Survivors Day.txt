    During National Cancer Survivors Day, our Nation celebrates the lives of millions of Americans who have battled cancer. Together, we honor the survivors across our country who have overcome many challenges on their journeys to restored health, and we renew our commitment to finding a cure for cancer.
In February, I had the pleasure of meeting with Donald Bouvet, a bladder cancer survivor who was diagnosed in 2006. After Donald learned this devastating news, beating cancer became his full-time mission. For 11 years, Donald underwent surgery and chemotherapy, which took a toll both on Donald and those who stood by him the entire way.
Thankfully, Donald is in remission, and he regularly sees a doctor to ensure he remains cancer-free. He is one of nearly 16 million cancer survivors in the United States. We are inspired by the stories of these survivors, whose every breath helps to renew a sense of confidence that millions of cancer patients can and will beat this terrible disease.
There is great promise for a future of improved health for many Americans battling cancer, but still, the National Cancer Institute estimates that more than half a million Americans will die from cancer in 2018. To provide even greater hope for these Americans and their families, I recently signed into law the Federal "right to try" legislation. This new law gives those facing a terminal illness Health and medical care : Experimental drugs and therapiesexpanded options for care and treatments that could save their lives.
Melania and I pray for the full recovery of all who are battling cancer. We also express our great appreciation for the dedicated researchers and medical professionals who are making survivorship a reality for millions. Thanks to their hard work, we celebrate this special day among friends, family, and loved ones whose lives are a testament to the enduring spirit of the American people.
