    On February 21, 1977, the President signed Enrolled Resolution H.J. Res. 240, which provides temporary waivers of certain provisions of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976.
That act established a 200-mile fishery conservation zone effective March 1, 1977. The act prohibits fishing within this zone by foreign vessels after that date unless the foreign nation concerned has completed a Governing International Fishery Agreement with the United States.
Since enactment of the legislation, it has proven impossible to complete negotiations on all agreements in time for an orderly transition on March 1 from the present 12-mile fishing zone to the new 200-mile limit.
The effect of the waivers, most of which deal with time periods set for various phases of negotiating agreements, is to make it possible to conclude agreements by March 1, facilitating the implementation of the act.
