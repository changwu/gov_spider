    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of its Florida Hispanic Coalition. The coalition includes respected political, business and community leaders.
"John McCain has always been a strong advocate for Hispanics in Florida and across our nation," said Senator Mel Martinez. "John McCain recognizes the value and contributions Hispanics have made in America. He is someone who has always put this country first, and that's why he has my full support. The support of this coalition reflects his deep commitment to our community."
Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen added, "As the first Hispanic woman elected to the United States Congress, I know first-hand the inspiration John McCain has provided to all Latinos. He is a patriot who strongly believes in the values that are important to our community."
Today, John McCain addresses the 25th annual National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) in Washington, D.C., and next week he will make a historic trip to Colombia and Mexico.
