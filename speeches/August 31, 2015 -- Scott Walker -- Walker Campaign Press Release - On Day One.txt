    New York, N.Y. -- Governor Scott Walker released a new web video today highlighting his commitment, in contrast to other candidates, to terminating the bad Obama-Clinton nuclear deal with Iran on his first day as president. LifeZette highlighted the video last night, and it can also be seen here: http://bit.ly/1JqAhVD
As Walker says, "I refuse to live with a deal that threatens our safety and that of our closest allies. See, unlike others, I don't need months or years to mull this over. If Congress fails to stop the nuclear deal, I will terminate it on day one."
"American leadership is back, and together with our allies, we will not surrender another inch of ground. America will not be intimidated, and neither will I."
