    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Udall (D) Arizona and Sharp (D) Indiana)
The Administration strongly supports reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act, H.R. 1414, as passed by the House on July 30, 1987. Renewal of Price-Anderson is critical to the future of nuclear power in the United States and to federally-sponsored nuclear research and national security activities.
The Administration opposes, however, the bill's provision that could,provide Federal Tort Claims Act protection for nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturers.
