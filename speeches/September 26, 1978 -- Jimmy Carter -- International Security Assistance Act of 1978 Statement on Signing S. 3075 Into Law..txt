    I am pleased to be able to take the action authorized by the International Security Assistance Act to fully terminate the force and effect of the embargo on arms transfers to Turkey.
The Nation is well served by the prudent decision of Congress which makes this action possible. With the removal of these restrictions, the United States will be better able to accomplish its goals in the vital Eastern Mediterranean region: to improve our bilateral relationships with Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus; to strengthen NATO's southern flank; and to help promote a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem. In this effort to encourage the restoration of a stable and peaceful atmosphere in the Eastern Mediterranean, we will be fully guided by the principles set forth in the act.
This action will enable us to resume full military cooperation with Turkey and begin a new chapter in our relationship with Turkey. This relationship is important not only because of our mutual security concerns but also because of our shared commitment to democracy.
