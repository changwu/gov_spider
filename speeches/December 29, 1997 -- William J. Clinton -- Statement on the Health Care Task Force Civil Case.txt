    While the Department of Justice is still reviewing whether to appeal Judge Lamberth's ruling, I am quite confident that Mr. Magaziner acted appropriately. Any suggestion to the contrary is unfair and unsupported by the facts and the findings of the U.S. Attorney's Office in its 1995 investigation of this matter.
The U.S. Attorney's Office concluded that "there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Magaziner committed a criminal offense in this matter. There is no significant evidence that his declaration was factually false, much less that it was willfully and intentionally so."
Mr. Magaziner is, and will remain, a valued member of my administration.
