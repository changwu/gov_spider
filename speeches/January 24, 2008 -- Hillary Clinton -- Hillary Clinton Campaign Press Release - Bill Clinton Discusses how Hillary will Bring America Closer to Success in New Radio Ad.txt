WJC: This is Bill Clinton. These are tough economic times. There aren't enough jobs, health care costs and gas prices are soaring, and now millions of people are worried about losing their homes.
The question is what to do about it. You've got a great decision to make, but I believe it's Hillary who can help solve these problems.
I also know that African Americans have been hit the hardest these last seven years. Who can fix health care, who can fix our economy, who can create new jobs, who can reduce the price of gas at the pump?
Hillary can. I've known her for 36 years. When it comes to seeing a problem and figuring out how to solve it, she's the best I've ever seen.
She's always heard your voice and you'll be heard in the White House.
I want to thank you for twice giving me the chance to serve as president. The 1990s were a time of prosperity. We created more than 22 million new jobs, moved eight million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around.
It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again. I know Hillary's the one that can do it.
ANNCR: Paid for by Hillary Clinton for President.
HRC: I'm Hillary Clinton, candidate for president, and I approve this message.
