    I am pleased Congress has reached an agreement on counterterrorism legislation that will give our law enforcement officials the tools and resources necessary to disrupt, weaken, and defeat terrorists. I look forward to signing this strong bipartisan plan into law so that we can combat terrorism and prevent future attacks.
