    SPRINGFIELD, ILL. -- Governor Jim Edgar today urged presidential candidate Steve Forbes to join Senator Bob Dole in releasing detailed records of his finances.
"Those of us in public office, and those who seek public office, have a duty to the voters of this country to fully and publicly disclose our finances," Edgar said. "Public scrutiny is part of the trust we must hold with the voters. Here in Illinois, I have consistently released copies of my income tax returns since I became a public official. Bob Dole has gone further than any other Presidential candidate in releasing nearly three decades of tax information."
Edgar added, "Right now, Steve Forbes is the only person who knows what is in his personal income tax returns. He has never faced the scrutiny of the public. Until he releases his financial information, there will be questions in the public's mind, which is not in his best interest. I urge him to publicly disclose his tax returns, as has every other Presidential candidate from either party for the last 20 years. The public deserves and expects no less."
