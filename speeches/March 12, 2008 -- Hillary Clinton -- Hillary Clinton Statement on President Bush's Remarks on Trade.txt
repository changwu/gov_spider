    "We don't need lectures on trade from a President who has turned back the clock on worker and environmental protections, allowed our trade deficit to skyrocket and stood idly by while countries like China unfairly manipulate their currency and dump products like steel on the U.S. market. In fact, the reason we so desperately need to take a timeout from new trade agreements is to put a stop to the Bush Administration's reckless and destructive trade policies, and to chart a new course on trade policy for the 21st Century that is genuinely pro-worker and pro-American.
We also need a President who is truly committed to fixing NAFTA. I have said that I will renegotiate NAFTA, and have a specific 4-part plan to get it done. My opponent told the voters of Ohio that he wanted to fix NAFTA too, but his top economic advisor told the Canadian government that was just "political positioning," not a real policy commitment."
