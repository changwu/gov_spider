    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dymally (D) California)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2854, because existing law and regulations already provide an adequate and workable appeals mechanism for non-veteran Postal Service managerial and supervisory employees that provides protections similar to those proposed by the bill.
