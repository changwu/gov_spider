    Vice President Joe Biden spoke today with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine. President Poroshenko told the Vice President that the Ukrainian government had proposed multiple venues -- in Ukraine, in Russia, as well as other countries -- for negotiating a ceasefire with the pro-Russian separatists, but that all of these offers were refused either by Russia or the separatists. The Vice President welcomed Ukraine's continued efforts to negotiate a ceasefire as well as a roadmap for implementing President Poroshenko's peace plan in an effort to put Ukraine on a long-term path to stability. The Vice President told President Poroshenko that the United States was discussing with its partners in the international community the need to hold Russia accountable for its continued support for the separatists, including its provision of heavy weapons and equipment across the border. The Vice President agreed with President Poroshenko on the need to quickly put in place an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) border monitoring mission in Ukraine that could potentially be expanded to monitor a future ceasefire, and on the need for the immediate release of Ukrainian hostages held by the separatists.
