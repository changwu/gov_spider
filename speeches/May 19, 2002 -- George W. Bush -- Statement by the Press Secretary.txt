    The Administration warmly welcomes Friday's 85-6 vote in the Senate approving the Freedom Consolidation Act. The measure previously had passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives.
This vote is a strong show of support for NATO enlargement, one of the President's priorities for the NATO Summit in Prague this November, and an essential element of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. We thank the bill's sponsors and all those who worked hard on achieving this result.
