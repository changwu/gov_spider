    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement:
"Elizabeth and I will honor the members of the Writers Guild of America who are on strike at 'The View' by canceling our appearance on the show next week. I call on all of my fellow candidates and their campaigns to do the same.
"In addition, we will also honor any picket lines at CBS News, up to and including the CBS presidential debate on December 10th. As I said when I walked the WGA picket line in California last Friday, these workers are making a simple request for their fair share of the huge profits being made by multinational media corporations.
"I am a strong believer in collective bargaining, and I hope that in each of these disputes, management and the union are able to agree on a just settlement. But until those settlements are reached, I will stand firmly with these workers in their fight for a better life."
