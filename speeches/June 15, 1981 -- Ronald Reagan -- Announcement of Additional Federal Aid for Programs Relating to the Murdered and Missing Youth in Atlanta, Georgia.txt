    The President today is announcing the approval of $1.160 million for the Safe Summer Parks and Recreation Program for Atlanta, Fulton and DeKalb Counties, Ga. This brings to a total of $4.1 million that the Federal Government has provided Atlanta in the situation regarding the number of young people that are missing or dead.
[The President said,] "The people of Atlanta and the surrounding communities have endured grief and suffering in a manner that touches the hearts and minds and souls of millions of our countrymen. The American people are united in a collective effort to bring an end to this devastation of human life, to eliminate family suffering, and to restore a new spirit to a beleaguered community."
