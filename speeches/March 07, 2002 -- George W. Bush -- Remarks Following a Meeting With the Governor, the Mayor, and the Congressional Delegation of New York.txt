    Thank you all very much for coming. As you can see, I'm standing with the mighty—and I emphasize "mighty"—New York delegation. Right after the September the 11th tragedy, I made a pledge to Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton, Governor Pataki, the whole delegation, that our Government would commit at least $20 billion to help rebuild New York and to take care of the tragedy that befell that magnificent city.
I want to thank the Members who are here who have worked closely with my administration to achieve the common objective of putting $20 billion of Federal money to help the city, surrounding State, the people. And as a matter of fact, as of right now, there's an over $20 billion commitment.
Now, this is the right thing to do. It's the absolute right position for our Government to take. It is essential that New York City come back and come back strong, for the good of the entire Nation.
I will tell you that I am so proud of the citizens of the city in that part of our country. They have shown the world how strong America is in the face of tragedy. They've shown a character that runs deep in the American psyche, that we will not be intimidated, that we won't fail. And it's a proud moment for me to thank the delegation here and to welcome the Governor and the mayor and the Senators and Congresspeople. I look forward to continuing to work with these officials as the mighty city of New York recovers.
And so it's now my honor to bring to the podium the Governor of New York City—the State of New York and then the mayor and then the Senators. First, Governor George Pataki.
