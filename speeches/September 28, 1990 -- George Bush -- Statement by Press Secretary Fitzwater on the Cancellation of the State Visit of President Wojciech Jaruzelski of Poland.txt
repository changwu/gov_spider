    President Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland has written President Bush to decline his invitation to pay a state visit to the United States this fall. President Jaruzelski explained that because of the forthcoming Presidential elections in Poland and his decision to step down before the expiration of his term he did not feel it appropriate to proceed as planned with his visit to the United States.
President Bush accepts President Jaruzelski's decision with full understanding. It is in keeping with President Jaruzelski's contribution to the process of democratic change in Poland since the historic Roundtable Agreement of April 1989. President Jaruzelski deserves great credit for the role he has played, together with the government of Prime Minister Mazowiecki, in working toward Poland's economic recovery and democratic consolidation.
President Bush regrets that President Jaruzelski will not be able to accept this longstanding invitation for a state visit but looks forward to receiving President Jaruzelski at the White House in a private capacity at some time in the future.
