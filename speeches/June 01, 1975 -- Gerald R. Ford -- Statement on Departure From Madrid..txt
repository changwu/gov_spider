    AS WE depart Spain, Mrs. Ford and I wish to express our sincere gratitude to General and Mrs. Franco, to Prince Juan Carlos and Princess Sofia, to President and Mrs. Arias, and to the Spanish Government and to the Spanish people for the wonderful reception accorded to us.
The warmth with which we have been received, the cordial, frank, and productive discussions I have had with your highest officials, the friendship which we have found for the United States, have made our visit to Madrid an unforgettable experience which Mrs. Ford and I will long remember.
Many today question the course of the future, but I have no doubt of the increasingly important role Spain will play in that future, in the world as a whole and, particularly, in the West. Spain is a part, geographically and historically, of Europe. Spain is a part of the transatlantic community. Accordingly, I am sure the future holds for Spain a greater role in European and Atlantic organizations of importance to both of our countries.
You have our sincere thanks and appreciation for the wonderful welcome extended to us at all levels and during every moment of our stay. As a result of my meetings here, I am confident that the United States and Spain, working together, will produce a better life for our peoples and contribute to the prospects of a better life for people everywhere.
