    Alexandria, Va. - January 19, 2016 - Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and GOP presidential candidate, today called on President Obama and the American people to stand in defense of the United States motto, "In God We Trust." A lawsuit recently filed in Akron, Ohio seeks to remove the motto from U.S. currency, claiming it violates the separation of church and state. The plaintiff, Michael Newdow, filed and lost a similar case in 2010, while a 2004 case also sought unsuccessfully to remove "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance. Dr. Carson is appalled by further attempts to undermine America's social and historical values.
"This lawsuit is just the latest in a long string of attempts to strip faith and Judeo-Christian values away from the American people." said Dr. Carson. "Our Founding Fathers understood that our rights were endowed 'by our Creator,' the only power strong enough to provide true liberty. While the freedom to believe in God - or not - is forever enshrined in our Constitution, the First Amendment does not require the abolition of all public religious sentiment, as some seem to want. The President should ardently defend America's motto and oppose these attacks on religion, and I call on 'We the People' to stand up and proclaim 'In God We Trust.'"
