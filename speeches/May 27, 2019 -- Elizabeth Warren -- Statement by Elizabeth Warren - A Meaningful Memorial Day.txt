    By Elizabeth Warren
When I was growing up, Memorial Day was a really big holiday in my family.
All three of my big brothers served in the military. My oldest brother was career military and was deployed to Vietnam over a five year period.
I grew up with my mother always watching for the mail. When a letter came from one of the boys, the day was extra-sunny. She would read it and re-read it, and call my Aunt Max or my grandmother to read it again over the phone.
My brothers all made it home safely, and for that, I'm eternally grateful.
It gave Memorial Day a special meaning: Understanding what others have lost, and honoring even more the sacrifice of those who died in service to our country and those who love them. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.
We're grateful. And here's part of how we show it: Doing everything we can to make sure the decisions made in Washington are in the best interest of our service members, their families, and our national security. Taking care of our veterans when they come home. And fighting to bring these forever wars to a close.
No matter how you honor Memorial Day, I hope you have a meaningful day.
