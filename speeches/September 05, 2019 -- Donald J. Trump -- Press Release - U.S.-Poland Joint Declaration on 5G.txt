    Taking into account that secure fifth generation wireless communications networks (5G) will be vital to both prosperity and national security in the near future, Poland and the United States declare their desire to strengthen our cooperation on 5G. 5G will enable a vast array of new applications, including the provision of critical services to the public, which will benefit our citizens and our economies. Increased amounts of data on 5G networks will further interconnect the economies of all countries, including the United States and Poland and facilitate cross-border services and commerce. Protecting these next generation communications networks from disruption or manipulation and ensuring the privacy and individual liberties of the citizens of the United States, Poland, and other countries is of vital importance.
Therefore, Poland and the United States endorse the Prague Proposals (attached), the Chair's statement from the Prague 5G Security Conference, as an important step toward developing a common approach to 5G network security and ensuring a secure and vibrant 5G ecosystem. The Prague Proposals emphasize the need for 5G networks to be constructed based on free and fair competition, transparency, and the rule of law.
Poland and the United States note that as part of a robust and comprehensive approach to network security, a careful and complete evaluation of 5G component and software providers is essential. We believe that all countries must ensure that only trusted and reliable suppliers participate in our networks to protect them from unauthorized access or interference. A rigorous evaluation of suppliers should include the following elements:
1) Whether the supplier is subject, without independent judicial review, to control by a foreign government;
2) Whether the supplier has a transparent ownership structure; and
3) Whether the supplier has a record of ethical corporate behavior and is subject to a legal regime that enforces transparent corporate practices.
