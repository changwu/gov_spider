    Earlier today, Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Council of Representatives Speaker Salim al-Jabouri to discuss political and security developments in Iraq. The Vice President and Speaker agreed on the importance of rapidly forming a new government that, once in place, can work to address the concerns of all of Iraq's communities. The Vice President commended Speaker Jabouri for his leadership in response to recent attacks against innocent worshipers in Diyala Province and his determination that Iraq's political process must move forward.
