(SAN FRANCISCO, October 2, 2019) — Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer launched "Together," a new ad which highlights the mobilization of eight million Americans who joined the impeachment movement to demand action from their elected officials and hold Donald Trump accountable for the crimes he has committed.
Steyer called for impeachment on June 9, 2017. He is the first 2020 candidate to call for Donald Trump's impeachment. Nearly two years ago he launched Need to Impeach, a grassroots movement with over 8.3 million supporters dedicated to holding Trump accountable for his crimes.
The ad will air on digital platforms starting today and on cable television in the early primary states next week, as Steyer is set to appear on the Ohio debate stage for the first time on October 15.
Steyer is also well on his way to making the debate stage in November, already surpassing the donor threshold requirement and receiving three qualifying polls in the last week.
See below for full script:
Nearly three years of lies and betrayals.
The most corrupt president in history.
And too many politicians stalling, covering up. Too scared — or beholden — to tell the truth.
Two years ago, Tom Steyer started "Need To Impeach."
Millions of voices demanding accountability. Making change happen.
Because when Americans stand together, and put our faith and trust in each other, we can take on any challenge.
I'm Tom Steyer and I approve this message.
Let's make change happen.
