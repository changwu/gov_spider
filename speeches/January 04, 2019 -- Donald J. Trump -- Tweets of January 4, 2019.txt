As I have stated many times if the Democrats take over the House or Senate there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020 too much success!Retweets: 36348Favorites: 168828

The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I'm sure he is a fine man but I don't know Jim and never met him. Patrick Shanahan who is Acting Secretary of Defense is doing a great job!Retweets: 23265Favorites: 105257
