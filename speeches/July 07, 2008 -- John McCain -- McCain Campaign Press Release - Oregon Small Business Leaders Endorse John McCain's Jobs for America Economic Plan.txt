    LAS VEGAS, NV -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its Oregon Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition chairs. On Monday several Portland area small business owners endorsed John McCain's economic plan, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president.
"John McCain's plan to keep taxes low to assist small businesses is very important to me," said Fred Granum, owner of Co Operations of Portland. "Senator Obama's plan to increase payroll taxes and impose expensive mandates will only slow the growth of small businesses that are the economic engine of Oregon and all of America."
Linda Larsen, owner of Bulls Eye Coffee added, "John McCain has proposed to simplify the tax code to help small businesses grow while in comparison, Senator Obama has voted 94 times for higher taxes. Senator Obama's risky economic policies will only hurt small businesses in Oregon."
Today in Denver, Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states. John McCain will continue to discuss his comprehensive blueprint that will create millions of good American jobs, ensure our nation's energy security, get the government's budget and spending practices in order, and bring relief to American consumers.
