    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition and Cooperation in Penal Matters Between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, signed at Washington on April 6, 1973. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the Report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty significantly updates the present extradition relations between the United States and Uruguay and adds to the list of extraditable offenses both narcotic offenses, including those involving psychotropic drugs, and aircraft hijacking. Provision is also made for extradition for conspiracy to commit the listed extraditable offenses.
The Treaty will make a significant contribution to the international effort to control narcotics traffic. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
