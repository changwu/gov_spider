MITT ROMNEY: "The same course we have been on will not lead to a better destination. The same path we are on means $20 trillion in debt at the end of a second term â€” that he won't have. It means crippling unemployment. It means stagnant take-home pay, depressed home values, a devastated military. And by the way, unless we change course, we may be looking at another recession. So the question of this election comes down to this: do you want more of the same or do you want real change? President Obama promised change but he could not deliver change. Now, I promise change and I have a record of achieving real change."
