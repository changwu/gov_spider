    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Florio (D) New Jersey and four others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 153, which would require EPA to distribute 1987 appropriations of $42.5 million for asbestos abatement in schools.
The President's fiscal year 1988 budget proposes a rescission of these funds because:

— previous Federal funding of approximately $90 million provided to 635 needy school districts has already greatly reduced the asbestos pollution problem, and
— the responsibility for asbestos removal rests with the States and local governments. State and local education agencies can best set priorities to conform to local needs. Thirty-two States have already enacted more than 60 asbestos-related laws and nearly half of these States have included financing provisions in their laws.
