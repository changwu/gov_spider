    Today and tomorrow students of Virginia Tech will rise to receive the diplomas they have earned through years of hard work. They can be proud of their academic accomplishments and excited about the opportunities their degrees have opened up for them.
Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month. They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation.
Over the past month, our country has witnessed the compassion and resilient spirit of the community at Virginia Tech. That spirit is on display this weekend in Blacksburg, where thousands of friends and family members have gathered to celebrate commencement and pray for this remarkable school. Our Nation joins them in prayer. And on this special occasion, Laura and I send our love and heartfelt wishes to the entire Hokie family.
