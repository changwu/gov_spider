Some of fashion's biggest names have created a limited-edition collection to help elect the first woman president of the United States (and Democrats from coast to coast). Here's how Hillary Clinton inspired their designs:



  " My support for Hillary is grounded on our long-standing shared belief in equality. I am proud to share this t-shirt as a champion for equal rights, for the progress we have made, and for the hope of continued progress with Hillary as president."Marc Jacobs

A colorful tribute to a seminal moment for women's equality, when Hillary Clinton traveled to Beijing and proudly declared: "Women's rights are human rights."



  " A Hillary Clinton presidency would mark an exciting and bold new chapter in America's story—and in the story for women's equality. Change doesn't happen by keeping things the same. Real change comes from being brave, being different. We have a long way to go but it's not only time for history, but herstory as well."Dao-Yi Chow & Maxwell Osborne
