The White House passes along this background about today's Halloween event.
On Halloween evening, the President and First Lady are hosting local children of firefighters, nurses, police officers, and members of the National Guard at the White House for trick-or-treating. Children will walk through the "President and First Lady's Neighborhood" up to the South Portico of the White House where they will receive treats from the President and First Lady, and other White House "neighbors", including representatives from the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, NASA, United States Secret Service, Peace Corps, White House Fire Brigade, White House staff, and White House Military Office. Disney characters Doc McStuffins and Vampirina, PBS KIDS characters Daniel Tiger, Donkey Hodie, Alma, and Xavier Riddle, and Star Wars characters Darth Vader and stormtroopers, will also stroll through the "President and First Lady's Neighborhood" for the Halloween festivities. The White House is decorated for Halloween with autumnal foliage and fall colors, and a silhouetted neighborhood of homes and community buildings will illuminate the South Portico. Halloween treats are provided by the National Confectioners Association.
