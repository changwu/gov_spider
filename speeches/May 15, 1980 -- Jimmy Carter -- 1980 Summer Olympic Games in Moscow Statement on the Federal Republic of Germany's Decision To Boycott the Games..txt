    We welcome the courageous decision of the West German Olympic Committee to refuse to participate in the Moscow Olympic games. The committee, the West German Government, and the people of West Germany deserve the admiration of all those throughout the world who believe in peace and freedom and who recognize that the achievement of these goals sometimes requires painful sacrifices.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is a serious blow to peace and freedom. We hope that the other Olympic committees of Western Europe will follow the advice of their own governments and join with the West German Olympic Committee in demonstrating their opposition to Soviet aggression.
