    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Canady (R) FL and 116 cosponsors)
H.R. 3660 contains the same serious flaws as H.R. 1833 and H.R. 1122, virtually identical bills that were passed during the 104th and 105th Congresses and vetoed by the President on April 10, 1996, and October 10, 1997, respectively.
The President will veto H.R. 3660 for the reasons he expressed in his veto messages of April 10, 1996, and October 10, 1997, which are attached.
