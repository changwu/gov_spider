    Today, Biden for President launched a new digital ad "Separated" calling out President Trump's extreme anti-immigrant agenda that forcibly separated thousands of children from their parents. The ad announces Joe Biden's day one commitment to create a federal task force focused on reuniting the 545 children who were separated from their parents at the border by the Trump administration, and whose parents have not yet been found.
The ad will run in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.
Script:
Narrator: President Trump issued his immigrant separation issue nearly three years ago.
Jacob Soboroff: "Kids were under mylar blankets on concrete floors after being taken away from the arms of their parents. I will never forget seeing it with my own eyes. Physicians for Human Rights, they call it torture. The American Rights of Pediatrics says it was government-sanctioned child abuse.
Narrator: Nearly three years after Trump's order over 500 children are still not back with their parents
Biden: "What happened? Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated and now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. It's criminal."
Trump: "They're so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean."
Narrator: On his first day as President Joe Biden will issue an executive order creating a federal task force to reunite these children with these parents.
