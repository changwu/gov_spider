    Yesterday, President Biden convened heads of state and leaders from international organizations, the private sector, philanthropies, NGOs, and other partners for virtual summit focused on ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and to build back better global health security so that we can prevent and prepare for future pandemics.
As emerging variants impact global response efforts, President Biden challenged the world to tackle the pandemic with new, focused urgency – and to cooperate on our collective response to this crisis to secure our future.
Leading public health officials, advocacy organizations and state and local leaders applauded the President's leadership and commitment to rallying our global partners in the fight to defeat the virus.
