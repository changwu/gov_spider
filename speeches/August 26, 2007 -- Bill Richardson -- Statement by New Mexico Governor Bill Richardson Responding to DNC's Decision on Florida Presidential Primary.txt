    MANCHESTER, NH- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today responded to the DNC's decision to penalize Florida Democrats, if they move their primary before February 5, 2008. The Governor issued the following statement:
"I understand that yesterday's decision was not an easy one, but it was it done in a democratic, orderly, and fair manner," said Governor Bill Richardson. "I am confident that over the next thirty days a final resolution will be agreed upon that will guarantee that everyone's vote can count. Ultimately, I believe it is important that the Democratic nominating calendar be confirmed sooner rather than later. As Democrats it is important for us to use our voices to discuss the very serious issues facing our country and our differences with the Republicans. Over the next 6 months, I am looking forward to taking my case of experience plus change directly to the voters."
