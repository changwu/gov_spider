Press Secretary Jen Psaki came at the back of the plane for a 25-minute gaggle. No major news, highlights below. Please check against transcript.
Pfizer facility?"At the Pfizer facility, president Biden will see where much of the nation's COVID-19 vaccine is being manufactured. He will meet with those on the frontlines producing these vaccines and get an update on how his administration is working with them to increase output".
Iran?The president reiterated "an openness to having a diplomatic conversation"."We don't anticipate taking additional steps.""The Europeans have invited us (...) It is simply an invitation to have a diplomatic conversation. (...) This is the channel that we used in the past, working in partnership with our P5+1 partners.""Part of the mistake of the prior administration's decisions to pull out of the JCPOA was that we no longer had visibility on what was happening on the ground".
Vaccines?"We do feel that by making the global community safer we make the American community safer"."But we are focused now on vaccinating the American people"
Delay in vaccine distribution due to the weather?The goal is "to get the backlog of vaccines out next week. We anticipate we can not only get the backlog out but we can stay on pace with what we are planning to distribute to States next week. So we are expecting we are going to be able to catch up next week."
When will the report on the killing of Jamal Khashoggi be released?"I don't have an update on the timing"
POTUS trip to Texas?"It is a significant footprint for a president travel to a State, especially for a State that is still recovering from a disaster so we are taking all of that into consideration before making specific plans".
POTUS attending the G7 summit in person?"That's in June, I think it's too far away at this point".

After an uneventful flight (no visitors at the back of the plane), Air Force One landed at Joint Base Andrews at 5:24pm.
Adding these quotes from the Pfizer manufacturing facility, thanks to radio pooler Steven Portnoy (Kaitlan Collins questions to Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla)
[13:09] Q: Do y'all plan to discuss the study showing that the one dose of the Pfizer vaccine is effective and therefore there's a consideration about delaying a second dose?
[13:23] BOURLA: No, there is no study that shows that you can delay. We haven't studied, unfortunately, the delay. We only have data up to 21 days when we administer the second. We do not know what will happen if we do not administer the second, how long this duration of immunity will last.
[13:43] Q: But are you looking at that, this idea of only doing one dose and then delaying the second dose so that you can vaccinate more people?
BOURLA: We don't think it will work with one right now.
Q: You don't think it will work.
BOURLA: No. But we are looking at it.

Travel pool supplemental report #1 
Hi all,Here's some extra color and quotes from today's trip to Kalamazoo from your pooler in the WHCA seat that I figured I would pass along:-The freezers at the Pfizer manufacturing site were gray. Each freezer can hold up to 360,000 doses, per the Pfizer spokesperson.-Your supplemental pooler asked Gov. Whitmer about the importance of Biden's visit. She said:
"What's happening here at this facility is kind of the epicenter of hope. To really come in and be able to see - why can't we just double overnight? - to understand what all the different pieces are, how quickly and hard we're working to increase vaccines but also what some of the hurdles are to ramping up and this is incredible. This facility's been built up in a matter of months, they're going to be doubling their output in a matter of months looking forward, and so it's really a story that is powerful and optimistic and I think can give people the confidence that we're gonna get through this"
"I think making sure that people have informed expectations is really important. We've been going through this for a long time and its hard and people want the resolution and we're getting there. But to really be able to communicate with the American public what the progress is and how the progress is gonna continue and what to expect is really - I think that gives people peace. And I think that's important."
