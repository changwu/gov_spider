    Michelle and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn about the act of senseless violence in Binghamton, NY, today. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families, and the people of Binghamton. We don't yet know all the facts, but my administration is actively monitoring the situation, and the Vice President is in touch with Governor Paterson and local officials to track developments.
