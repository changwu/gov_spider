    We condemn the senseless act of violence conducted on the West Bank today. We have previously warned that extremist groups might try to use violence to disrupt the forthcoming Middle East peace conference. They cannot be allowed to succeed in sabotaging the peace process. We call upon all parties to condemn this act and reject violence, especially at this critical time. We offer our sympathies to the victims of this terrorist act. 8
