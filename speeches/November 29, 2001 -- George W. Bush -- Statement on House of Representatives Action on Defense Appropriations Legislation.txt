    The House of Representatives yesterday took a bold step to ensure that we fully fund the war on terrorism. I commend the passage of the Defense Appropriation and the commitment it embodies to ensure that, even in war times, we be careful stewards of the taxpayers' money. We will fully support our troops in the field, provide the funds necessary to recover from the September 11th attacks, and spend whatever is necessary to defend our homeland. The agreement I reached with Congress in October provides sufficient funds to accomplish these goals at this time. I, therefore, urge the Senate to pass the Defense Appropriation without adding unwise spending that is not currently necessary.
