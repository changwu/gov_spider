    I am pleased to accept the invitation to serve as honorary chairman of the Presidents Cup, one of the premier international events in golf. I thank Commissioner Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour as well as the participating international golf tours for this invitation. It is an honor to succeed Presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford, as well as Australian Prime Minister John Howard, as honorary chairman of this event.
I know that, more and more, people around the world share America's enthusiasm for golf. The Presidents Cup helps bring our countries together in spirited and good-natured competition. In 1996 I was glad to attend the Presidents Cup at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, and I am looking forward to another display of skill and sportsmanship by the United States and international teams in October 2000.
