    I send my congratulations to Kishida Fumio on his election by the Diet to be Prime Minister of Japan. The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and the world, and I look forward to working closely with Prime Minister Kishida to strengthen our cooperation in the months and years ahead. The historic partnership between our two democracies and our two peoples will continue to be a critical asset as we work together to take on the challenges of our time. I also want to commend former Prime Minister Suga for a successful tenure and thank him for his partnership to advance the U.S.-Japan alliance.
