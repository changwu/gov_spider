    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Arizona State Treasurer Doug Ducey.
"Treasurer Ducey's endorsement is further proof that my pro-growth, low-spending message is resonating with Arizona voters," said Mitt Romney. "I look forward to working with Treasurer Ducey and the rest of my Arizona team to ensure that President Obama is a one-term President."
"After spending more than 20 years in the private sector as a businessman and entrepreneur, I know that government is not always focused on job creation," said State Treasurer Ducey. "Job creators and entrepreneurs support Mitt Romney because he is the only candidate who has the real-world economic experience that is needed to get people back to work. Four years ago, President Obama promised to fix our country's problems but has clearly failed. Arizona and the rest of the country deserve a leader like Mitt Romney."
