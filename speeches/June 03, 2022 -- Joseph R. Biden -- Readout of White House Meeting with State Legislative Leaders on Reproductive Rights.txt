    Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, hosted a meeting with state legislative leaders in Kansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina on efforts to defend reproductive health and rights.
Legislative leaders discussed the status of ongoing attacks in these states on reproductive rights, as well as their efforts to protect access to critical reproductive health care. On August 2, 2022, Kansans will vote on a ballot measure that would strip the right to abortion from the state constitution. The Kansas Supreme Court has twice ruled that the Kansas state constitution guarantees the fundamental right to abortion. Louisiana's legislature will adjourn in a matter of days, and multiple bills are currently circulating that would undercut women's rights. In North Carolina, ongoing work is required to protect access to care. White House Senior Officials thanked participants for their leadership and efforts to defend reproductive freedom.
Today's engagement follows a meeting senior White House officials held last week with legislators who are advancing legislation to protect reproductive rights.
State legislative leaders from today's meeting included:

North Carolina House Democratic Leader Robert Reives
North Carolina Representative Julie Von Haefen
Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes
Kansas House Minority Whip Stephanie Clayton
Kansas Senate Minority Whip Pat Pettey
Kansas House Minority Caucus Chair Barbara Ballard
