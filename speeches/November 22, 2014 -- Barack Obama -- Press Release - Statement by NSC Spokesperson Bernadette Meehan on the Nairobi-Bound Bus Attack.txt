    The United States condemns in the strongest terms today's horrific attack in Kenya by the terrorist group al-Shabaab against innocent civilians traveling aboard a Nairobi-bound bus. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the 28 individuals killed. The United States stands with our Kenyan partners in the effort to counter the threat of terrorism and affirms our ongoing commitment to working with all Kenyans to combat these atrocities.
