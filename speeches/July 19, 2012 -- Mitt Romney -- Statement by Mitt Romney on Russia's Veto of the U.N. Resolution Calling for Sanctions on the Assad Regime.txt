    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on Russia's veto of the U.N. resolution calling for sanctions on the Assad regime:
"Russia's veto again shows the hollowness of President Obama's failed 'reset' policy with Russia and his lack of leadership on Syria. President Obama has given away generous concessions on missile defense and nuclear arms to Russia, but has received little in return except obstruction and belligerence. Â While Russia and Iran have rushed to support Bashar al-Assad and thousands have been slaughtered, President Obama has abdicated leadership and subcontracted U.S. policy to Kofi Annan and the United Nations. Under this President, American influence and respect for our position around the world is at a low ebb."
