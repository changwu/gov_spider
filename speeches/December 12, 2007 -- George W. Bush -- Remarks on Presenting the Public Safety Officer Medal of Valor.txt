    You know, one of the wonderful experiences of being a President is to welcome citizens who have served their communities with valor and compassion. And Iâ€”General and I are surrounded by four such gentlemen who have been heroic in their duties. They will tell you they were just doing their job; I'm telling you they did their job with extraordinary courage. And so it's been an honor to award them this precious medal. And I want to thank you all very much for joining us. Proud to call you fellow citizens.
