    Senator Kit Bond has been a wonderful public servant and statesman for the people of Missouri. During more than three decades of service as Governor and United States Senator, Kit has been a tireless advocate for our children, our military, and our Nation's intelligence community. He played a vital role in the effort to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Because of his leadership, we are protecting the liberties of our citizens while gathering vital information we need to prevent attacks on our soil.
I have been honored to work with Senator Bond during my time as President, and Laura and I wish Kit, Linda, and their son Samuel all the best in the future.
