    I am having a little party at the Lodge on the afternoon of the 4th of July, partly so far as I am concerned in the celebration of that national birthday and personally in celebration of my own birthday. I should like to have the newspapermen and the photographers come out. The band from Terry, Montana, is going to visit me on that afternoon, and also the mounted Boy Scouts of Custer. I think that is the only troop of Boy Scouts that are mounted anywhere in the United States. I expect now that it will begin about 1:30 in the afternoon. I think that hereafter if it is agreeable to the press we will call this con-ference at 11:30 instead of quarter to twelve, and that will give me a little more opportunity to get home for lunch.
