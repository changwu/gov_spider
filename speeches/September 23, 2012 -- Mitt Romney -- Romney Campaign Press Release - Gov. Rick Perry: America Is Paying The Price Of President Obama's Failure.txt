    Texas Governor Rick Perry today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about not being able to change Washington:  
"On Thursday, President Obama told Americans that one of the things he's learned from his time in the White House is that 'you can't change Washington from the inside.' So much for that hope and change he campaigned on in 2008. Instead of making the tough decisions necessary to get a grip on spending and get our economy moving again, his administration's economic plan is to raise taxes, add to the debt and instigate a massive money-printing scheme. The twenty-three million Americans struggling for work are paying the price of his failure. The American people deserve a leader with a proven record of getting things done. President Obama is right: he can't change Washington. But Mitt Romney can, and he will."
