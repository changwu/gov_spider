    THE ENERGY CRISIS is now touching the lives of millions of Americans. And just as the people of this country are doing their part to meet this crisis, now it is time for the Federal Government, your Government, to do its part by enacting legislation that will accomplish these goals.
In a meeting with the legislative leaders this morning, I set forth these primary objectives that I consider to be of the highest priority for the Congress as it begins its new session:
--First, we must protect the jobs of American workers.
--Second, we must prevent price gouging when you buy gas for your car and heating oil for your homes.
--Third, we will compel the oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with complete information on their supplies. And we will prevent them from making windfall profits as a result of the sacrifices that you are making.
Today, I asked the Congress to enact over 15 different legislative measures which will accomplish these goals. In the next few weeks, I will be sending up additional proposals to get this job done. This legislation is urgently needed to meet the current crisis and to assure that we, the United States, can become self-sufficient in energy by 1980 and not be dependent upon any other country for our energy needs.
For several weeks now, millions of Americans have voluntarily accepted sacrifices in their comfort and convenience so that no American would suffer hardship because of the energy crisis.
It is that sacrifice that has helped us to get through this emergency so far. If that kind of cooperation by millions of Americans continues, it means that we can help to avoid gas rationing this spring.
