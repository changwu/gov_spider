    Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President Campaign Manager Beth Myers issued the following statement regarding the McCain campaign and push polling allegations:
"The Romney campaign had nothing to do with these alleged push polling calls. It is reckless, irresponsible and egregious for the McCain campaign to even mention the Romney campaign in relation to these calls. If they have any proof, let's see it. If not, Senator McCain should immediately apologize for the actions of his own campaign."
