    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I transmit herewith the 12th Annual Report of the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers fiscal year 1995.
As the report demonstrates, the National Endowment for Democracy remains at the forefront of our efforts to expand and consolidate democratic gains around the globe. The strong bipartisan support the Endowment continues to receive reflects our Nation's steadfast commitment to the promotion of democracy.
