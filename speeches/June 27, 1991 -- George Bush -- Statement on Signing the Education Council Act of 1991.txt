    Today I have signed S. 64, the "Education Council Act of 1991." This legislation is the first legislative success for our AMERICA 2000 strategy and is an example of the constructive, bipartisan effort needed to transform our educational system.
This legislation establishes a National Commission on Time and Learning and a National Council on Education Standards and Testing. Their establishment will help us to focus on issues critical to schools and students in this Nation and to rethink how we can best achieve educational excellence in America.
The National Commission on Time and Learning, which is similar to the Commission proposed in our AMERICA 2000 plan, will examine the quality and adequacy of the study and learning time of the Nation's elementary and secondary students. It will consider issues regarding the length of the school day and year, the role of homework, the use of time spent for academic subjects, year-round professional opportunities for teachers, and the use of schools for extended learning programs.
The National Council on Education Standards and Testing will report, by December 31, 1991, to the Congress, the Secretary of Education, and the National Education Goals Panel on the establishment of national education standards and an appropriate system of voluntary national testing, activities proposed in AMERICA 2000. It explicitly recognizes the importance of the National Education Goals Panel and its role.
I urge the Congress to pass quickly the remaining legislative components of AMERICA 2000, including proposals that would create a New Generation of American Schools, promote parental choice, and establish Governors' Academies for Teachers and School Leaders. AMERICA 2000 is a vital part of our decade-long crusade to help America reach the National Education Goals. Passage of the "AMERICA 2000 Excellence in Education Act" will hasten our advance toward achieving those goals.
