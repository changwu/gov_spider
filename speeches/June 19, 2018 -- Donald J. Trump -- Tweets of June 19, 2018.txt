Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. Others countries are even worse. Be smart America!Retweets: 19736Favorites: 80573

Democrats are the problem. They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our Country like MS-13. They can't win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters!Retweets: 28272Favorites: 109384

We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally. Of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions.Retweets: 32768Favorites: 122189

#CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security.Retweets: 20015Favorites: 80534
