    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As I have said on a number of occasions in the past, I see Federal employees as the unsung heroes of America. One of the ways they have shown their heroism over the years is in their generosity to others by their participation in the Combined Federal Campaign. This generosity is exemplified not only by the many thousands of employees who contribute to the campaign but especially by those who show their support by taking leadership roles in the conduct of the campaign each year. That is what I am asking of you, to become part of the tradition of voluntary giving by Federal employees through your leadership of the Combined Federal Campaign.
Secretary of Veterans Affairs Edward J. Derwinski has agreed to serve as Chairman of the 1989 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I am asking that you support Secretary Derwinski by personally serving as Chairman of the Campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your Vice Chairman. Please confirm with Secretary Derwinski your willingness to serve and provide him with the name of your designated Vice Chairman.
As you know, your leadership is key to the Combined Federal Campaign, and your personal interest, visible support, and participation are essential to a successful 1989 Campaign. I know that you will make a special effort to encourage all of your employees, both in the Washington, D.C. area and in all of the Combined Federal Campaigns worldwide, to support the campaign.
George Bush
