    My dear Senator:
Although considerable progress has been made as a result of efforts to reorganize the work of the Federal Communications Commission under existing law, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the present legal framework and administrative machinery of the Commission. I have come to the definite conclusion that new legislation is necessary to effectuate a satisfactory reorganization of the Commission.
New legislation is also needed to lay down clear Congressional policies on the substantive sideâ€”so clear that the new administrative body will have no difficulty in interpreting or administering them.
I very much hope that your Committee will consider the advisability of such new legislation.
I have sent a duplicate of this letter to Chairman Lea of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and I have asked Chairman McNinch of the Commission to discuss this problem with you and give you his recommendations.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Burton K. Wheeler,
United States Senate,
Washington, D. C.
