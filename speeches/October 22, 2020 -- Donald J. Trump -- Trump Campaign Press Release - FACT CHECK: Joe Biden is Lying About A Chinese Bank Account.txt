Joe Biden making a pathetic attempt to distract from his own foreign corruption by inventing a fake issue for President Trump. In reality, Biden's accusation is absolutely baseless. Here are the facts:


President Trump does not have a personal Chinese bank account.


Long before Donald Trump ran for president, Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C. opened an account with a Chinese bank that has offices in the United States in order to pay local taxes in China and to explore potential hotel deals in Asia.


No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized, and since 2015, the business office has remained inactive.




The Trump Organization maintains bank accounts in other countries where it does business, as international businesses typically do.


The Trump Organization's account proves one thing: an international hotel business was an international hotel business. Meanwhile, Joe Biden still owes the American people answers about his foreign corruption and dangerous ties to China.
