    By Mike Huckabee
Welcome to our campaign website.
Ultimately, running for President is about people: connecting with them, understanding them and offering up solutions and ideas that will make their lives better.
Our country is full of friendly, hopeful people who want something better for themselves and their family.
They work hard, they play by the rules and they are hopeful that tomorrow will be better.
If we squander their trust, if we fail to give them hope and only focus on the failures we see around us, we are not making America better we are only tearing her apart.
Let's take America from hope to higher ground.
God bless,
Mike Huckabee
