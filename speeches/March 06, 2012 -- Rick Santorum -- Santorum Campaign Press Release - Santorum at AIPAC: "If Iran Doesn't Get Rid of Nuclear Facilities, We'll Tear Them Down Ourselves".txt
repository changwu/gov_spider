    Washington, DC - On this all-important Super Tuesday, Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum stepped away from the campaign trail to personally address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Washington, DC regarding the vital national security threat facing both the United States and Israel.
In his speech, Santorum said:
"This is a somewhat important day in my life today, but I wanted to come off the campaign trail to come here, because one of the reasons that I decided to run for president is because of the grave concern I have about the security of our country."
"A nuclear Iran with a nuclear shield to project terror around the world is a nightmare for all freedom-loving people in the world.
"If Iran doesn't get rid of nuclear facilities, we will tear down them ourselves."
"This is not bellicosity and warmongering, this is preventing the most radical regime in the world from having a weapon that could fundamentally change the security posture" of "all freedom-loving people in the world."
"Under a Santorum Administration, we would find no gap between Israel and the United States because our interests are united."
"I've seen a president who has been reticent, he says he has Israel's back. From everything I've seen from the conduct of this administration, he has turned his back on the people of Israel."
