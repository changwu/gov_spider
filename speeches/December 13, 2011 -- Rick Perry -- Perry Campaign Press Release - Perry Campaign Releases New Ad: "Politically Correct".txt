    AUSTIN — The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "Politically Correct," which will air on national cable and Iowa broadcast and cable.


"As the only non-Washington, non-establishment candidate left in the race for the Republican nomination, Gov. Perry is committed to seriously overhauling Washington and telling the American people the truth," said Perry campaign communications director Ray Sullivan. "As president, he will work to break the direct links between Washington, D.C., and Wall Street, start foreign aid decisions for every country at zero, and fix social security."
