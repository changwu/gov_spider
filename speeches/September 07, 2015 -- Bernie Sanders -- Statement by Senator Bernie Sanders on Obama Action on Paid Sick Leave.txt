    AMHERST, N.H. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday issued the following statement applauding President Barack Obama for issuing an executive order requiring paid sick leave for employees of federal contractors:
"The president's executive order on paid sick leave is exactly the right thing to do. Now that paid sick leave has been extended to hundreds of thousands of Americans who work for federal contractors, Congress has got to extend these rights to all workers.
"We have got to end the international embarrassment of the U.S. being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee paid leave to workers. Not only do workers need paid sick leave, they also need at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and at least two weeks of paid vacation. In the richest country on earth, no one should force mothers to go back to work days or weeks after giving birth."
