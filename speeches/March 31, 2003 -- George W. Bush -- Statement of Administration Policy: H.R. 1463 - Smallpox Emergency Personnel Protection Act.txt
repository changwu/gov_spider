    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Burr (R) NC and six cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1463, which would establish a new Federal program to compensate eligible health care workers, public safety personnel, and other "first responders" who suffer serious reactions or die as a result of receiving the smallpox vaccine. This new program is modeled on the same program now available to America's public safety officers who die or are disabled while serving our nation.
Smallpox is a disease that is very contagious and can spread rapidly, so the President has asked medical response teams to be prepared to respond and protect the American people should an outbreak occur. By vaccinating our health care workers and first responders against smallpox and giving them assistance through this compensation program, we will be better able to protect the American people.
The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate to ensure that these important benefits are available to those who follow the President's call to volunteer to help protect the Nation against this bioterror threat.
