    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis brought in $8.2 million in the first 24 hours following his campaign launch, shattering the record previously held by Joe Biden in 2019 ($6.3 million). The $8.2 million figure is a hard-dollar, direct-to-campaign figure.
"This historic fundraising haul shows that grassroots Republicans across the country are uniting behind Governor DeSantis' vision for our Great American Comeback," campaign manager Generra Peck said. "Governor DeSantis has built the strongest, most sophisticated organization in the history of American politics, and the tremendous support we've experienced in the last 24 hours will be critical as we hit the ground running in the early nominating states to share Governor DeSantis' plan to revitalize the American Spirit."
This record hard-dollar haul will be critical in supporting Governor DeSantis' nationwide movement to lead the Republican Party into the future. The governor's historic fundraising success comes on the heels of a flurry of support for his candidacy and the announcement of "Our Great American Comeback Tour" in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina next week.
