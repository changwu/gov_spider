    Mitt Romney will meet with America's families and business owners in small towns in six states as part of his "Every Town Counts" five-day bus tour. The "Every Town Counts" bus tour will begin in New Hampshire on June 15 and will continue on to small towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan.
"For three and a half years, President Obama has paid little attention to the everyday concerns of the American people," Mitt Romney said. "President Obama has offered no hope for the future, and he has left American families to bear the burden of his failed policies. Too many American families have experienced a lost job, faced foreclosure, or been forced to spend their kids' college savings just to make ends meet. These are not statistics – these are our fellow Americans. In America's small towns, you don't find despair -- you find boundless optimism. We know we can make America better, and that is why I am running for president."
