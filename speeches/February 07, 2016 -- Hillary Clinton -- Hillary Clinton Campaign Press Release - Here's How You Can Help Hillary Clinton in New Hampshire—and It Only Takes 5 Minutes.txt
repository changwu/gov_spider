    
It's go time.
With only two days left until the first-in-the-nation primary, we've got our work cut out for us.
And as we learned from our close victory in Iowa, every conversation you can have with a voter really does matter.
So here's your mission for today: Call three Hillary supporters in New Hampshire and remind them to vote on Tuesday.
You don't even need a phone! Just click here to download instructions, and you'll be all set.
It's easy! We'll give you everything you need to do an awesome job: a script, FAQs, and even live online trainings at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m. ET.
You don't need to know all the facts and figures about the campaignâ€”you just need to be excited to remind Hillary supporters to head to the polls on Tuesday!
If you're with Hillary, now's the time to help her out.
