    Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's decision by the Supreme Court has guaranteed higher costs, fewer choices, and less control over our healthcare by ruling to uphold President Obama's healthcare law. As we all know, this law brings government bureaucracy into our personal, healthcare decisions. It must be replaced immediately with a solution that allows patients and doctors to determine the best course of medical treatments, not the government. This decision highlights just what is at stake in the election in November. By choosing Mitt Romney as our country's next President, we will elect a leader who understands that it is the American people, not government, who know how to fulfill their individual needs."
