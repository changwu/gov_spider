    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the obligations of the United States of America as a member of the International Labor Organization I transmit herewith authentic texts of a Recommendation (No. 91 ) concerning collective agreements and a Recommendation (No. 92 ) concerning voluntary conciliation and arbitration, both of which were adopted on June 29, 1951 by the International Labor Conference at its thirty-fourth session, held at Geneva from June 6 to June 29, 1951.
I transmit also the report of the Acting Secretary of State with regard to the two Recommendations, together with a copy of a letter from the Secretary of Labor to the Secretary of State setting forth the coordinated view of the interested departments and agencies of the executive branch of the Government with respect to the Recommendations. I particularly invite the attention of the Congress to the recommendation of those departments and agencies that no legislative action be taken, for the reasons set forth in the above-mentioned letter of the Secretary of Labor.
For action and advice with respect to American Samoa and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (excluding the Northern Mariana Islands with the exception of Rota), and for transmission to the Governments of Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands in order that those Governments may give consideration to the enactment of legislation or other action, I am sending texts of the Recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior. Also, I am transmitting the texts of the Recommendations to the Secretary of the Navy for such action and advice as may be suitable with respect to that portion of the Trust Territory which includes the Northern Mariana Islands except Rota.
