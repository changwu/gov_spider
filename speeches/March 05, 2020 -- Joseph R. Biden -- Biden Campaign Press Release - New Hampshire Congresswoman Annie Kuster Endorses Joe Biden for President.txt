    Today, New Hampshire Congresswoman Annie Kuster released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Joe Biden is the uniter who can bring our country together and put an end to the divisiveness and hate being spread by President Trump and his Administration. Joe has a proven track record of delivering for hardworking American families. He authored the Violence Against Women Act, has worked tirelessly to protect our climate, and commands respect on the international stage -- but most importantly, I know that Joe will bring dignity, honor, courage, and respect back to the White House. He will restore the values our nation needs at the very top. I'm proud to support Joe."
Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 60 U.S. Representatives and seven U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
