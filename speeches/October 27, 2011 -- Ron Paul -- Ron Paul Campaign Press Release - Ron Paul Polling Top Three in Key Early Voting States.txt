    Solid double-digit support in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” A CNN/Time poll released yesterday shows Congressman Paul polling third in the key early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
Dr. Paul, whose loyal base of support is unlikely to transfer to any of his GOP competitors, polled at a strong 12 percent in all three states.
"The steady, growing support Ron Paul earns in the key early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina is a direct result of his winning message of Constitutionally-limited government, sound money, and a strong national defense," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
