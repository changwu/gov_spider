    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on the passing of Tony Snow:
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Tony Snow. He was a loving father, husband, friend and truly one of America's most gifted commentators. Whether he sat behind a radio mic or stood behind a White House podium, Tony Snow always sought to give the American people new insights into our government, political process and leaders. He asked the tough questions and took them as well. Even when diagnosed with cancer, his fight served as an inspiration to all Americans. In the coming days, we will celebrate the life of a truly great and generous man."
