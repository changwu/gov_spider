    The Romney Vision For A Conservative Court

Mitt Romney, "Governor Mitt Romney On The Beginning Of The U.S. Supreme Court Term," Press Release, 10/01/07)

Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) Said She Will Appoint Supreme Court Judges To "Lead Us On A Different Course." SEN. CLINTON: "I recognized the danger posed to Roe v. Wade by the nominations of Samuel Alito and John Roberts to the Supreme Court. I spoke out about this threat to the right to choose and opposed both of them.
