    Earlier today, President Obama called Phil Jackson, head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, to congratulate him and his team on winning the NBA Finals for the second year in a row and on Jackson’s 11th championship as a head coach. The President said that it was a great series, worthy of the rivalry and noted that in last night’s game, Derek Fisher had yet another huge postseason shot. The President said he looked forward to congratulating the team in person at the White House.
