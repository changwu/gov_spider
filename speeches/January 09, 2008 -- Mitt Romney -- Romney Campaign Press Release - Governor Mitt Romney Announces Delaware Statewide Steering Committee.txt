Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the ten members of the Delaware Romney for President Statewide Steering Committee. These Republican leaders will lead Governor Romney's efforts in the state and communicate his vision for bringing real conservative change to Washington.
Upon the announcement, Governor Romney said, "This group of leaders represent the qualities that make this a great state, and I appreciate their support as we look toward the Delaware Republican Convention in early May, and the Presidential election in November."
"Governor Romney's vision, values and experience make him the best choice for Delaware voters," said Delaware Romney for President Statewide Steering Committee Chairman Tom Wagner. "As the people of Delaware learn more about his achievements, about his history of turning around businesses, government, and the 2002 Winter Olympics, I am convinced that they will agree. He is the right candidate to bring real conservative change to Washington."
