    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an agreement effected by exchange of notes of June 29 and July 24, 1987, extending for the period of one year from December 31, 1987, until December 31, 1988, the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signed at Washington on November 26, 1976. The exchange of notes, together with the present Agreement, constitutes a Governing International Fishery Agreement within the requirements of Section 201(c) of the Act.
This Agreement is one of a series negotiated in accordance with the Act and has been extended for periods of between one year and 18 months since July 1982. The extension of the Agreement would ensure the continuation of mutually beneficial joint ventures between the U.S. and Soviet fishing industries in the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Unless the Agreement is extended, these operations will cease, causing significant financial hardship to U.S. fishermen.
I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this extension at an early date.
