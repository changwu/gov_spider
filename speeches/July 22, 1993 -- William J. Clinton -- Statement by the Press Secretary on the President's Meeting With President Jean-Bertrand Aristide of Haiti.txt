    President Clinton held a cordial and constructive meeting this morning with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes. This was their first meeting since the signing of the so-called Governors Island agreement on July 3, although they spoke by telephone on July 4.
The President commended President Aristide on his signing of the agreement, which establishes a sound timetable for the restoration of democracy and for Aristide's return to Haiti on October 30, just 100 days from now. The President described the agreement as an historic step forward for democracy, economic prosperity, and freedom for Haiti. He reaffirmed that the United States will continue to play a leadership role with the international community in helping foster a better life for the Haitian people.
The President and President Aristide discussed the steps that need to be taken to fulfill the terms of the agreement, including the naming of a new Prime Minister by President Aristide in consultation with members of the Haitian Parliament.
