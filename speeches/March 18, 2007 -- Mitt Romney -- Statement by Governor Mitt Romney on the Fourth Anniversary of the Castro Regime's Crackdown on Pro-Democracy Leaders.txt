Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today on the fourth anniversary of the Castro regime's crackdown on pro-democratic leaders in Cuba:
"Fidel Castro has littered Cuba's history with his hostility towards freedom and refusal to recognize the dignity of the Cuban people. Today marks another unfortunate anniversary in the Castro regime's infamous narrative.
"On this day in 2003, 75 pro-democracy leaders, journalists and human-rights activists were arrested, summarily tried and imprisoned for sentences of up to 28 years for such ludicrous 'crimes' as organizing activities in support of a democratic Cuba and disseminating information for this purpose.
"Today, as our nation confronts a new generation of challenges, we cannot forget those who remain imprisoned in Cuba's decrepit, inhumane prisons. There should be no end to the international community's condemnation of the Castro regime's human rights abuses and its insistence that all political prisoners be unconditionally released."
