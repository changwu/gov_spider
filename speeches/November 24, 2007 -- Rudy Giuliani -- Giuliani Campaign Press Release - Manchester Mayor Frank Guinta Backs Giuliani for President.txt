    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Manchester Mayor Frank Guinta is supporting Mayor Giuliani for President. Mayor Guinta will serve as Rudy's New Hampshire State Co-Chairman. Guinta, who recently was re-elected to a second term as Mayor of the state's largest city, is one of the Granite State's most prominent Republicans.
"Rudy Giuliani has been tested on the issues New Hampshire Republicans care about most. As Mayor of America's largest city, he cut taxes, eliminated wasteful spending and dramatically reduced crime," said Mayor Guinta. "Mayor Giuliani is the type of strong, visionary leader we need as President. I look forward to campaigning alongside the Mayor and helping him win the New Hampshire primary."
"It is an honor to have the support of Mayor Guinta. He understands how important it is for government to live within its means and to protect citizens by fighting crime," said Mayor Giuliani. "Mayor Guinta's advice and counsel will prove invaluable in my effort to win the New Hampshire Primary."
Guinta joins several top New Hampshire Republicans who are backing Mayor Giuliani, including former Congressman Bill Zeliff, Ambassador Joseph Petrone and his wife Augusta, Councilor Ray Wieczorek, former House Speakers Doug Scamman and Stewart Lamprey, House GOP Whip Stephen Stepanek, and former state GOP chairs Rhona Charbonneau and Wayne Semprini.
