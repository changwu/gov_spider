The New Hampshire primary is tomorrow, and it's going to be a close one. Every single person we can get to the polls could make the difference.
I'm going to let you in on a little campaign secret: There's one nearly surefire way to get someone to vote.
Ask them.
In all likelihood, you don't live in New Hampshire. Guess what? Neither do I—but I have a few friends who live in the Granite State, and I bet you do too.
Please believe that the most important thing you can do right now to help Hillary on Tuesday is send a Facebook message to your friends in New Hampshire.?
Step one: Find them on Facebook.?Click this link and they'll pop up.
Step two: Send a message to each of your New Hampshire friends. If you really don't know anyone who lives there, post something anyway—you never know who you'll inspire.
So for example, I might say something like:
Hey, New Hampshire friend/long-lost cousin/college roommate I haven't spoken to in forever—
I know you're planning to vote tomorrow, right?!
And if you're still making up your mind about who to vote for, I hope you'll check out Hillary Clinton's positions and see where she stands. I know you've always been concerned about college affordability—did you know Hillary has a smart, detailed plan for that? It's one of the reasons I'm working so hard to elect her. You can check it out at hillaryclinton.com.
No matter who you vote for, make sure you vote! You can find your polling place here: hrc.io/1Px4R2N.
Take care,

Folks, I'll be honest with you: We've got our work cut out for us. As we saw in Iowa, every voter contact we make can have an outsized impact. So let's leave it all on the field and go win this thing.
What are you waiting for?
