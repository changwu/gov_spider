Given [Kasich's] political profile, he's someone who, as the GOP nominee, would have a reasonable shot at winning the presidency.

As a well-liked and respected purple-state governor, Kasich is a better party-unifying prospect than the abrasive hard-right Texan.
And in contrast with Cruz's phony filibusters and pointless budgetary brinksmanship, Kasich actually has a record of conservative accomplishment.

He's also been a successful governor of Ohio, a state without which no Republican has ever won the White House.

Kasich also runs strongest against Clinton in the key swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. And in small but possibly critical New Hampshire.
So the logic is clearly there. That said, it's also true that logic and the long view haven't exactly been holding the reins this primary season.
But despite the unpredictable twists and turns, the case for Kasich has steadily improved, moving from complicated to conceivable to credible.
Expect it to become more persuasive post-Rubio, as Republicans wake up to the fact that the Ohio governor is the only one of the remaining hopefuls who doesn't have "November Disaster" emblazoned on his forehead.
