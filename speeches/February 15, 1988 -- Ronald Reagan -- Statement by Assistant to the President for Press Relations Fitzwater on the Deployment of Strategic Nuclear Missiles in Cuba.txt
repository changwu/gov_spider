    The SS-4 and SS-5 missile sites established in Cuba between late August and mid-October 1962 were confirmed as having been destroyed in that year. We also are confident that the missiles were removed from Cuba at that time. We have had extensive intelligence collection directed at Cuba since 1962 and have no evidence that SS-4, SS-5, or other strategic missiles have been deployed there.
