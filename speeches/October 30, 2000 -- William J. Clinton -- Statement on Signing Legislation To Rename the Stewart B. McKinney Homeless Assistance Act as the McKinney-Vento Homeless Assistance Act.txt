    Today, I am very pleased to sign into law H.R. 5417, which would rename the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the "McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act."
I am deeply saddened by Representative Vento's recent passing. Representative Vento was a great friend of the poor and the homeless. His leadership on the issue of homelessness will be greatly missed in Minnesota and across the Nation.
Representative Vento was a key leader in the effort to secure the original passage in 1987 of the McKinney Act, the first and still the most significant Federal program to assist homeless persons. His commitment to those left behind did not end with the passage of the homeless assistance bill. For over a decade he remained a leading voice for social justice on Capitol Hill, introducing legislation to expand and improve services to homeless people, and continually reminding his colleagues and the American people of our responsibility to our most vulnerable neighbors. Representative Vento was also a passionate advocate for affordable housing and protecting our Nation's natural resources.
Bruce Vento's passing represents a significant loss for Americans who care about ending homelessness, ensuring housing opportunity, and protecting the environment. Renaming the McKinney Act the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act will serve to regularly remind our Nation of Bruce Vento's passion for justice and the responsibility we each have for our homeless neighbors.
