    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today with State Councilor Yang Jiechi of China at the White House. Ambassador Rice and State Councilor Yang reviewed plans for President Xi's visit in September and discussed outcomes that both sides commit to work toward for the visit. In reviewing the bilateral relationship, Ambassador Rice and State Councilor Yang agreed to support the further development of military-military relations, law enforcement cooperation, and people-to-people ties. They discussed a range of regional and global challenges and expressed support for strengthening coordination on global health security, development, climate and clean energy cooperation, nonproliferation, and environmental conservation. They reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They also urged continued progress by the P5+1, in coordination with the EU, as they seek to achieve a long-term comprehensive solution that verifiably ensures Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. Ambassador Rice and State Councilor Yang discussed candidly maritime and cyber issues, and Ambassador Rice urged China to take concrete steps to address these concerns.
