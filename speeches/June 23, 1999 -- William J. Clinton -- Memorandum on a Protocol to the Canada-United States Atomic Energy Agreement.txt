Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy
Subject: Presidential Determination on the Proposed Protocol Amending the Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada
I have considered the proposed Protocol Amending the Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada signed at Washington on June 15, 1955, as amended, along with the views, recommendations, and statements of the interested agencies.
