    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Daschle (D) South Dakota and 11 others)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 1408. This bill would extend the application and training deadlines under the Emergency Veterans Job Training Act of 1983, P.L. 98-77, and authorize $75 million for the program for fiscal year 1986. The extension of this emergency program is not consistent with the significant improvement in the economy since 1983 and the sharp drop in the unemployment level for the veterans covered under the program.
The Administration also opposes increasing the maximum grade level for appointment under the Veterans Readjustment Appointment (VRA) program from GS-9 to GS-11. The level was raised to GS-9 from GS-7 in October 1984, as recommended by the Administration; the GS-11 journeyman level is inappropriate for use in the VRA program.
