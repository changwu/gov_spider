    Atlanta, GA—Students with Newt, the official student coalition of Newt 2012, has released a new video.
 
In the video, a series of students from across the country argue that Newt is the clear conservative candidate to lead the young conservative generation, calling on Newt's past accomplishments as a conservative leader.
 
"I think that he has proven his leadership abilities, and that's something we need in Washington right now," senior Angela Morabito explains.
 
Students with Newt has gained national momentum, setting up chapters on over 230 college and university campuses.
 
Matt Resavy, a national co-chair for Students with Newt, attributed the momentum to Gingrich's conservative credentials.
 
"Speaker Gingrich is a true cross generational leader," said Resavy. "He's led the young conservative generation before, and we're here to say: we want him to lead us again."
 
In Florida, over 45 college chapters are volunteering for the several campaign offices across the state.
 
In a statement, Florida Students with Newt Chairman Scott Hagan explained that students areuniting behind Newt as the conservative with a record who will improve the country.
 
"Florida college students understand the problems that face us in the future and they know our current situation is dire" said Hagan.
 
"We know there is one man, a man with the wisdom, the abilities, and the record of conservatism that has driven his life and policies. We believe in this man, and believe our future and our country will be better off with him as president."
