    On Monday, August 4, 2014, the President signed into law H.J. Res. 76, which provides $225 million in emergency supplemental funding for the Secretary of Defense to provide to the Government of Israel for the procurement of the Iron Dome defense system to counter short-range rocket threats in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. This funding will ensure that Israel will be able to sustain production of Iron Dome components in order to maintain adequate stockpiles of Iron Dome interceptors and equipment, consistent with the July 22, 2014, letter from the Secretary of Defense supporting Israel's recent request for $225 million in additional funding for Iron Dome. These funds are in addition to the $176 million requested in the President's FY 2015 budget for Iron Dome and the FY 2015 Congressional increase of $175 million proposed in Congress to offset the costs of initiating Iron Dome production in the United States.
The United States is proud that the Iron Dome system developed in coordination with Israel and funded by the United States has saved countless Israeli lives. Continued bipartisan support for Iron Dome funding ensures Israel will retain vital defense against rockets and artillery in light of the enduring threats.
The United States has been clear since the start of this conflict that no country can abide rocket attacks against its civilians. The United States supports Israel's right to defend itself against such attacks. We also continue to call on Israeli authorities to take all feasible precautions to prevent civilian casualties in Gaza and protect the civilian Palestinian population from the effects of attacks, and we continue to stress that all parties to the conflict must comply with international humanitarian law.
