    TWO NEWSPAPER ENDORSEMENTS: The Portsmouth Herald & Foster's Daily Democrat Support Gov. John Kasich for President
Today two New Hampshire newspapers, The Portsmouth Herald and Foster's Daily Democrat, endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich's campaign for President. The endorsements are the latest in a growing wave of New Hampshire support for Kasich and come in the wake of four polls in the past week showing Kasich running 2nd in the state.
The endorsement reads:
"In a race awash in half-truths and exaggerations, Kasich can stand on his record of accomplishment without the need to embellish it...Of all the Republicans running for president, none can match Kasich's record of accomplishment. His experience prepares him better than all other GOP primary candidates to be an effective and successful president."
