    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit a report by the Acting Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, in regard to the application of the British Embassy in behalf of Messrs. Gordon, Ironsides & Fares Company (Limited), of Canada, for reimbursement of $7,626.08, which they allege the United States customs authorities improperly exacted of them in November, 1902, as duties on certain sheep and cattle.
In view of the facts as recited by the Acting Secretary of State and shown in the correspondence, I recommend that provision be made for the company's reimbursement.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
