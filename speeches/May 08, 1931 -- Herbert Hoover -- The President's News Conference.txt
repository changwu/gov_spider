    PUBLIC BUILDING PROJECTS
THE PRESIDENT. I have two or three inquiries from the press and some from associations as to the progress of the building program of the Treasury. We haven't had time to get the detail of it, but we will, sometime next week, be able to give you a list of all the buildings which have been authorized and what their status is on the road to construction.
The summary of the situation is that there are buildings which have been completed in the last 18 months or are under contract, 119 million; sites have been secured, plans have been made, specifications have been gotten out, and contracts will be let within the next 90 days for 58 million further. In the subsequent 90 days a still further 60 million will be let on contract, and in the further 90 days again 40 millions more. That is, within the next 6 months we will have completed or in actual construction under contract 277 million. It covers a total of about 395 different buildings. We will, however, in order that every community may know exactly where it stands, give you a list of all the buildings and exactly where we have got to as to securing the sites, plans, contracts, and everything.
DISTRICT COURT OF MARYLAND
The other item I have today is that Mr. Calvin Chesnut of Baltimore has been selected for the District Court to succeed Judge [Morris A.] Soper.
Further than that I haven't anything today.
