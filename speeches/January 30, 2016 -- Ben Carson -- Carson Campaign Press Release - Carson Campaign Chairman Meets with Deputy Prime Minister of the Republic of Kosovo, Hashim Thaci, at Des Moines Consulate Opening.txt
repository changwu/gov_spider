    Alexandria, Va. - January 30, 2016 - The Ben Carson for President 2016 Campaign Chairman, General Bob Dees, met with Hashim Thaci, Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosovo, on Friday. The two met at the opening of the Kosovar consulate in Des Moines, the first foreign consulate in Iowa. The new consulate highlights the special relationship between the Republic of Kosovo and Iowa.
The relationship began as a 2011 partnership between Kosovo Security Forces and the Iowa National Guard. The relationship strengthened in 2013, when Governor Branstad and President Jahjaga signed a sister state agreement, bringing the states closer together, both economically and culturally. Choosing Des Moines for Kosovo's consulate is a sign of just how strong this relationship has become, and further underscores the Republic of Kosovo's impressive recovery and growth after enduring civil war and genocide.
"Having served in Kosovo during my U. S. Army career, I was honored to represent Dr. Carson and the campaign, and delighted to meet with meet with Deputy Prime Minister Thaci," said General Dees. "I look forward to seeing even greater cooperation between Kosovo and the United States, and Iowa is the perfect state to be the bedrock of that relationship."
"Kosovo's history is a testament to the resiliency of its people," said Dr. Carson. "This new consulate also demonstrates that when the United States and its NATO allies commit to the fight for peace and liberty, it can have profound effects for victims of violence and oppression. All Americans should be proud to see this vibrant relationship that has developed between Iowa and Kosovo, and I look forward to seeing this friendship and cooperation grow in the years to come."
