    After a landslide victory in West Virginia, the Clinton Campaign today announced that former Kentucky Governors Wendell Ford, Paul Patton, John Brown, and Julian Carroll are endorsing Hillary for President. The endorsements demonstrate the widespread support Hillary continues to receive throughout the Bluegrass State.
"The Presidency is the hardest job in the world and the American people deserve a leader who can rise to the challenge," said former Governor Wendell Ford. "In the thirty years I have known Hillary, she has consistently proven she can deliver results. Whether fighting to reform our nation's health care system or offering a responsible solution to ending the War in Iraq, Hillary has proven time and again she has what it takes to get the job done."
"The people of Kentucky need a President who has the strength, experience, and leadership to lead on day one," said former Governor Julian Carroll. "My friendship with Hillary goes back more than 30 years and I know she'll make a fine President. Hillary is the leader that Kentucky needs and I look forward to helping deliver victory for her on Tuesday."
"I am proud to support Hillary today," said former Governor John Y. Brown. "I had the opportunity to serve with President Clinton and I got to know Hillary as a person. With the complex problems that have been created over the last eight years, I would feel most comfortable with Hillary because she has the skills and experience to handle them."
"I am honored to have the support of these distinguished Kentucky governors, and look forward to working with them to jumpstart the economy and rebuild the middle class," Clinton said.
