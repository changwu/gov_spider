    To the Commander-in-Chief, the Grand Army of the Republic:
Had circumstances permitted I would have been with you today in person. This being impossible, I have asked the Secretary of War to add to his own message to you a personal word from me.
You have lived to see the Nation face the profound problems of an unprecedented world-wide depression which has overthrown the Governments of many another Nation. How deep must have been your pride to see with what solidarity our united people met the demands of these difficult years. You are fortunate indeed to have lived to see the end of sectionalism and the final healing of the scars of conflict, and the achievement of a true unity of national purpose.
