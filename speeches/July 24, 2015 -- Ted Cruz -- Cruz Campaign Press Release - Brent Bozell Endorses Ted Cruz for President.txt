HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today received the endorsement of Brent Bozell, conservative stalwart and president of the Conservative Victory Committee. Bozell released the following video announcing his support of Sen. Cruz's candidacy for President:


"Make no mistake: If the Republican Party repeats what it has done the last two presidential elections, Republicans will lose. I guarantee it," Bozell said in the video. "On the other hand, if we nominate a principled, passionate conservative America can count on to restore her greatness, there will be an outpouring of support."
Bozell continues, "We need a courageous conservative who tells the truth and does what he promises. We need to nominate an inspiring leader who has proven he is willing to take on the Washington Cartel and buck the political establishment of both parties. We need a leader who will win, and reignite the promise of America. There are some good conservatives running for president, but we need more than a 'campaign conservative' – we need a consistent conservative who has led the fights important to us. Ted Cruz is this leader."
Brent Bozell III is one of the most outspoken and effective national leaders in the conservative movement today. He has spent more than three decades promoting and defending conservative values. He has built the largest media watchdog organization in the country, successfully exposing the mainstream media's biased coverage of conservative candidates and ideas. Additionally, he is founder of ForAmerica, an organization committed to restoring America to its founding principles with an online army of almost 8 million members, and previously served as president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee.
