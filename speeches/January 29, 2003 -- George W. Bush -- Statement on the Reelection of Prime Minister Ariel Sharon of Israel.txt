    I congratulate Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on his victory in Israel's elections yesterday. The friendship between the United States and Israel, and our commitment to Israel's security, remain firm. I look forward to continuing to work with Prime Minister Sharon and his new government in the search for peace and security for all Israelis and all Palestinians.
