    Atlanta, GA -- Newt 2012 National Security Advisor Stephen Yates shared the following statement in response to Senator Rick Santorum's criticism of Newt Gingrich's American space policy:
"I am deeply concerned that Senator Santorum so easily relinquishes space development to the Chinese and Russians.
"American success in space is not only about being the first to develop a station on the moon. It is just as much about the explosion of math, science, engineering and national security technology that will launch America into a new age of innovation and prosperity.
"We owe it to ourselves to set grandiose goals and then achieve them. It is the American way."
