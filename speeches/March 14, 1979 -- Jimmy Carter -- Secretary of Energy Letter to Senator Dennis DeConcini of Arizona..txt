    To Senator Dennis DeConcini
This is a response to your letter of March 12. While I welcome your views and recognize that the administration of the Department of Energy can always be improved, I continue to have full trust and confidence in Secretary James Schlesinger.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Dennis DeConcini, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510]
He has a very difficult job, and needs all the help and support he can get-He's got mineâ€”
