    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol Amending the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and Australia, signed at Seoul on September 4, 1990. I also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol supplements and amends the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and Australia, signed at Washington on May 14, 1974. It is designed to update and standardize the conditions and procedures for extradition between the United States and Australia. Most significant, it removes an outdated list of extraditable offenses from the 1974 Treaty and expands upon the dual criminality approach contained in that Treaty. The Protocol also provides a legal basis for temporarily surrendering prisoners to stand trial for crimes against the laws of the requesting State. The provisions in this Protocol follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
This Protocol will make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
