    The President has asked Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti to travel to the Netherlands tonight to appear personally before the International Court of Justice in the United States case against Iran.
The Court is holding hearings at The Hague Monday on the request of the United States for an interim order that Iran should immediately release and ensure the safety of the Americans held hostage in Tehran. In the view of the United States, the continued detention of the hostages is a gross violation of the basic rules of international law and human rights.
In light of the importance and urgency of this case, the President has asked the Attorney General personally to present the position of the United States to the Court. Roberts B. Owen, Legal Adviser to the Department of State, will also be appearing before the Court for the United States.
