    Mitt Romney today announced his Washington Grassroots Leadership Team.
"Washington State has felt the effects of President Obama's failed economic policies," said Mitt Romney. "It is imperative that we put in place policies that will reverse the failures of the last three years. I recently laid out my vision for creating jobs and shrinking government — with the help of this team and the support of Washingtonians we will be able to bring lasting, conservative change to Washington."
"Mitt Romney has laid out an economic plan that is being supported by conservatives in Washington because it is bold, comprehensive and will put Washingtonians back to work," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "The strong team that the campaign has put together in Washington is a sign that Mitt Romney is the candidate that conservatives are looking to in order to defeat President Obama and put in place policies that will allow job-creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs to thrive."
