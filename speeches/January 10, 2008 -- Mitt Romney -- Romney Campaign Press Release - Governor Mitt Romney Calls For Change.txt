Myrtle Beach, SC â€“ Tonight, Romney for President Communications Director Matt Rhoades released the following statement on the South Carolina Republican presidential debate:
"Tonight, Governor Romney won the debate by discussing the issues that are important to the American people. He was the only candidate to lay out the vision necessary for changing Washington and strengthening America. Our nation cannot afford to continue electing the same Washington insiders. Governor Romney also rejects the pessimism that would give up on lost jobs, abandon weakened industries and disregard states that are hurting. Governor Romney will take the action necessary to build a better future for all Americans."
