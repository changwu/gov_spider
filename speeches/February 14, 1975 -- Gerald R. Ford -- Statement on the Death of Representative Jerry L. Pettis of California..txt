    MRS. FORD and I were deeply grieved to learn of the plane crash that took the life of our old friend, Representative Jerry Pettis.
Jerry Pettis was more than just a Member of the House of Representatives. He also excelled as a rancher, teacher, aviator, religious leader, and businessman. Jerry brought the insights he gained in these varied fields to his work in the Congress and his position of leadership among House Republicans.,
It was my great privilege and pleasure to work closely with Jerry for 8 years-first as a colleague in the House, and then as President. I will miss his loyal support and wise counsel.
Mrs. Ford and I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Shirley, and to his family.
