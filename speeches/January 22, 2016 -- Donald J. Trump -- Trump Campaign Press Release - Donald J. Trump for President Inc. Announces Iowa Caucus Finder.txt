(New York, NY) January 22nd, 2016 — Today Donald J. Trump for President Inc. announced a new digital tool to help voters find their Iowa Caucus locations on Monday, February 1st.
The campaign stated, "The only way to ensure that Donald J. Trump will be our next President of the United States is to caucus for him on February 1st— the caucus process is very fast and easy, and we are here to help if you have any questions."
The Iowa Caucus Finder (also at https://www.donaldjtrump.com/iowa/caucus-finder) will show voters where to go on Caucus night. It also includes an instructional video on how what to do once you arrive at the pre-determined locations.
Mr. Trump continues to dominate all national and state polls including an 11 point lead in the most recent CNN/ORC poll in Iowa. He will be campaigning across the state for much of the next week and continues to encourage the thousands of Iowans attending each of his rallies to Caucus next Monday night.
