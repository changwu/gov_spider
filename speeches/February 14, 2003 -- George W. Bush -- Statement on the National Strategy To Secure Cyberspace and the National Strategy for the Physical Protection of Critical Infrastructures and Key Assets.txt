    The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets will help us protect America from those who would do us harm, whether through physical destruction or by attacking our infrastructures through cyberspace.
These strategies recognize that the majority of our critical assets and infrastructures, such as those in the banking, telecommunications, energy, and transportation sectors, are privately owned and operated. The strategies outline Federal efforts and State and local roles in securing the Nation's critical infrastructures and identify opportunities for partnership with the private sector. The Department of Homeland Security will take the lead in accomplishing many of the objectives of these strategies. Other departments and agencies also have important roles to play. I encourage everyone, government at all levels, industry, and private citizens to continue to work together to make our Nation secure.
