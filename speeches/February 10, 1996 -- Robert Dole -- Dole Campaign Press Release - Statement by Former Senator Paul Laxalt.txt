    "As someone who has had the privilege of knowing Ron Reagan since we worked together on Barry Goldwater's Presidential campaign, I am deeply disappointed that an ad being run by the Forbes campaign falsely implies that President Reagan endorses Mr. Forbes' candidacy.
"I was blessed to have been asked by Ron to serve as the national chairman of his three campaigns for the White House -- in 1976, 1980 and 1984. I think that I know him politically as well as anyone.
"Never have I seen him take a position in a Republican Presidential primary in which he was not involved. During a period when I formed an exploratory committee to consider running for President in 1988, the President told me personally that he would have to remain neutral. He indicated the same to his loyal Vice President, George Bush.
"Based on this history, I think it should be clear that President Reagan has not and will not endorse a candidate during the Republican primaries.
"President Reagan's commendatory remarks toward Mr. Forbes were among thousands of such statements issued by Ron before, during and after his Presidency. It is the ultimate stretch to suggest that these remarks, made some three years ago, are remotely associated with a Presidential candidacy.
"I think it is cynical and disingenuous for the Forbes media team to use my friend in political ads to imply something that is not true.
"I know that Bob Dole would not stoop to such tactics, and that is one of the myriad of reasons why I am strongly supporting Senator Dole's candidacy."
