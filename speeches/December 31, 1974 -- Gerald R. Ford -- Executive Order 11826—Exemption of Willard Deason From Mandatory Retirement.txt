    Willard Deason, Commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age during January of 1975 under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive order.
In my judgment, the public interest requires that Commissioner Deason be exempted from such mandatory retirement.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Willard Deason from mandatory retirement until December 31, 1975.
GERALD R. FORD
