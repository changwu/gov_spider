    New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte made the following statement on tonight's vice-presidential debate:
"Paul Ryan offered solutions while Vice President Biden tried to duck blame. He couldn't defend the failed Obama economy, which has buried America's middle class and left 23 million Americans struggling for work. While Biden delivered more misleading rhetoric, Paul Ryan told the American people how a Romney administration would get millions of jobless Americans back to work. And he was clear about the need to solve our debt crisis -- not hide from it, like President Obama has. The Romney-Ryan ticket is showing Americans that it has the right vision to grow the economy, create jobs, and get our fiscal house in order."
