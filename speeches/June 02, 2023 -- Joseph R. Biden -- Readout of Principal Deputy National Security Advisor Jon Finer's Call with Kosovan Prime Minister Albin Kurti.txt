    Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with Prime Minister Albin Kurti of Kosovo yesterday. Mr. Finer underscored the United States' concern about the tense situation in northern Kosovo and called for all parties to take steps aimed at de-escalating the situation. He urged the Government of Kosovo to enable newly elected mayors to carry out their duties from alternative locations and to withdraw police forces from municipal buildings. He also welcomed Prime Minister Kurti's willingness to work towards conditions for new elections. Mr. Finer reiterated that the United States expects both sides to re-engage in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and to fully implement the normalization agreement reached in Brussels and Ohrid earlier this year.
