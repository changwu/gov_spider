    Dear General Gruenther:
Your heartwarming preliminary report of our Nation's voluntary relief efforts in Chile was on my desk when I arrived home.
The total value of cash and supplies donated by our people was most gratifying to me. It symbolizes an even greater asset: namely, the united response of Americans--of all creeds and races--to their neighbors in need.
This great outpouring of charity has served as a most human supplement to the official relief actions taken by our Government on behalf of our stricken friends in Chile. I am sure it will help them to recover from the shattering effects of disaster. This whole experience serves to strengthen the bonds of affection and respect which unite our two countries.
I would like to make an additional comment about one section of your report which carried particular promise. That was the part dealing with the needs of the 80,000 stricken school children of Chile and the major effort by our young people on their behalf. I am proud that the youth of America are demonstrating their concern for these children. This is further proof that our best traditions are in good hands!
With warm regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
