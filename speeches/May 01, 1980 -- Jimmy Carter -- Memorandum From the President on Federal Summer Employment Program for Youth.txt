    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Youth employment is one of my top domestic priorities. For this reason I am asking Congress to enact the Youth Act of 1980, which will provide education and jobs for millions of disadvantaged youth. These new initiatives grew out of the work of the Vice President's Task Force and are intended to prepare young people for the labor market of the 1980's.
In the meantime, many young Americans will seek summer employment at the end of this school year. Some will need earnings from their jobs to help meet their educational expenses or to help out at home. Others will be looking for an opportunity to translate classroom theory into practical experience. Under the 1980 Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth, we can meet the aspirations of these young people.
The Federal government's outstanding reputation as an employer of students during the summer months has long set an example for private employers and for State and local governments. I am confident that once again Federal departments and agencies will support the summer employment program. Opportunities should be provided for students who have successfully competed in the summer employment written test, who have filed under agency merit staffing plans, or who are nominated by their schools under the Federal Summer Intern Program.
In addition to these programs, I am determined to see that Federal agencies do their part to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among needy youths this summer. For this reason, I am asking that one disadvantaged young person be hired for every 40 regular employees in each department and agency.
Alan K. Campbell, Director of the Office of Personnel Management, will provide guidance on all aspects of our Federal summer employment efforts and will report to me on the results. I know that I can count on your personal involvement and support in achieving a successful 1980 summer employment program.
