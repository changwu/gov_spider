    To the House of Representatives:
I communicate to the House of Representatives herewith a report to me, dated the 13th instant, from the Secretary of the Interior, respecting the delay and difficulty in making the apportionment among the several States of the Representatives in the Thirty-third Congress, as required by the act of 23d May, 1850, in consequence of the want of full returns of the population of the State of California, and suggesting the necessity for remedial legislation.
The subject is one of much importance, and I earnestly commend it to the early consideration of Congress.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
(The same message was sent to the Senate.)
