    Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) today announces the addition of Karen Fesler as National Caucus Coalitions Advisor. In this role, Fesler will work directly with National Political Director Jessica Colon to help coordinate coalitions in caucus states.
Rick Santorum said: "I am excited to welcome Karen Fesler back to our campaign team. Karen was an important part of our victorious 2012 Iowa Caucus campaign and she spearheaded our efforts to overwhelmingly win the 2012 Missouri Republican Caucus. I am confident that she will provide our campaign with great insights, advice, and a strong network to build our national campaign infrastructure."
Karen Fesler said: "Rick Santorum is a principled conservative who is prepared to lead our nation on day-one. He has always been a champion of hardworking families and he can be trusted to shake up the old boys network. I am excited to rejoin his team and help be a part of a campaign that will again prove the experts in Washington and New York wrong."
Karen Fesler has over three decades of political experience, first as a county coordinator for Governor Kit Bond's 1980 gubernatorial campaign. From 1996 to 2014, Fesler served as a District and State Delegate to the Republican Party of Iowa. From 2013 until 2015, Fesler served on the Iowa 2nd District Executive Committee, serving as Chair from 2014-2015.
During the 2012 presidential campaign, Karen Fesler was a member of the Santorum for President Iowa Steering Committee and later served as the campaign's Missouri State Director. Fesler has been named by POLITICO as one of their top 50 insiders in Iowa and she most recently served as State Co-Chair of Governor Rick Perry's 2016 presidential campaign.
