Watch Mitt Romney Discuss The Unemployment Report


MITT ROMNEY: "And, of course, today we just got a new number from the unemployment report and it's another hammer blow to the struggling middle-class families of America because the President has not had policies that put American families back to work. I do. I'll put them in place and get America working again. You know this. These numbers are not just statistics. These are real people really suffering, having hard times. 23 million Americans out of work, or stopped looking for work, or way underemployed. 23 million. The official unemployment number: 8.3 percent. That's the longest period of time, 42 months, the longest period of time we have had unemployment above 8 percent in American history. Since this has been recorded. This is an extraordinary record of failure. The President's policies have not worked because he thinks government makes America work. He's wrong. It's people like John that make America work."
