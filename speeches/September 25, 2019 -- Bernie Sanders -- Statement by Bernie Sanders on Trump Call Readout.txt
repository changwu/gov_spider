    BURLINGTON, VT â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Wednesday after the White House released a readout of President Donald Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky:
"Reading the transcript of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president confirms what we already know: Trump is abusing the powers of the federal government to help his re-election campaign. Trump's self-dealing and corruption is limitless, and the House is right to begin impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable."
