    Q. Mr. President, the Soviets have suspended their troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. How do you feel about that, sir?
The President. Well, I think we're all disappointed by that. At the same time, I think we could recognize, however, that this is something they themselves have said is temporary, and they have repledged themselves to totally bring their troops out by February 16th. So, I think we have to stand by that.
Q. Do you believe they're just covering their retreat, sir?
The President. This is what they may claim. They've said that they are still abiding by the February 15th.â€”
Q. Is the United States going to do anything about this, Mr. President?
The President. Well, I just learned about it on an airplane coming out. We haven't had a chance to sit down and talk this over, and all the details.
