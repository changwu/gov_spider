    President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda will lower health care costs for working families and reduce the number of uninsured Americans, according to multiple recent analyses.
On Friday, the actuarial firm Oliver Wyman released a new analysis showing that just one piece of the Build Back Better Agenda – extending the American Rescue Plan's (ARP) policy that is lowering premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage – would increase the number of people with coverage through the ACA by 7.4 million people. In fact, 4.1 million previously uninsured people would gain ACA coverage, and families would save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year on their premiums.
This analysis is consistent with similar work showing that the Build Back Better Agenda would make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. The Urban Institute estimated that extending the lower premiums from the ARP would reduce the uninsured by 4.2 million people. The Urban Institute has also shown that another key Build Back Better priority – closing the Medicaid coverage gap – would help about 4 million additional people to gain coverage.
These analyses make clear that the President's plan would expand health care access for American families by lowering costs – and bring us closer to realizing the President's vision that health care should be a right, not a privilege.
