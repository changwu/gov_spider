    Hillary for America Labor Campaign Director Nikki Budzinski released the following statement today, urging the Obama Administration against moving forward with final approval of Norwegian Air International's entry into the U.S. airline market. Norwegian Air International has been criticized for unfair labor practices that threaten American jobs:
"Workers in the U.S. airline industry deserve rules of the road that support a strong workforce with high labor standards -- not attempts by airlines to flout labor standards and outsource good-paying jobs. That's why our Open Skies Agreement with Europe explicitly calls for the maintenance of high labor standards to guide the parties in its implementation. Hillary Clinton urges the Obama Administration against moving forward with final approval of Norwegian Air International's application. Too many questions have been raised aboutÂ NAI's practices and plans."
