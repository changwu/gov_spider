    Q. Mr. President, what's your impression?
The President. Well, I'm deeply moved by this, deeply moved by it -- sad in some ways, and yet very stimulated by the team effort. You heard from the Congressmen, from the Governor, from Senator Wilson, from the mayor. And then you start talking to the local officials, the police officials and the sheriff's department, and the Red Cross. God bless the volunteers and our military. I'm very proud just of what I'm told by the officials -- the military just pitching in and doing.
And so, you have feelings of contradiction: one of great sadness and one of genuine appreciation for the way this community is pulling together -- this area of the State and, I'd say, the country. I think you've got a lot of people out there rooting for you. You've got a lot of them rooting for you. We'll see what we can do to be a part of the answer.
