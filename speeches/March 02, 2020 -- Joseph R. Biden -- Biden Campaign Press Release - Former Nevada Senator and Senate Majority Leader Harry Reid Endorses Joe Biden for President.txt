    Today, former Nevada Senator and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement announcing his endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"President Donald Trump has done unspeakable damage to our country, our institutions and the rule of law. Democrats need a candidate who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump's presidency. That candidate is Joe Biden.
"Joe Biden's strength of character and deep experience stand in the starkest contrast to Trump's amorality, corruption and utter incompetence. Biden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following Trump's disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to Trump's dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion. I believe Biden is best able to defeat Donald Trump and enact the policies we all care about.
"Our party was fortunate to have a tremendous field of talented candidates this year, many of whom are my close friends. I have the deepest respect and admiration for Senators Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar and Mayor Bloomberg. They're among the brightest leaders in our party, and they've made invaluable contributions to this race and our country."
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
