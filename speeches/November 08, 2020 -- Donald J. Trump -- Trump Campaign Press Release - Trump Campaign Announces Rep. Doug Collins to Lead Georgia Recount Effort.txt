    President Donald J. Trump's campaign today announced that Rep. Doug Collins (GA-9) will lead the campaign's recount team in Georgia, where a recount will begin as soon as the canvassing has concluded.
"We are concerned about the lack of transparency in the tabulation process, especially given the reports of irregularities and improper ballot harvesting in Georgia," said Matt Morgan, Trump 2020 general counsel. "In order for Americans to have full faith and confidence in our elections, every legal vote must be counted and every illegal or fraudulent vote must be excluded. We look forward to guaranteeing that our elections are safe and secure, just as we look forward to President Trump winning Georgia."
"Republicans stand by the ideal that every eligible voter should be able to vote legally and have it be counted," said Rep. Collins. "During the coming recount, we are confident we will find evidence of improperly harvested ballots and other irregularities that will prove that President Trump won Georgia fairly again on his way to re-election as President. Georgians deserve a free and open process, and they will get one."
