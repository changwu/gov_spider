    At the opening of his Greenville, SC campaign office, Newt slams the Obama administration for filing lawsuits on immigration against Arizona, Alabama, and South Carolina. Here's the transcript of Newt's remarks:
"I think it is astonishing that the Obama administration has now filed lawsuits on immigration against Arizona, Alabama and South Carolina, and that they have accepted foreign governments in the lawsuits. The whole purpose of creating the Constitution was to bind together the states so that foreign powers could not play us off each other. And, the Founding Fathers were very worried about foreign governments getting in the habit of playing us off each other.
Here is an Obama administration coming in and, in effect, creating dissension over their own failure. If the federal government were doing its job with immigration, there would be no South Carolina law because you wouldn't need one.
So, to have them accept foreign countries suing South Carolina instead of being on the side of the United States and stopping it makes me wonder what country Obama thinks he's president of."
