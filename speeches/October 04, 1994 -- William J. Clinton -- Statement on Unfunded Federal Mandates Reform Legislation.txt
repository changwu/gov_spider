    I want to state today my continued support for efforts by Congress to restore balance to the intergovernmental partnership between the Federal Government and State, local, and tribal governments. Since my days as Governor of Arkansas, I have spoken out on the need to address the burgeoning growth of Federal unfunded mandates. As President, I have taken action to resolve this problem within the executive branch by issuing Executive Order 12875, "Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership."
However, more needs to be done. Therefore, I want to reiterate my endorsement of and strongly encourage the Congress to send to my desk before the session ends, the bipartisan "Federal Mandate Accountability and Reform Act of 1994." This legislation, drafted by Senator Glenn and Senator Kempthorne in close consultation with my administration, will curtail the imposition of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate Federal funding and will promote informed and deliberate decisions by Congress on the appropriateness of Federal requirements in any particular instances.
