    Romney believes "words have meaning," yet he deletes his own words
 
Mitt Romney has an integrity problem, as evidenced in the video, "Words Have Meaning"


 
Mitt Romney is trying to run from the fact that President Obama used Romneycare as the model for Obamacare.
"Mitt Romney may try to edit his past, but he can't - President Obama followed Mitt Romney's model of Romneycare when he designed Obamacare," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. "Americans are looking for a proven and authentic conservative, not someone who changes his policies based on the 'climate.' "
Consider these facts:

Mr. Romney bragged about Romneycare being a national model in his book, No Apology, published in March 2010: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country." Mr. Romney deleted this Romneycare brag from the paperback version of, No Apology, published in Feb. 2011.

In last Thursday's Fox News debate, Mr. Romney claimed to stand by his words: "I know what I stand for. I've written it down. Words have meaning." He also said: "Please don't try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book. I stand by what I wrote. I believe in what I did. And I believe that the people of this country can read my book and see exactly what it is."

On Fox News last Friday, Mr. Romney's spokeswoman admitted No Apology was changed, attributing the rewrite to "changes in the climate." She also falsely claimed No Apology was written before Obama's $800 billion stimulus was passed, when the truth is the stimulus passed in Feb. 2009 and No Apology was published in March 2010.
