    I HAVE approved H.R. 5463, a bill establishing for the first time in our history uniform rules of evidence on the admissibility of proof in Federal court proceedings.
Enactment of this code culminates some 13 years of study by distinguished experts on the Federal judicial system. It will lend greater uniformity, accessibility, and intelligibility to Federal rules of evidence.
I salute the efforts of the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence and the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, the members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, the members of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, and officials of the Department of Justice. Their joint efforts in a healthy spirit of compromise were essential to the completion of this new legal legislation.
