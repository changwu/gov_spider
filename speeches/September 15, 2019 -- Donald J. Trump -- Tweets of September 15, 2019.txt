Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner the LameStream Media are after Brett Kavanaugh again talking loudly of their favorite word impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!Retweets: 20206Favorites: 77754

Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!Retweets: 7236Favorites: 25677

Can't let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?) false allegations and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaughRetweets: 20154Favorites: 69000

Mr. President We Are With You The Entire Way. REPUBLICANS Have....Coalesced Around Trump.'.....Retweets: 13491Favorites: 55427

Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!Retweets: 23779Favorites: 87994
