    During this year's Small Business Week, elected officials and business leaders are highlighting how tax reform and deregulation are helping small businesses thrive under President Trump.
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP COMMITTEE SEN. JIM RISCH (R-ID) IN THE HILL: The Incredible State of Small Business in America
"This small business week, however, is different from years past. Small business optimism is at record high thanks to tax reform and other policy changes coming out of Washington. Our economy is finally back on track after years of slow growth and a stagnant economy. Today's small business owners and American workers are getting the relief they deserve from uncertainty and over-regulation. Small business owners are experiencing one of the best and most small business-friendly economies in recent U.S. history."
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE REP. STEVE CHABOT (R-OH) IN THE HILL: For America, Small Business Is a Big Deal
"The fact is, when small businesses are strong, America is strong. Just ask Sheffer Corporation's CEO and President, Jeff Norris, from Blue Ash, Ohio, on the border of my district, who was able to give all 126 employees $1,000 bonuses, or Julia Mueller, an employee of First Communications in Fairlawn, Ohio, who broke out into tears when she heard that she, too would benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."
SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD) AT FOX NEWS: Our Small Businesses Are Finally on a Level Playing Field â€“ Now Watch What Happens
"We've had significant successes in enacting pro-growth policies over the past 16 months. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by President Trump late last year, has simplified the tax filing process and is allowing individuals and small businesses to keep more of their own money. With a lower tax rate, small businesses have additional resources available that they can use to grow and expand their operations."
REP. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD) IN ARGUS LEADER (SIOUX FALLS, SOUTH DAKOTA): Tax Policy, Deregulation Is Energizing the Economy
"I've fought to replicate our successful, limited-government model in the U.S. House, working closely with President Trump to cut taxes and red tape. Last December, President Trump signed the largest overhaul of the federal tax code since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. That legislation offered small businesses a 20 percent tax deduction for the first time in history."
REP. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK) IN SKIATOOK JOURNAL (SKIATOOK, OKLAHOMA): The Small Business Boom
"Small business optimism is at its highest point in more than 30 years, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Much of this optimism can be attributed to President Trump's regulatory and tax reforms. President Trump is rolling back harmful regulations put in place by the Obama administration and creating a pro-growth environment for America's job creators."
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS PRESIDENT AND CEO JUANITA DUGGAN IN THE HILL: Tax Reform Drives Record Optimism and Plans to Expand Among Small Businesses
"When President Trump signed The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in December, it was the biggest tax overhaul in more than three decades, and it dramatically changed the landscape for many small businesses. Since the enactment of the tax law, the tangible effect has been remarkable and historic. Small and independent business owners are notably confident about the economy. They are reporting that sales are strong, profits are good, and employee compensation is increasing. And many are setting into motion plans to expand."
JOB CREATORS NETWORK PRESIDENT AND CEO ALFREDO ORTIZ AT THE DAILY CALLER: Small Businesses Celebrate National Small Business Week
"Small business sentiment is at a record high, and taxation doesn't even rate as a major concern. This is something to celebrate during National Small Business Week this week. Though largely overlooked by the media, the tax cuts signed into law late last year delivered the biggest small business tax cut in U.S. history."
FLORIDA SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MICHAEL PLUMMER IN TALLAHASSEE DEMOCRAT: Trump Talks Taxes, Small Businesses Respond
"To coincide with Tax Day earlier this month, President Trump visited Florida to discuss his recently passed tax cuts and the impact they are having in South Florida and across the country. There's plenty to celebrate. Small business owners get a new 20 percent tax deduction as part of the tax cut, the biggest small business tax cut in the country's history. This will allow the small business and sole proprietor backbone of the Florida economy to reinvest more of their earnings into new product lines, new locations, and new employees."
