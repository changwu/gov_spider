    I leave Brazil impressed and reinvigorated. I have felt the warmth and energy of the Brazilian people and their dedication to peace and freedom.
My meetings with President Figueiredo and his ministers were successful in spirit and substance. We conducted serious discussions about the international systems of trade and finance and the difficulties both our countries face in this period of slow economic growth around the world. We discussed the importance of trade and free markets to bring lasting growth. For my part, I've gained a deeper understanding of Brazil's perspectives.
President Figueiredo and I resolved to find mutually acceptable solutions to those areas where we have differences, and to remain open to possibilities for new cooperation, especially in the areas of scientific and military industry. I leave confident that Brazil, like the United States, has the skill and determination to work its way up to renewed growth and prosperity. When I arrived here I reminded President Figueiredo of the old saying, "Nothing stops Brazil," and now I know it's true.
We considered the threats to peace in the hemisphere and in the world, the dangers of a nuclear arms race, the crisis in the Middle East, and prospects in southern Africa. I confirmed our intention to maintain a strong defense as the best assurance of peace for us and our friends.
I made clear to President Figueiredo our desire to continue close consultations with him. Of course, there are issues on which we have differences. But our mutual interest in cooperation is infinitely stronger. I hope that my visit has helpedâ€”in the same way that President Figueiredo's visit did-to improve an already warm relationship.
On behalf of our entire delegation, I want to thank you and all the Brazilian people for the wonderful hospitality you showed US.
Since I hope this meeting will not be our last, let us not say adeus, but ate logo. We go with the spirit of your friendship tucked close to our hearts.
