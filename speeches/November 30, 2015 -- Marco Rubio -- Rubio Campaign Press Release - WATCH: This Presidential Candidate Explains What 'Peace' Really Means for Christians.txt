His comments, captured by David Brody of CBN News, are quickly making the rounds online. Here's part of what he had to say:
A lot of people think 'peace' means like, "peace" [displays peace sign], like the hippie peace, or peace like no one's shooting at each other, or peace like everything's happy. Â That's not peace.
True peace is it doesn't matter what's happening. The winds could be swirling and Jesus is asleep on the boat, not worried about a thing, that's peace. The peace is in knowing that two things are going to happen anytime you face adversity. One is God is going to shield you from the adversity. He's going to protect you from it, and the other is God's going to make you go through the adversity, but He's going to give you what you need to get through it.
Earlier this month, a video of Marco discussing how faith can overcome doubt and anxiety went viral.
