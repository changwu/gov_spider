    Today, Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"It was Vice President Joe Biden who passed the Violence Against Women Act and paved a safe pathway for the women I represented in domestic violence cases after graduating from law school and becoming an Assistant State's Attorney. His leadership style is one that I aspire to each day, which is based on enduring compassion for those we serve, the innate desire to give back to the communities we love, and the determination to ensure that when our terms of office have ended, we have left the government better than we found it. Our nation is in the midst of trying times, and we need strong leadership to protect and restore our values, the foundation our country was built upon, and our integrity. Joe Biden will be a President that we can be Prince George's Proud of."
More than 30 former and current elected officials in Maryland have endorsed Biden, including former Congressman Aly Wynn and State Senate Democratic Caucus Chairman Jim Rosapepe. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
