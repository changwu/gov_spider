    Mt. Pleasant, SC - Today in Texas, national conservative leaders united behind the candidacy of Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum. Rick Santorum made the following statement in response to the outpouring support.
Rick Santorum said: "This is an endorsement that was coveted by every campaign, and I am deeply honored by their support - it is a great day for our campaign. The process has worked, the voters have gotten a chance to hear from every candidate and explore their records. This endorsement is another indication that it is time to coalesce behind the full spectrum conservative in this race who will fight for their values and won't waiver when times get tough. Now is the time to stop a moderate from becoming our Party's nominee and to unite behind the one candidate who draws the sharpest contrasts with Barack Obama. I am thankful for this outpouring of support and for the momentum that is building behind our candidacy. Together, in the Fall, we can defeat Barack Obama and restore America."
