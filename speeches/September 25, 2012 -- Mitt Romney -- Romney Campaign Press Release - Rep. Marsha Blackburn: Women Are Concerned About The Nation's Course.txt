    Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn today made the following statement on Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter's comments that women aren't concerned about what's happened over the last four years: Â 
"The question that every incumbent president must answer is whether the American people are better off than they were four years ago. President Obama is running away from that question. His Deputy Campaign Manager claimed that the women aren't 'really concerned about what's happened over the last four years.' She couldn't be more wrong. Women are very concerned about our soaring deficit, about unemployment that has been above 8 percent for 43 straight months, about rising poverty and plummeting opportunities for our young people, and about the course our nation is on because of the failed policies of this president. President Obama may think that women are not engaged on the issues of the day, but he is sadly mistaken. We have been watching, and we have been just as disappointed by this President's failures as all Americans have been. In November, the President will see just how much we care about the broken promises of his four years in office."
