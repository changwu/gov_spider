    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement today on Mitt Romney's economic plan:
"Mitt Romney's bold pro-growth plan is exactly what our country needs to get Washington out of the way, grow the economy, and create jobs. In states like Virginia, we have been able to put conservative principles to work to foster an environment where innovators and entrepreneurs can thrive and businesses can create jobs. These principles are at the center of Mitt Romney's comprehensive plan to fix our economy. I applaud him in this effort. This is the positive, innovative vision we need to get our economy back on track and Americans back to work."
