    MANCHESTER â€“ Bernie 2020 announced Thursday it has 45 staffers on the ground in New Hampshire, the majority of which are focused on field and community organizing. The campaign will also be opening field offices in Manchester, Portsmouth, Dover, and West Lebanon. The Greater Nashua field office was opened last month with Sen. Sanders and Campaign Co-Chair Ben Cohen. Including campaign headquarters, NH for Bernie now has six offices throughout the state.
"From day one of this campaign, I have said we will take nothing for granted here in the first-in-the-nation primary. We're building out the organization we need to talk to every Granite Stater in every corner of New Hampshire and earn their vote. I'm proud of the team we put together," said Joe Caiazzo, State Director.
