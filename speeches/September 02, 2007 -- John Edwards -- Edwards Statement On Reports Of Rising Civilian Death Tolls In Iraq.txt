    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement regarding today's news reports that civilian deaths in Iraq rose in August to their second-highest monthly total this year.
"Today we have further evidence that there appear to be two realities in Iraq: the harsh reality of worsening violence, more civilian deaths and the failure to achieve any political progress, and the rosy reality that President Bush and his cronies try to paint with baseless exaggerations. The fact is the surge isn't working. Too many innocent Iraqi civilians and too many of our brave American soldiers are dying everyday. All because this president refuses to be straight with the American people.
"This isn't a political game – it's a war. The president needs to face the harsh reality his mistakes have helped create. And it's time for Congress to have some backbone and put an end to it. That's why I've made my position very clear, with respect to the president's new funding request. We need a timeline for withdrawal and a focus on a comprehensive political solution that will stabilize the country.
"When Congress returns this week, their message to the Bush Administration must be clear and strong, without equivocation: no timetable, no funding. No excuses."
