    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Rep. Carper (D) Delaware and 29 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3025 because the bill contains a provision which would authorize the Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission (ASLLRWC) to enforce Federal law.. Under this provision the Commission members, who are appointed by the ASLLRWC member States, would be operating in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the Commission members would not be appointed by the President.
If H.R. 3025 were presented to the President in its current form, the Department of Justice would recommend that it be disapproved.
