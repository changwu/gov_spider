    I am pleased that Bob Rubin has accepted the job as chairman of the board of LISC. This service is consistent with his longstanding commitment to bring economic opportunities to America's most underserved communities. His selection is not only a tremendous boost for LISC but also for those who advocate community economic development to ensure that all Americans share in our economic prosperity.
