    Today, Senator Kamala Harris received the endorsement of former state Representative I.S. Leevy Johnson. Johnson was the only Black member of his University of South Carolina law school class of 1968 and the first Black student to complete all three years of law school at USC. In 1985, he ascended to become the first Black President of the South Carolina Bar Association. Johnson, along with two other candidates, made up the first cohort of Black candidates elected to the General Assembly since Reconstruction. Due to his transformational work, Governor Jim Hodges awarded Johnson the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian honor. Johnson also served as the chairman of the Richland County Democratic Party
"I'm honored to have I.S. Leevy Johnson's endorsement in this race," said Kamala Harris. "He has broken barriers in the legal profession and lifted up young leaders as he rose to become the first Black president of the South Carolina Bar Association. I'm proud that this campaign reflects the diversity of this country and I'm excited to have such an accomplished fighter for racial equity and justice join our team in South Carolina."
"Watching Kamala Harris in action, I am convinced she is the best candidate for President," said I.S. Leevy Johnson. "As the first Black woman to become Attorney General of California and only the second Black woman to become a United States Senator, she has already made history and will do the same as our next President. I'm proud to endorse her because she has the vision to tackle our country's most pressing issues -- from raising teacher pay to ending the epidemic of gun violence."
