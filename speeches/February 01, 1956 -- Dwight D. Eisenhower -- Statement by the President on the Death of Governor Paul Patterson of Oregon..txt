    I WAS DEEPLY SHOCKED and distressed to learn of the sudden, tragic passing of Governor Paul Patterson. He was a distinguished citizen, dedicated to the service of his fellowmen. I was privileged to call him my good friend. Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our sincere sympathy to Mrs. Patterson and the members of the family.
