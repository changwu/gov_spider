    ROCK HILL, S.C. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Friday welcoming President Barack Obama's decision to reject an application to build the Keystone XL pipeline:
"Climate change is a global environmental crisis of huge magnitude. It is insane for anyone to be supporting the excavation and transportation of some of the dirtiest fuel on earth. As someone who has led the opposition to the Keystone pipeline from Day 1, I strongly applaud the president's decision to kill this project once and for all."
