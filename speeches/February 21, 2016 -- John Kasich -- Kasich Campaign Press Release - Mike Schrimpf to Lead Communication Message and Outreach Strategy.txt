    KASICH FOR AMERICA ANNOUNCES VETERAN GOP COMMUNICATOR MIKE SCHRIMPF TO LEAD STRATEGIC MESSAGE DEVELOPMENT AND OUTREACH
Today Kasich for America welcomed veteran GOP communication advisor Mike Schrimpf to its team to serve as communication director. Schrimpf will oversee strategic message development and coordinate communication outreach with in-state political teams as well as the campaign's national leadership team.
Schrimpf previously served as chief communicator for Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner. He served in a similar capacity in Rauner's 2014 campaign and also served in senior communication positions for the Republican Governors Association.
"Mike has worked well with our organization for many years at RGA and will be a good fit with the team as Governor Kasich's growing support creates new opportunities for us to talk about his positive, unifying vision for America. He is an excellent communication thinker and leader who knows how to work effectively in senior positions with large teams and we're fortunate to have him join the campaign," said Campaign Manager Beth Hansen.
Mike is the twin brother of Chris Schrimpf who serves as senior communication advisor and travels with the governor to direct his personal communication activities.
