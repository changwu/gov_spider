The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!Retweets: 6739Favorites: 23968

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTRetweets: 5678Favorites: 19859

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Retweets: 33678Favorites: 87337

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Retweets: 6644Favorites: 21513

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Retweets: 10994Favorites: 29097

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!Retweets: 9109Favorites: 27352

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!Retweets: 9571Favorites: 29158

Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Retweets: 7067Favorites: 24301

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Retweets: 7457Favorites: 25061

The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!Retweets: 9400Favorites: 30900

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildRetweets: 11340Favorites: 32450

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outRetweets: 5500Favorites: 19848

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Retweets: 8118Favorites: 28299

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Retweets: 13136Favorites: 35108

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!Retweets: 9502Favorites: 30435

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!Retweets: 5986Favorites: 29413
