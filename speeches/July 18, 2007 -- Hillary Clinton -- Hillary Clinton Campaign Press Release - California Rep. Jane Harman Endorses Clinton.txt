    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of California Congresswoman Jane Harman, demonstrating Hillary's growing support in the Golden State. Congresswoman Harman privately endorsed Hillary at an event in Aspen, Colorado, on July 7.
"Hillary's strength and experience make her uniquely qualified to be Commander in Chief and deliver the change Americans want," said Congresswoman Jane Harman. "She will hit the ground running with Congress on her first day, and understands how to deal with the threats America faces.
Congresswoman Harman was first elected to the House in 1992 and has become a leading voice on national security issues, playing a pivotal role in the creation and passage of the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, and authoring the SAFE Ports Act of 2006.
In addition to her work to bolster our Homeland Security, Harman has been a champion of the environment, opposing drilling off the coast of California and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Now in her seventh term, Harman is a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and Chair of its Intelligence, Information-Sharing & Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee. She also serves on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee.
Prior to her election to Congress, Harman worked as an attorney, served as deputy secretary to the Cabinet in the Carter White House and as special counsel to the Department of Defense. Harman began her career on Capitol Hill as chief counsel and staff director for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights.
"Jane has led the fight to make us more secure at home without sacrificing our values," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have her support, and I look forward to working together to bring an end to the war in Iraq and begin repairing our alliances abroad." ###
