    Urbandale, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement in response to President Obama's "Aloha" wishes to the media before heading off to Hawaii for the holidays:
"Mr. President — We just left Chariton, Iowa, where I talked with a businesswoman with tears in her eyes who was worried about losing her business due to your failed economic policies. While you travel to Hawaii to enjoy the holidays, many Americans will have no Christmas at all because of your failed policies.
"President Obama is out of touch with the people; as he extends 'Aloha' wishes, Americans are ready to bid him 'Goodbye' in November of 2012."
