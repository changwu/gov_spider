    Dolores Huerta, an iconic civil rights and labor leader, is endorsing Senator Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. Huerta co-founded the United Farm Workers with Cesar Chavez and has dedicated her life to fighting for the rights of workers, immigrants, women and LGBTQ people. She joins Congresswoman Barbara Lee as a California Co-Chair of Harris's campaign.
"I have spent my career advocating for workers' rights, immigrants' rights, women's rights, and on behalf of the LBGTQ community because I believe our country is only as great as the opportunities we afford all our communities. Senator Kamala Harris is the right leader to expand those opportunities as president, and I am proud to endorse her," said Huerta. "For her entire career, she has fought on behalf of and given voice to the vulnerable from creating innovative programs to help first-time offenders get education and job training to avoid recidivism, to demanding that California and our country protect immigrant communities and afford them the opportunity to fully contribute to the country they love. Her leadership and strength are desperately needed at a time of great division and fear in America, and her vision of uniting a new majority of this country behind a bold, progressive, inclusive agenda is exactly what we should hope for from the next President of the United States."
Huerta, who lives in Bakersfield, joins California Members of Congress Nanette Barragan, Katie Hill, Barbara Lee, and Ted Lieu, as well as 21 members of the California State Senate Democratic Caucus including Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins, in endorsing Harris's campaign.
