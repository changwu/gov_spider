    The Administration's announcement today of a proposed rule on Title X family planning program fulfills President Donald J. Trump's promise to continue to improve women's health and ensure that Federal funds are not used to fund the abortion industry in violation of the law.
The President is pleased to support the proposed rule from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which would update the regulations governing the Title X family planning program. This important proposal would ensure compliance with the program's existing statutory prohibition on funding programs in which abortion is a method of family planning. The new proposed rule would not cut funds from the Title X program. Instead, it would ensure that taxpayers do not indirectly fund abortions. Contrary to recent media reports, HHS's proposal does not include the so-called "gag rule" on counseling about abortion that was part of the Reagan Administration's Title X rule.
