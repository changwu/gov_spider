    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Oberstar (D) Minnesota)
The administration opposes H.R. 389, because (1) increasing the appropriations authorization for State grants while reducing the authorization for the Federal timber management program is unwarranted and inappropriate; (2) if additional funds were appropriated for such State grants, they would either reduce funds available for other State and private forestry assistance programs or increase the deficit, neither of which is justified by this low priority program; and (3) it would be particularly unfair to increase this State grant, since no other State forestry program receives such Federal grants.
