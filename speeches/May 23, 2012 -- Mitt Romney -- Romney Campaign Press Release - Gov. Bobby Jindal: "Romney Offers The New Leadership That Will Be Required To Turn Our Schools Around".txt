    Today, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal made the following statement on Mitt Romney's proposals for reforming education:
"President Obama came into office with big promises to bring education reform to this country. Unfortunately, his administration has failed to deliver the better schools that our children deserve and our economy needs. Instead of standing up to labor bosses who put unions ahead of students, the President continues to cave to their demands. Mitt Romney offers the new leadership that will be required to turn our schools around. He will reform education in this country by promoting greater school choice, holding schools accountable, and attracting the best teachers. At a time when test scores show our children falling behind their counterparts around the world, we desperately need an education system that adequately prepares them to compete in the global economy. Governor Romney has spent his career turning around struggling enterprises and I'm confident he is up to the task of repairing our broken schools."
