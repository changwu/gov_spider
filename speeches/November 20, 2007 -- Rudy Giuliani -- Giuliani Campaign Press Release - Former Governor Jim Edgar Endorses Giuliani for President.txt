    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of former Illinois Governor Jim Edgar. Edgar served two terms as Governor of Illinois.
"I believe Mayor Giuliani is the best candidate to help the Republican Party win the White House in 2008. The reasons are clear that Rudy is a leader with a proven track record and offers successful executive experience. As Mayor, he cleaned up New York and his record as a fiscal conservative and crime fighter make him our best candidate to win the general election," said Governor Edgar. "I am proud to offer my endorsement for President to Mayor Rudy Giuliani."
"As the Illinois primary gets closer, Republicans in the state continue to join Rudy's team. We have a strong network in the state, which will only grow stronger with the addition of Governor Edgar," said Giuliani State Chairman Tom Cross.
Governor Edgar joins several respected Illinois Republican leaders who have endorsed Mayor Giuliani including former Governor Jim Thompson, former Attorney General Jim Ryan, and U.S. Congresswoman Judy Biggert.
