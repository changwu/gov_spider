    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 1/26)(House)(Underwood (D) Guam and 6 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2144.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
HR. 2144 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would result in increased spending of less than $500,000 annually.
