    Mitt Romney today announced that longtime New Hampshire taxpayer advocate George Lovejoy has joined his campaign.
"For decades, George has been on the front lines of the fight to cut spending, reduce government and to preserve the New Hampshire Advantage," said Mitt Romney. "I am proud to have earned his support and pleased that he has decided to join my campaign to create jobs and reverse President Obama's reckless fiscal policies."
"This election is without a doubt the most important in my lifetime and in the history of our country. Winning this election must be the foremost goal of every Republican, and I determined that I would support the most conservative candidate who could defeat Barack Obama in 2012. That candidate is Mitt Romney," said George Lovejoy. "Mitt has the successful business experience needed to lower spending and stop the taxing and borrowing of the Obama Presidency. He is on the right side of saving Social Security by fixing it instead of tearing it down. He will use this country's resources to stop illegal immigration and not offer illegal immigrants incentives to come here at the expense of our taxpayers. He has the stature, the respect and the knowledge to lead this country back to job and business growth and to turn around our struggling economy."
