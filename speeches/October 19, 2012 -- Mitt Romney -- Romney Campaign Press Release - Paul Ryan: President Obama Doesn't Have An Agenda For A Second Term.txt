What Mitt Romney did was offer ideas and solutions, how do we get the economy growing, how to turn things around." â€” Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "The President knew he had to up his performance but he did it more by attacking Mitt Romney more. You did not hear any vision for a second term agenda from the President. What you heard was just his attacks on Mitt Romney. He really didn't say, 'Here's how we're going to turn this country around, get things under control.' And what we know of his policies that if you stay with where we are that the debt is going to go to $20 trillion, you're going to have a $2 trillion tax increase, Obamacare gets fully implemented and all the collateral damage from that unfolds. So, we know what a second term agenda will look like based on the trajectory we are on, but he just doesn't even give a vision for that. I guess what we got was what I expected. He is going to try and win this election by tearing down his opponent, not by offering a positive vision or agenda for the next term. What Mitt Romney did was offer ideas and solutions, how do we get the economy growing, how to turn things around."
