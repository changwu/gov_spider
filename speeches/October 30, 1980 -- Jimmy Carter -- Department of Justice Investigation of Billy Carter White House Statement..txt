    No one at the White House has seen the report which the Office of Professional Responsibility in the Department of Justice has submitted to the subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary, concerning the conduct of the Justice Department proceedings against Billy Carter. Accordingly, we cannot comment on press accounts of what is said to be contained in the report.
We believe there is no basis for press accounts that the report makes a statement as to any lack of cooperation by the President or the White House staff.
The President and the White House staff have cooperated fully in Mr. Shaheen's investigation. All depositions requested from members of the White House staff have been taken, and access has been provided to their relevant records.
The President himself has also agreed to the interview requested by Mr. Shaheen. By mutual agreement, the holding of this interview has been deferred until the production and examination of all relevant White House records, including those of the President, have been completed.
It is true that arrangements were made to schedule the interview with the President on three dates in October, but each of these dates had to be postponed because the production and examination of relevant White House records had not been completed. When this is done, the interview with the President will be promptly scheduled.
