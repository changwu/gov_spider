    I have today signed into law H.R. 6585, which extends the President's reorganization authority under the Reorganization Act of 1977 for one more year, until April 6, 1981. The Congress has acted swiftly in extending this authority. I commend Representative Brooks and Senators Abraham Ribicoff and Jim Sasser for their leadership in facilitating its passage.
During the last 3 years, the reorganization plan has proved to be a valuable tool to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of Federal agencies. The extension of this authority for another year provides both the President and the Congress with the ability to deal with organizational problems in the Federal Government that can only be met through joint executive-legislative action.
In the last 3 years, nine reorganization plans have gone into effect. Those plans dealt with:
(1) reorganizing the Executive Office of the President;
(2) establishing the International Communication Agency;
(3) strengthening the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;
(4) replacing the Civil Service Commission with the Office of Personnel Management and the independent Merit Systems Protection Board;
(5) establishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
(6) carrying out the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA);
(7) establishing the Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System;
(8) establishing the International Development Cooperation Agency; and
(9) reorganizing our international trade functions under the new Office of the United States Trade Representative.
A 10th reorganization plan would improve the effectiveness of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That plan, which was developed as a result of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, is now under consideration by the Congress.
Again, I commend the Congress for its responsive action in passing this legislation.
