    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California)
The administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3189, but will work with the Senate to conform the authorization levels in the bill to those contained in the President's 1988 budget by:

— reducing the authorization level for the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment for fiscal year 1988 from $30 million to $17.5 million; and
— reducing the fiscal year 1988 authorization level for the National Center for Health Statistics from $55 million to $48 million. 
Moreover, the administration will work to delete the bill's provision prohibiting the Secretary of Health and Human Services from transferring the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology from its current organizational location in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.
