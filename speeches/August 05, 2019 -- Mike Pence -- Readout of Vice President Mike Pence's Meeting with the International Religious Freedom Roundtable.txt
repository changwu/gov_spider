    Vice President Pence met today with several champions of religious freedom. Joined by Ambassador for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, the Vice President reaffirmed the administration's commitment to stand with people of every faith in every country around the world, including in the People's Republic of China where the administration will continue to call upon Beijing to respect the rights enshrined in China's constitution to allow Muslim, Buddhist, and Christian believers throughout the country the freedom to practice their faiths.
