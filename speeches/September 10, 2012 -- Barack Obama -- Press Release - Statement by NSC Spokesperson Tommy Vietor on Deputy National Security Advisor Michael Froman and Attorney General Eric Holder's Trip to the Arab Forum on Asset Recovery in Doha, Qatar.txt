    Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs Michael Froman and Attorney General Eric Holder will lead a high level delegation consisting of officials from the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the National Security Staff to Doha, Qatar from September 11-13, for the inaugural Arab Forum on Asset Recovery. The United States is co-organizing the Forum with the government of the State of Qatar.
President Obama is committed to fighting corruption worldwide and supporting the democratic transitions that are taking place in the Middle East and North Africa. Corruption has been a core public grievance in the region, and the United States has worked closely with the new governments and citizens of Arab countries in transition as they fight corruption and seek justice by recovering stolen assets. As the president of the G8 in 2012, the United States is supporting these aspirations by leading a coalition to focus on asset recovery as part of the Deauville Partnership.
The Arab Forum on Asset Recovery will bring together the G8, the Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition, regional countries and international organizations to advance this work.
