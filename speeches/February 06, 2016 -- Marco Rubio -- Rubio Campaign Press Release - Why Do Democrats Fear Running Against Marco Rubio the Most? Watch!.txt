Last night, Marco was asked why he's the best Republican to beat Hillary.
Here's his answer:

First of all, I'm in the best position of anyone running to unify our party. We all have differences of opinion on some key issues in our party but I believe I'm best positioned to bring everyone together, because we cannot win if we're not all together. We also have to grow the conservative movement. We have to take our message to people who are living paycheck to paycheck. I've lived paycheck to paycheck. I grew up paycheck to paycheck. We're going to take the conservative movement to people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
We'll take it to young people, you know, you come to my rallies, there's a lot of young college students there, young Americans. A lot of them are worried about student loan debt. I had a student loan just three years ago, I still had one. So I think we can not just unify the conservative movement, we can grow the conservative movement.

Marco knows we can reach more voters.
Donate $17 to Help Grow the Movement
We can offer ideas that will create new opportunities in the 21st Century workforce. We can overhaul our broken higher education system and provide alternatives to student loans.That message can expand the movement, and that's why Marco is the candidate the Democrats fear the most.
