    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders watched the Republican presidential candidates' first debate on Thursday night and took to Twitter to share his impressions during the two-hour session.
He asked why Fox News, the debate sponsor, didn't even bring up issues that are priorities for big majorities of Americans: jobs, the collapse of the working class, tax breaks for the rich, raising the minimum wage, staggering student debt, climate change, the environment and billionaires trying to buy elections.
One of the most popular tweets of the night said:
GOP agenda: more money for military, tax breaks for the rich, cuts to Social Security & programs for working families. #DebateWithBernie

He was impressed a couple times.
Did @realDonaldTrump just support a national single-payer health system? Well. He was right on something. #DebateWithBernie

There was another thing he liked too, but it turned out to be a commercial.
Tom Hanks. Finally. Somebody who makes some sense. #GOPDebate #DebateWithBernie

Oh. It was just a movie trailer. #GOPDebate #DebateWithBernie

When the debate ended, Sanders summed it up in one final tweet:
It's over. Not one word about economic inequality, climate change, Citizens United or student debt. That's why the Rs are so out of touch.
