    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 407, a continuing resolution that includes funds to address the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Hugo and that provides funds to maintain the activities of the Federal Government through October 25, 1989, or until the date of enactment of pending appropriations bills, whichever occurs first.
The resolution provides $1.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide critically needed Federal disaster relief assistance to Charleston and other communities in South Carolina, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The assistance provided by these additional funds is imperative for those who are suffering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Hugo. I would like to commend the Congress for its immediate and compassionate response to the Administration's request for additional funds. Together with the other disaster relief programs of the Federal Government and the important contributions of State and local governments, private industry, and charitable organizations, these funds will help the victims of Hurricane Hugo rebuild their homes, communities, businesses, and lives.
I also want to commend the Congress for presenting me with a resolution that does not contain extraneous and unnecessary legislative provisions. This resolution is needed because the Congress has not completed action on all 13 appropriations bills, and funding for most Federal Government operations would otherwise expire on September 30, 1989. Although I support this resolution, I do not intend to support any extension beyond October 25. I expect that action on the remaining FY 1990 appropriations bills will be completed as expeditiously as possible and before expiration of this resolution.
