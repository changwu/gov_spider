    Chicago, IL -- On Saturday October 13, thousands of Obama supporters will go door-to-door to share Senator Obama's vision to turn the page in Iraq during a nationwide " Canvass for Change." Participants will gather in cities across the country to build a movement to change the way Washington works and to end the failed policies in Iraq.
These canvasses come less than two weeks after thousands of Obama supporters paid tribute to Senator Obama's judgment opposing the Iraq War in 2002 at Rallies for Change around the country.
"A grassroots movement across the country is rallying behind Senator Obama who, as the only candidate who opposed the Iraq War five years ago, has the best judgment to make the critical decisions of the future," said Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Steve Hildebrand. "Obama supporters are taking to the streets to let their neighbors know that together we can protect America and restore our standing in the world by electing Barack Obama as our next Commander-in-Chief."
A list of the planned canvasses is below. Supporters can RSVP for the canvasses online at my.barackobama.com/turnthepage and use the organizing tools on the site to plan canvasses in their home communities. The interactive map will allow supporters across the country to sign up for an event near their own home, create their own event, and invite friends and family to join the day of canvassing. The online site will also provide tools for the day of action including downloadable sign up sheets and a "how to" kit for participants.
