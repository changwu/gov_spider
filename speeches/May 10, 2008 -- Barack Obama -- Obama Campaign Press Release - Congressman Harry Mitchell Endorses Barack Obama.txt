    Chicago, IL - United States Congressman Harry Mitchell (D-AZ) endorsed Barack Obama for president today.
Congressman Mitchell is the 275th superdelegate to endorse Obama. Obama is 156 delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination.
Congressman Mitchell said, "I'm proud to support Barack Obama for President. Senator Obama and I worked together last year to improve care for our soldiers and veterans in the wake of the scandal at Walter Reed, and I know that, as President, he will work hard for our men and women in uniform. Like the primary voters of my congressional district, which Senator Obama carried, I am inspired by Barack's vision for America, his ability to unify our country and bring much-needed to change to Washington."
Senator Barack Obama said, "I am proud to have Congressman Mitchell's support. He has continued to build on his lifelong service to Arizona's families by fighting for more benefits for our veterans and military families and working for expanded educational opportunities for all of Arizona's children. As a former teacher, he knows that each of our students deserves a world-class education, and when I am president we will make this a reality. I thank Congressman Mitchell for his support and will work with him in the months ahead to bring about real change for families in Arizona and across the country."
