    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Swift (D) Washington and 28 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 2.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
