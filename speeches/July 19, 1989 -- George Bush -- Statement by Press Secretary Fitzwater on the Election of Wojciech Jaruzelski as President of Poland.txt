    We congratulate General Jaruzelski on his election to the Presidency of Poland. The choice of leadership is an internal matter for the Polish people. Our only concern is to see the political and economic reform process go forward, a point the President emphasized repeatedly throughout his trip.
The President was particularly struck by the overwhelming desire of the Polish people to work together to build a prosperous future. One of the goals of the President's trip was to express our hope that all the parties would take mutual action for the benefit of the Polish people.
