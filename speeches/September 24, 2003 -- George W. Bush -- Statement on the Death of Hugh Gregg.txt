    Hugh Gregg left an indelible mark on the State he loved and on the lives of the people of New Hampshire. He served his country in time of war and served his State with distinction as Governor, statesman, and successful business leader. In all of his endeavors, he acted with integrity and honor. He will be missed. Laura joins me in sending our condolences to his wife, Catherine, his two sons, and his family during this difficult time.
