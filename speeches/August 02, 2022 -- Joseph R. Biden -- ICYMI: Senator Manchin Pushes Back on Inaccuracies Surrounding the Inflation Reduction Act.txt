    In an interview with Fox News today, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia was clear that the Inflation Reduction Act would not raise taxes for those earning less than $400,000 a year, and would instead only raise taxes on Wall Street and corporations earning over $1 billion in revenue.
An excerpt of the interview is below:
The Faulkner Focus[Fox News, 8/2/22]
Harris Faulkner: I am asking you a different question than you're answering. I'm saying Americans $400,000 and below now are going to be taxed. Their taxes are going to go up.
Senator Manchin: That's wrong. That's a lie. That is a pure, outright lie.
Faulkner: So their taxes are not going to go up?
Senator Manchin: Not at all.
