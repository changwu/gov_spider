    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsor: Whitten (D), Mississippi)
The Administration understands that a joint resolution will be introduced today which simply extends continuing appropriations through November 26, 1991. The Administration supports passage of such a joint resolution.
The Administration believes that providing for the operations of the government through Continuing Resolutions is an undesirable practice. However, when a Continuing Resolution is unavoidable, it should contain only a simple, temporary extension of normal government operations without extraneous amendments. The joint resolution being considered today meets these criteria.
The Administration urges the House and the Senate to complete action on the regular FY 1992 appropriations bills prior to the expiration of this Third Continuing Resolution.
