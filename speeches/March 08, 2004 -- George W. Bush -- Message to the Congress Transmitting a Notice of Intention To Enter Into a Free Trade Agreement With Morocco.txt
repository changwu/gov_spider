    To the Congress of the United States:
Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107- 210; the "Trade Act"), I am pleased to notify the Congress of my intent to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with the Kingdom of Morocco.
This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, farmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade with Morocco. Morocco is one of the United States strongest friends in the Middle East. Increased trade will benefit Americans and help strengthen a tolerant, open, and more prosperous Morocco. Entering into an FTA with Morocco will not only strengthen our bilateral ties with this important ally, it will also advance my goal of a Middle East free trade area (MEFTA) within a decade.
Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at least 90 days in advance of signing the United States-Morocco FTA. My Administration looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate legislation to approve and implement this free trade agreement.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, March 8, 2004.
