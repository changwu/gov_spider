    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced Missouri House Majority Leader Steven Tilley has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. He will serve as the campaign's Missouri State Co-Chair.
Tilley also filed candidacy papers this morning with the Missouri Secretary of State's office on behalf of the Mayor.
"Mayor Giuliani has a strong record of fiscal discipline and lowering taxes, he is tough on crime and has shown the kind of strong leadership required to be the nation's top executive," said Tilley. "I am proud to be part of the Giuliani campaign in Missouri. I believe he is the best choice for Republicans to capture the White House in 2008."
"We're glad Steve has joined our Missouri team," said Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson, Giuliani's Missouri State Chair. "His endorsement demonstrates the Mayor's growing strength in the state. Steve will be a great supporter of Rudy's message of keeping America strong and safe and governing with fiscally conservative principles."
