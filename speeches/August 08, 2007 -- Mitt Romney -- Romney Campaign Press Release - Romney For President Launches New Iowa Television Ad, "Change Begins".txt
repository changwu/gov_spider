GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "Thousands of miles across Iowa for the Romney family, and the next miles take us to Ames for the Republican Straw Poll, Saturday the 11th.
"I hope you'll join us to send a message to Washington.
"Washington politicians in both parties have proven they can't control spending, and they won't control our borders.
