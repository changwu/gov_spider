    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revised(House)(Rep. Hamilton (D) Indiana)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2419, but will seek in conference to (1) modify section 104 to conform with the Administration's proposal because the provision unduly restricts the DCI's authority to adjust personnel ceilings in response to various contingencies; (2) delete section. 401, which requires congressional notification for intelligence-related expenditures in excess of authorized amounts and the transfer of certain defense articles because it restricts Presidential flexibility; and (3) delete section 402, which requires a counterintelligence vulnerability report, because this provision lacks adequate specificity and requires the report to be produced in-an unrealistically short time. In addition, the Administration will seek in Conference to restore certain program reductions to conform to Administration requests.
