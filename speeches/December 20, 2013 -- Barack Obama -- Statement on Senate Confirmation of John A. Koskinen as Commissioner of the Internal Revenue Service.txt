    I applaud the bipartisan majority of Senators who today confirmed John Koskinen as the next Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. John has decades of private and public sector experience, and he has led institutions in challenging times. Throughout his career, John has always acted with the absolute integrity Americans demand from those in public service, and his strong leadership and unquestioned expertise make him the right person to lead the IRS. I want to thank Daniel Werfel for his outstanding service as Principal Deputy Commissioner of the IRS, and I look forward to working with John as he takes on this new role.
