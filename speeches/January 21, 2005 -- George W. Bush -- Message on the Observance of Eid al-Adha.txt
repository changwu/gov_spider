    I send greetings to Muslims around the world as you celebrate Eid al-Adha.
Abraham's sacrifice and service to God teach us the importance of devotion, and God's mercy encourages us to share His blessings with others. The kindness and charity practiced by Muslims during this holiday strengthen friendships, help those in need, and exemplify the compassionate spirit that makes America and the world a better place.
As Americans of Muslim faith celebrate Eid al-Adha, our Nation is reminded of the contributions that Muslim Americans have made to our religious and cultural heritage. Your values of family, service, and community enrich our society and reflect the ideals on which our country was founded.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous celebration.
