Pool was led into room at 4:42 pm.
POTUS answered one covid related question on mask question.
"We follow the science."
He said experts are "looking at all the possibilities happening now. We have a pandemic of unvaccinated. If you're vaccinated you're safe."
"What they're doing is they're investigating any aspect of any change that could or might take place," he said.
POTUS had remarks at top on meeting. Please check quotes against transcript:
This is one of those meeting I've been looking forward to.
We're looking for a bipartisan effort to get this infrastructure bill passed
It's not about business vs labor. It's about the race to the future.
There's just a lot we can do to put people to work.

White House pool report #9 - fuller POTUS quotes and meeting participants 
Here are more quotes from the meeting and the one question POTUS answered at the end.
The question was: what conversations he's had with health officials about possibly changing the mask guidelines for vaccinated Americans.
POTUS response: "We have a pandemic among the non vaccinated. …If you are vaccinated, you are safe. If you're vaccinated, you have over a 98% chance of never catching the virus at all. If you catch it, you're likely, the overwhelming proof so far, is you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be sick, you're probably going to have no signs that you had it and you're not going to be die. It's a simple proposition. What they're doing is they're going to be investigating any aspect of any change that could or might take place. But the vaccine are good against all of the variants out there, including the delta variant."
POTUS on his meeting:
"This is one of those meeting I've been looking forward to. They're not here to negotiate with one another. … They're supporting what we're trying to get done in infrastructure. And I know that we're looking for this bipartisan effort to get this infrastructure bill passed. As you all know and they share my belief that it's both in the interest of business and labor to get this done. And it's about it's not about energy and that lot versus environment, business versus labor. It's all about basically a race to the future."
