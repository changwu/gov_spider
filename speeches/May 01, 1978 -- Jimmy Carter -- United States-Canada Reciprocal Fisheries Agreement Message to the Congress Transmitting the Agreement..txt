    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a Reciprocal Fisheries Agreement for 1978 between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada, effected by an exchange of diplomatic notes dated April 10 and April 11, 1978.
The Agreement, which continues through 1978 the provisions of the 1977 Reciprocal Fisheries Agreement with a few modifications, protects important United States interests in our fisheries off Canada and maintains the opportunity for conclusion of long-term maritime arrangements on boundaries, hydrocarbons and fisheries resources, including salmon, between the United States and Canada.
As was the case with the 1977 Reciprocal Fisheries Agreement, positive Congressional action is required to bring the 1978 Agreement into force. I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to the Agreement at an early date to establish the legal basis for the continuation of reciprocal United States-Canadian fisheries during 1978.
