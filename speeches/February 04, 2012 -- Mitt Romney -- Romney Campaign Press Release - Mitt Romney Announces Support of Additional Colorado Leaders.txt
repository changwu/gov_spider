    Mitt Romney today announced additional Colorado current and former elected leaders supporting his campaign.
"The endorsements by these leaders from all across Colorado are a sign that my message of smaller government is resonating with Coloradans," said Mitt Romney. "Colorado will be an important state in our efforts to bring conservative change to Washington. I look forward to working with these leaders in that effort."
Announcing his support, State Representative Kevin Priola said, "So many leaders in Colorado support Mitt Romney because he is the only candidate who will be able to fix the mess in Washington. President Obama came to Colorado four years ago and made promises to Coloradans that he has not kept. Instead of fixing our economy, President Obama has only grown government and made job creation more difficult. Mitt Romney spent most of his life in the private sector and knows how jobs are created because he has had one. He will use the lessons he learned in the private sector to grow our economy and bring jobs to Colorado. That is why I support Mitt Romney and urge Coloradans to support him Tuesday â€” our country deserves a leader like him."
