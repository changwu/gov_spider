    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Nowak (D) New York and 26 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4323 because the bill would impose unreasonable deadlines on the Environmental Protection Agency and certain States, and is inconsistent with the President's FY 1991 Budget.
The requirements for the development and adoption of specific numeric water quality criteria for the Great Lakes within strict timeframes is unrealistic. The lack of necessary flexibility could actually impede the ongoing efforts to develop and adopt water quality standards as required by the Clean Water Act. Further, the bill's FY 1991 authorization level of $30 million exceeds the President's recommendation by $18 million and creates an unwarranted new State grant program. Finally, the bill contains numerous provisions which would duplicate existing Clean Water Act authorities.
