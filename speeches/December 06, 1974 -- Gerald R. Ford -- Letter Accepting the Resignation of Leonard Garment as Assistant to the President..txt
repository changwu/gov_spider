    Dear Len:
I have your letter of December 2 and it is with deep regret that I accept your resignation as Assistant to the President, effective December 31, 1974.
In so doing, I welcome this opportunity to express my personal appreciation for your dedicated service to the Presidency and to our Nation. In particular, I want you to know of my gratitude for your highly capable assistance and unhesitating support during the early, critically important period of transition. Yours is an exceptional record of public service and one in which you can always take great pride and personal satisfaction.
You have my admiration and warmest best wishes for every happiness and success in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable Leonard Garment, The White House, Washington, D.C.]
