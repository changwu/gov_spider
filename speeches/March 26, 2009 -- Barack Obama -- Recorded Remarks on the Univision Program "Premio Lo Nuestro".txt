    Buenas noches [Good evening]. I want to thank the millions of you who voted for tonight's winners, and I also want to thank all of you who voted in that other election back in November - even if it wasn't for me. With the challenges we face right now, it is absolutely critical that you stay involved and make your voices heard. I want you to know that I will always be listening, and my Administration is working hard so that we can expand opportunity for all Americans and reach that better day. Now I know you tuned in for "Premio Lo Nuestro," so let me get right to it. I don't know who'll get married tonight or who'll get Video of the Year, but I know you're in for some great performances that celebrate the rich diversity of Latin music, and that's good news. So enjoy the show, y para los nominados que se preguntan si esta será su noche, les digo, ¡si se puede!
[and for all those nominees wondering if tonight is their night, let me just say, ¡yes you can!]
