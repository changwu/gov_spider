    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of former Governor Jeb Bush's Commissioner of Education Jim Horne. He joins the campaign's Northeast Florida leadership team.
Horne served in the Florida State Senate until he was appointed by Bush to serve as Florida's Secretary of Education. After a reorganization of the Florida education system, Horne was appointed to serve as the state's Commissioner of Education.
"On policies important to Floridians such as protecting our children and education reform, Rudy Giuliani is leading the field. Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People is a concrete platform of how he will bring the same change to the country that he brought to New York City, and I'm honored to be a part of his optimistic campaign," Horne said.
"With more than 25 years of experience in public service and Florida politics, Jim is a welcome addition to our campaign in Florida," said Giuliani Florida Chairman and state Attorney General Bill McCollum.
