In-town pool report #5 -- POTUS enters 
The president entered the room at about 8:38 a.m. Those in the crowd clapped and stood as he entered. The president walked up to a long table next to the podium. He picked up a newspaper that displayed a headline "Aquitted" and pointed to it, which prompted laughter from the crowd.

In-town pool report #6 -- more color from room 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who was seated at the end of a long table on the stage around the podium, stood and clapped as President Trump entered the room. She then looked on as he displayed the newspapers declaring him "acquitted" in the Senate impeachment trial.
Pelosi then delivered remarks, which were captured by the livestream.

In-town pool report #7 -- POTUS takes the podium 
President Trump approached the podium at approximately 9:09 a.m.
The president was preceded by keynote speaker Dr. Arthur Brooks. Also, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) each delivered prayers at the beginning of the program, before Dr. Brooks spoke.
A little more color from the president's entrance earlier -- the newspapers that he held up shortly after he entered the room describing his acquittal by the Senate were copies of USA TODAY and the Washington Post. There were also cheers when he held them up. Your pooler did not see Speaker Pelosi's expression or reaction in the moment.

In-town pool report #8 -- POTUS begins remarks 
The president was greeted by standing applause as he stepped to the podium. He began his remarks at 9:10 a.m.
He referred to his impeachment at the outset of his remarks, saying that he and Republicans had been put through a "terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people."
"I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, ‘I pray for you,' when they know that's not so," Trump said.
Speaker Pelosi, who is still seated at one of the long tables next to the podium, appeared to shake her head when the president said the last line. Your pooler could not see her expression.
The president is still speaking.
