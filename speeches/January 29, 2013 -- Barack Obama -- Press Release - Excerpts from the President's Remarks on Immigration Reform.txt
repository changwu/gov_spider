"We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in this country right now.
The good news is that – for the first time in many years – Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together.

At this moment, it looks like there's a genuine desire to get this done soon. And that's very encouraging."
