    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose four rescissions totalling $126.4 million in budget authority provided in the Second Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1976. In addition, I am reporting four new deferrals totalling $334 million in budget authority.
Three of the proposed rescissions are for education programs of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The other rescission proposal affects the child nutrition program of the Department of Agriculture. These funds are either not needed to accomplish program objectives or, in the case of $3 million which would fund State school financing programs, would be used inappropriately to fulfill a State responsibility rather than a Federal responsibility.
Approval of these rescission proposals would (1) reduce Federal spending by $126.4 million over the transition quarter, 1977, and 1978, and (2) provide the Congress with an opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to prevent unnecessary Federal spending even if this involves reconsidering earlier funding decisions.
One of the deferrals consists of $4 million in construction funds for the Rogers Memorial Hospital in the District of Columbia. This deferral is reported to give Congress time to consider a request to reprogram the funds. The reprogramming that I will propose would allow all eligible medical facilities construction projects in the country an equal opportunity to compete for the funds. The other three deferrals are reported because there will be delays in the use of available funds.
