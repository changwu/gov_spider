    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rinaldo (R) New Jersey and 6 others)
The Administration understands that an amendment in the nature of a substitute will be offered for H.R. 3031. The Administration opposes the bill and substitute unless they are amended to vest authority for telecommunications and information functions in the Secretary of Commerce, not an Assistant Secretary. Telecommunications and information responsibilities are now assigned to the Secretary under Executive Order 12046 and under statutes. The Secretary's authorities are delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who heads NTIA. H.R. 3031 should continue to vest the responsibilities in the Secretary, but authorize the continued exercise of such responsibilities by NTIA on behalf of the Department of Commerce.
The Administration also opposes section 5 of the substitute and urges its deletion. It would prohibit the Secretary from reassigning any NTIA function without first reporting to a specified House and Senate Committee and waiting for 90 "legislative days." This provision would seriously undermine the Secretary's ability to effectively manage the Department.
