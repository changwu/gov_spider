    Today, Biden for President announced Joe Biden's guests for the first presidential debate tonight held in Cleveland, Ohio: Kristin Urquiza of San Francisco, California, Gurneé Green of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and James Evanoff Jr. of Cleveland, Ohio.
Kristin Urquiza shared a powerful story at the Democratic National Convention about losing her father to COVID-19 in Arizona, declaring his "only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump — and for that he paid with his life." Urquiza is an environmental advocate at Mighty Earth and co-founded the awareness campaign "Marked by COVID."
Gurneé Green is a small business owner from Cleveland Heights who was highlighted during the Democratic National Convention. He owns the Cleveland Heights fashion boutique Chemistry 11. In addition to being a small business owner, Gurneé is a certified healthcare information technologies analyst and mother of two.
James Evanoff Jr. is a service technician in Cleveland. He has eight years of seniority with United Steel Workers (USW) and works at ArcelorMittal, which was recently acquired by Cleveland Cliffs.
Vice President Biden's debate night guests represent the working families he will fight for as President, and they each highlight how Donald Trump's failures to control the virus and save the economy have hurt hard working Americans lives and livelihoods.
