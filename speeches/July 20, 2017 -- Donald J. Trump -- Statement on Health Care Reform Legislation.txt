    Yesterday, I met with Republican Senators at the White House and told them that now is the time for action. Obamacare was a big lie. "You can keep your doctor"—lie. "You can keep your plan"—lie. Now, people are hurting, and inaction is not an option. We must repeal and replace this disaster. The Senate should not leave for summer recess until it has passed a plan to give our people great healthcare. I'm ready to act; I have pen in hand. I'll sign the legislation into law, and then we can celebrate for the American people.
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
