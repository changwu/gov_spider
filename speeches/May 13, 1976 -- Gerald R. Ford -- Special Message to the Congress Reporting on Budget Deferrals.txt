    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I report two new deferrals. One of the deferrals--in the Department of the Interior--postpones obligation of $688,430 for design of a Bureau of Mines research center. The other deferral sets aside $500,000 to begin accruing an American Revolution Bicentennial Administration scholarship escrow fund.
The details of the deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
