    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As part of our continuing commitment to help strengthen Historically Black Colleges and Universities, a commitment begun when I issued Executive Order 12320 on September 15, 1981, I am hereby directing all Federal agency heads to implement the following three policies as they continue with their efforts to comply with Executive Order 12320:
• Wherever possible, agencies should place emphasis on the use of program funds to help improve the administrative infrastructures of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
• In cases where agencies project decreased funding for all higher education institutions, they should strive to increase the percentage share allocated to Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
• Agencies should continue efforts to eliminate identified barriers to Historically Black Colleges and Universities participation in Federal programs and accelerate activities to single out policies or regulations which inhibit full participation in such programs by Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
Heads of Key Agencies Providing Federal Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (see attached list) shall use these policies in preparing their Annual Performance Reports, which must be submitted to the Secretary of Education after the close of the fiscal year in accordance with Section 3 of Executive Order 12320. The Secretary of Education shall use these policies in developing the Annual Federal Performance Report on Executive Agency Actions to Assist Historically Black Colleges, as required by Section 7 of the Executive Order. Heads of Key Agencies should ensure that these policies are followed in developing all other reports required by the Executive Order.
Additionally, I have directed that the White House Office of Private Sector Initiative work in cooperation with the Department of Education's White House Initiatives staff to place special emphasis on increasing development of private sector support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
Your support for the efforts mandated by Executive Order 12320 is vital. We must all communicate clearly and sincerely through our actions our intention to preserve a measure of security for Historically Black Colleges and Universities while we work together toward developing strength through independence and institutional self-sufficiency.
