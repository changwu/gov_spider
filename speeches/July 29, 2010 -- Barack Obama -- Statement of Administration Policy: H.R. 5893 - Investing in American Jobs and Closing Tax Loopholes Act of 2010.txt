(House)
(Rep. Levin, D-Michigan, and 20 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5893. Passage of this legislation will provide much-needed relief to families, encourage continued job creation by America's businesses, and provide critical assistance to hard-pressed States, including funding to create and support jobs in the private and public sectors. In addition, H.R. 5893 includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President's Budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow companies to inappropriately lower their U.S. taxes. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on these and additional job-creation measures.
