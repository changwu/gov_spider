    (Washington, DC) â€“ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator-designate Scott Pruitt today met with U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (WV-D) on Capitol Hill to discuss Mr. Pruitt's upcoming hearing before the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works committee.
Below is a statement from EPA Administrator-designate Pruitt:
"Senator Joe Manchin and I had a very good and productive meeting today. Senator Manchin has long been a leader in advancing a balanced energy policy that both protects the environment and enables economic growth. We discussed the many ways the EPA can help the people and protect the natural environment of West Virginia and our nation. If confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to working with Senator Manchin and his colleague Senator Capito as we find the right balance that works best for the people and the environment of their very special state."
Below is a statement from Senator Manchin:
"Attorney General Pruitt and I had a very productive conversation today about his plans for the Environmental Protection Agency and ways we can work together. We both come from energy producing states and have a great deal in common. He committed to visiting West Virginia and working with me on some of the clean water challenges that we have experienced in recent years in cities like Vienna, Parkersburg and Charleston. I believe the Attorney General has the right experience for the position and look forward to his confirmation process."
