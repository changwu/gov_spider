"I have always been clear that the person I will support for president must be a true leader — someone who can unite our country and move our nation forward. I believe Marco Rubio is that person. One of the most important jobs of our next president will be keeping this country safe. Senator Rubio has the knowledge and understanding of the serious threats facing this country."
Mullin is a small business owner, rancher, and next generation conservative.
Glad to have Oklahoma's own @RepMullin as part of #TeamMarco https://t.co/c35DMYPpId

Fun fact: Mullin is also a former college wrestler and mixed martial arts fighter.

In 2014, the New York Times reported that Mullin is making use of his athletic experience on Capitol Hill:
A new muscle-crushing, sweat-inducing workout has infiltrated the inner sanctum of Congress, the members-only gym of the House of Representatives. And it is called, simply, the "Markwayne Mullin."
Named after Mr. Mullin, the 36-year-old Republican representative from Oklahoma and former professional mixed martial arts cage fighter who leads the predawn, bespoke workout, it is a "mix of CrossFit and circuit training," he says.
On a recent Thursday, at 6:30 a.m. in a gym in the shadow of the Capitol, a bipartisan group of seven House lawmakers gathered for Mr. Mullin to put them through the paces, as he does almost every morning when Congress is in session. . . .
Representative Mullin, welcome to Team Marco!
