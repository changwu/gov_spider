Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney announced today that Queen Creek Mayor Art Sanders endorsed his candidacy for President of the United States.
"Whether as a businessman or public official, Mayor Sanders has demonstrated a deep commitment to helping his community. He joins our growing Arizona campaign effort that will mobilize our already strong grassroots support," said Governor Romney.
With today's endorsement, Mayor Sanders said, "Governor Romney is a proven leader who makes things happen. He's the innovative leader we need now more than ever in Washington."
Mayor Sanders was elected Mayor of Queen Creek in 2006. He joins Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, State Senator Chuck Gray, State Representative Mark Anderson and State Representative Rich Crandall supporting Governor Romney.
