    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Coverdell (R) GA, Feinstein (D) CA and others)
The Administration supports the bipartisan amendment requiring a Presidential report on U.S.-Mexico counternarcotics efforts. This amendment will facilitate efforts by the United States and Mexico to continue to achieve results in combatting the production of and trafficking in illicit drugs.
On February 28, 1997, the President certified that Mexico, among other countries, has cooperated fully with the United States, or has taken adequate steps on its own in the fight against narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering. The President's decision to certify Mexico's counterdrug efforts was based on an objective review of Mexico's significant accomplishments over the past year. President Zedillo has shown the determination to confront the drug trade head-on and to root out corruption. In 1996, Mexico passed new counternarcotics legislation and enacted regulations to combat organized crime, money laundering, and chemical diversion. The Mexican Government has increased the number of extraditions, improved detection and monitoring of traffickers transiting Mexico, and is improving its police force to make corruption less likely. Drug seizures, arrests, destruction of clandestine labs, and eradication of illegal drug crops increased in 1996 over 1995. The Administration is working closely with Mexico to ensure that this progress continues.
