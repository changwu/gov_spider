    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124, I am pleased to forward the reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on awards made during fiscal year 1971 to members of the Armed Forces for suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.
Participation by military personnel in the cash awards program was authorized by the Congress in September 1965. There could be no better demonstration of the program's success than the fact that tangible first-year benefits in excess of $555 million have been realized from the suggestions of military personnel since the program began.
The tangible first-year benefits resulting from adopted suggestions submitted by Department of Defense and Coast Guard military personnel during fiscal year 1971 totaled $117,676,188, the second highest annual amount in the history of the program. Cash awards presented to military personnel for their adopted suggestions during fiscal year 1971 totaled $1,919, 121.
