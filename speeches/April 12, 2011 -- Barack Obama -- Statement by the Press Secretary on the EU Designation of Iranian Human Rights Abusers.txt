    We welcome the EU's designation of Iranian officials responsible for human rights abuses in Iran. These designations are an important reminder to Iran that the international community will continue to hold accountable those responsible for abuses against the Iranian people. The United States calls on Iran to respect and protect the universal rights of its citizens. We will continue to work closely with the EU and other like-minded partners to ensure that the cause of human rights remains at the forefront of our efforts in support of the Iranian people.
