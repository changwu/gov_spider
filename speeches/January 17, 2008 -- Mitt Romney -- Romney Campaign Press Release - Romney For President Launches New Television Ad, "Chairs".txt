Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Chairs." The ad features Governor Romney addressing the need for change in a Washington that is fundamentally broken. For decades, Washington has promised action on issues like health care reform, reducing the middle class burden and securing our borders. Yet, the American people are still waiting for action. As President, Governor Romney will take Washington apart and put it back together. At this critical time in our nation's history, we cannot afford to send the same people back to Washington just to sit in different chairs.
The ad will begin airing today in Florida. Script and viewing link are below.
Script For "Chairs" (TV :30):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I keep hearing the same thing, that Washington is broken.
"I hear the people say they think we deserve health care for all our citizens, but not government health care and that hasn't been done.
"They say we ought to be able to get a reduction in the burden on the middle class, and that hasn't been done.
"They say we ought to solve the immigration problem in this country. It hasn't been done.
"If you send the same people back to Washington just to sit in different chairs, nothing will happen.
"I will change Washington. I will take it apart and put it back together. I know how to bring change.
"I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message."
