    Regarding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report: "Tobacco Use and Usual Source of Cigarettes Among High School Studentsâ€”United States, 1995:"
Today's report is disturbing proof that more and more young teenagers are becoming lifelong smokers and too little is being done to prevent illegal tobacco sales to them. The significant increase in smoking among young African-American men is of particular concern.
Parents and communities need tough and enforceable measures to combat the easy access and appeal of cigarettes to children. My administration remains committed to preventing adolescent decisions from becoming lifelong addictions. I ask all Americans to support strong measures that will effectively address the growing problem of tobacco use by our children.
