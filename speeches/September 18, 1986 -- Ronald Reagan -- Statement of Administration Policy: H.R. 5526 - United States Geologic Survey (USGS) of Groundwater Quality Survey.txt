    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Gejdenson (D) Connecticut)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5526 because:
— the legislation is unnecessary — USGS already has authority to engage in the activities called for by the bill; in fact, the President's FY 1987 Budget includes increased funds for the National Water Quality Assesssment Pilot Program that was initiated this year; and
— any additional funding, or program expansion, would be premature prior to the completion and review of the pilot program, especially in light of the very pressing need to constrain Federal expenditures.
