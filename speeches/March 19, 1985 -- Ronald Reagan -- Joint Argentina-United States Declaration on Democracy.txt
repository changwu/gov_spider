    Presidents Alfonsin and Reagan expressed their gratification and support for the spread and strengthening of democracy and individual freedom in the western hemisphere. They said the foreign policies of both countries are driven by the goals of peace, democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law. They affirmed that the most just and lasting resolution of the major problems facing nations comes from leadership democratically chosen by the people in periodic free and fair elections, through the actions of independent legislatures and judiciaries and by close cooperation among democratic countries. Victories against poverty are more certain and peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure political and economic freedom. Both presidents confirmed that relations are warmest and cooperation closest with those countries which practice effective democracy with full regard for the fundamental social, political, economic and human rights for each individual. President Alfonsin said Argentina has instituted a new era of stable and strengthened democracy guaranteeing full protection of human rights. President Reagan reiterated that the United States attaches the highest priority to sustaining that democracy in Argentina.
