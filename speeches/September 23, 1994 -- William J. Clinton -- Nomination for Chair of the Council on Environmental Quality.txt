    The White House today announced a plan to reorganize the environmental operations within the Executive Office of the President by merging the White House Office on Environmental Policy (OEP) with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). In a move that will give continued strength to environmental policymaking in the administration, environmental activities will be consolidated under the Chair of the CEQ.
The President will nominate Kathleen A. (Katie) McGinty, currently Director of the Office on Environmental Policy, as Chair of the CEQ.
"I am pleased to nominate Katie as my new chair of the Council on Environmental Quality," the President said. "She has served this administration, the American people, and most of all the environment with skill and dedication. I am confident that Katie will continue to reflect my commitment to the environment in her new, expanded role."
The President continued, "This merger will enable us to advance our environmental agenda sensibly and effectively. Joining these two teams will make it easier to achieve the goals of economic growth and environmental protection."
