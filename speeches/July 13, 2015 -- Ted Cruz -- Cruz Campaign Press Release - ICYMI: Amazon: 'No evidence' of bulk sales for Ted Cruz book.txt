HOUSTON, Texas — Today, POLITICO reported that Amazon confirmed there is no evidence of the allegation by the New York Times that "bulk sales" drove popularity of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's book, A Time for Truth. Excerpts from POLITICO appear below:
"As of yesterday, 'A Time for Truth' was the number 13 bestselling book, and there is no evidence of unusual bulk purchase activity in our sales data," Sarah Gelman, Amazon's director of press relations, said in an email.
"Amazon's findings match those of HarperCollins, the book's publisher, which said Friday that it had 'investigated the sales pattern' for Cruz's book and found 'no evidence of bulk orders or sales through any retailer or organization.' Moments after that announcement, Cruz's campaign issued a press release accusing the Times of lying and calling on the paper to provide evidence of bulk purchasing or else formally apologize.
...
"'A Time For Truth,' which was published on June 30, sold 11,854 copies in its first week — more than 18 of the 20 titles on the Times bestseller list for the week ending July 4, according to Nielsen bookscan. On raw numbers, Cruz's book would have finished at #3 on the Times' influential list of hardcover nonfiction. However, the Times informed HarperCollins last week that Cruz's book would not be on the list.
