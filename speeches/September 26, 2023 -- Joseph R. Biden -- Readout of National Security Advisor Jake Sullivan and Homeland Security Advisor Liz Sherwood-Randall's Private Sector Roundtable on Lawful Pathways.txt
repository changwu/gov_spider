    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall today hosted over 70 representatives from foreign governments, private companies, civil society, and international and community organizations at the White House to discuss how we can work together to further expand lawful pathways and offer an alternative to the smugglers who prey on vulnerable migrants.
National Security Advisor Sullivan and Homeland Security Advisor Sherwood-Randall provided an overview of the progress already made under the new Safe Mobility Office Initiative, which the United States launched with Canada, Spain, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia earlier this year. The SMO Initiative includes both physical locations and a digital portal to process and refer migrants to available legal pathways to the United States and other participating countries. They also discussed ways the administration can continue to partner with the private sector and other organizations to build out the initiative to its full potential.
Today's event is just one of the many ways the Biden-Harris administration is engaging with regional partners, international organizations, and the private sector under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection to respond the historic migration challenge in the Western Hemisphere.
