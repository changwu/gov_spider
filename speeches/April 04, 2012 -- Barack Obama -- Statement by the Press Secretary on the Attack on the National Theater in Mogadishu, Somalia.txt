    The United States strongly condemns the outrageous attack today in Mogadishu that resulted in a tragic loss of life. We offer our condolences to the Somali people, particularly those who lost family and loved ones. Somalia, with the support of African Union peacekeepers, has made great strides in the past months to improve security and rebuild Mogadishu after two decades of civil strife. Al-Shabaab's attack on the newly reopened National Theater is another sign that it is standing in the way of Somalia's path to peace and stability, and demonstrates why it is being rejected by the Somali people. We remain committed to the people of Somalia and assisting them in countering al-Shabaab's violence and in returning peace to their country.
