Tonight, Donnie will be joining special guests Rick Harrison, Sen. Dean Heller, Lt. Gov. Hutchison and Rep. Jason Chaffetz at Marco's rally in North Las Vegas. 
Here's what he had to say about Marco:
Even though we do not see eye to eye on every issue, I know that Marco is a man of principle who can be trusted to keep us safe and give each and every one of us a shot at the American Dream, Marco is a humble man who has not forgotten his roots, and he will fight to make sure that where you come from does not determine how far you can go. We need a leader like Marco to inspire a new Republican party and unite our nation, and I am proud to support him for President.
