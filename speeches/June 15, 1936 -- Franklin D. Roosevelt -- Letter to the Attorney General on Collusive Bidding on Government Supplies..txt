    My dear Mr. Attorney General:
I am sending you herewith the report to the President by the Federal Trade Commission in relation to collusive bidding on steel sheet piling.
You will note that the Federal Trade Commission definitely finds the existence of collusion. In accordance with their recommendation, I am referring the whole matter to you for appropriate action.
Please also note the further recommendations of the Commission:
(a) That the President request all purchasing officials of the Federal Government to collect and furnish evidence regarding instances where there has been collusive or identical bidding.
(b) That the President give consideration to recommending legislation to the Congress to make existing unfair practices unlawful.
Will you be good enough to prepare for me the necessary letters to purchasing agents to be sent out by me at once, and also to prepare a draft of recommendations to the Congress at its next session?
Very sincerely yours,
The Attorney General,
Department of Justice,
Washington, D. C.
