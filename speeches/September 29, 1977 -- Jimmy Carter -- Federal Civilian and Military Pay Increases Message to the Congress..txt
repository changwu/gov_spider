    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 5305 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby report on the comparability adjustment I am ordering for the Federal statutory pay systems in October 1977.
The Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission, who serve jointly as my agent for Federal pay, have proposed a 7.05 percent across-the-board increase in pay rates for the Federal statutory pay systems. The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay has concurred with this recommendation.
While the Federal Employees Pay Council recommended a larger increase, I have decided that the 7.05 percent increase fully satisfies the principles set forth in the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970 that Federal salaries be comparable with those in private enterprise for the same levels of work.
I am transmitting herewith the reports of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Committee, as well as a copy of the Executive order I have promulgated to put this pay adjustment into effect.
