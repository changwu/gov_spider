    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 90-542), I am transmitting to the Congress my recommendations and proposals with respect to the designation of the Tuolumne River in California.
The Tuolumne River has been jointly studied by the Departments of Agriculture and Interior. Of the 92 miles which were studied, 82 miles have been found eligible to be added to the national system of Wild and Scenic Rivers. The study proposes that if added to the national system, the river would be jointly managed by the Departments of Interior and Agriculture.
On the basis of information now available, I concur with the findings of the study and recommend that the mileage found to be eligible to be added to the system should be designated as a Wild and Scenic River as part of the national system. A draft bill to accomplish this is attached.
The final printed version of the study has not yet been prepared. In order to meet the statutory deadline of October 2, 1979, however, I am transmitting this recommendation. I intend that the study of the river be finalized and I shall have it transmitted to you when it is complete. Should any other pertinent information become available however, which would call for a different recommendation, I shall transmit a revised proposal to you along with the completed study.
