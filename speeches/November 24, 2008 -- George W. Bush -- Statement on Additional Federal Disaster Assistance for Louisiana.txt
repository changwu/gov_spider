    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Louisiana affected by Hurricane Gustav during the period of September 1-11, 2008, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public Assistance projects.
The President's major disaster declaration issued for the State on September 2, 2008, and in subsequent amendments authorized Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and the Hazard Mitigation Grant program. Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance under Section 408 were authorized at 75 percent Federal funding of total eligible costs.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share for Public Assistance for this disaster has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs.
The cost-share adjustment is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana.
