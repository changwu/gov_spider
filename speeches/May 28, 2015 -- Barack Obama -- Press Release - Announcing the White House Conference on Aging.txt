    On Monday, July 13, President Obama will host the White House Conference on Aging. The White House has held a Conference on Aging each decade since the 1960s to identify and advance actions to improve the quality of life of older Americans. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act, as well as the 80th anniversary of Social Security. The conference is an opportunity to recognize the importance of these key programs while bringing together older Americans, caregivers, government officials, members of the public, business leaders, and community leaders to discuss the issues that will help shape the landscape for older Americans in the next decade. This year's regional forums in Tampa, FL; Phoenix, AZ; Seattle, WA; Cleveland, OH and today's event in Boston, MA provided opportunities for Americans across the country to engage in policy discussions, submit input on their priorities and share their stories ahead of the White House event. Additional details about the conference will be released at a later date.
