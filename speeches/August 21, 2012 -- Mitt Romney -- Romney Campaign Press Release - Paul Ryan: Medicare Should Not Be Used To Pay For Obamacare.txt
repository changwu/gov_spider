    "Nearly 1 out of 6 hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business, or just stop taking Medicare patients, because you know why? President Obama treated Medicare like a piggy bank to fund Obamacare, and his campaign calls that an 'achievement.'"  –Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "In the meantime, you are going to hear a whole lot of distortions, because that's all the President has left to offer. You hear him talking about Medicare—I heard my buddy, Tim, talking about this. Medicare is important to each and every one of us. Somebody in our family relies on this program, or is about to rely on this program. In Pennsylvania, thirty-eight percent of all seniors in Pennsylvania have chosen Medicare Advantage for their Medicare benefits. It's a plan they got to choose for themselves that they like. About half of them are going to lose it under Obamacare within five years. That's a $3600 cut in benefits for current seniors. Nearly 1 out of 6 hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business, or just stop taking Medicare patients, because you know why? President Obama treated Medicare like a piggy bank to fund Obamacare, and his campaign calls that an 'achievement.' You think that's an achievement? No. Medicare should be there for Medicare, not Obamacare."
