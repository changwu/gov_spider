 In-town pool #1 — Good morning 
?Good morning from the White House, where it is a brisk 50 degrees or so.
The pool has been tested for the coronavirus.
President Trump started his day with a Fox News interview; at 9:45 a.m. he plans to travel to Arlington, Virginia, to thank campaign staffers at HQ. The visit is marked "closed press" right now.
That is the only official item on his schedule but, of course, it is Election Day.
The president is expected to receive the results from the White House. Your pooler has requested more details on guests, set-up for a possible address to the public from East Room, etc., and will let you know once I know.

 in-town pool #12 — Key quotes from HQ event 
?You can find the full campaign HQ event here:https://www.c-span.org/video/?477752-1/president-trump-speaks-reporters-...
Highlighting a few full quotes here:
Have you written an acceptance speech and a concession speech?"I'm not thinking about concession speech or acceptance speech yet. Hopefully, we'll be only doing one of those two. And you know, winning is easy, losing is never easy — not for me, it's not."
pivots to rallies: "There's a tremendous love going on in this country. And there's really a tremendous unity. Nobody's ever seen that, where you take an airport and the airport's not big enough to hold the crowds. Nobody's ever seen a thing like that."
When do you think we'll know a winner and should every vote be counted no matter how long it takes?"Well, I think you'll know possibly tonight, depending possibly on the extent of victory. I think you could know tonight. I think the ruling on Pennsylvania was an unfortunate one by the Supreme Court because I think we should know what happens on the night. Let people put their ballots in earlier," he said."But you have to have numbers, you can't have these things delayed for many days and maybe weeks, you can't do that. The whole world is waiting, this country is waiting but the whole world is waiting. A lot of shenanigans, a lot of bad things happen with ballots when you say, 'Oh, let's devote days and days.' And all of a sudden the ballot count changes and you take a look at Philadelphia, the history of Philadelphia politics. No, I don't put people on their honor code, I don't think it's right."

 In-town pool #14 — Checking in, no guidance on Trump address yet 
Hello,It's been a while since the last report so wanted to check in and say pooler hasn't been given guidance by WH or estimate on timing of a Trump address at this point in result-gathering.
Reporters are milling around the press area watching results and earlier in the day there were a lot of reporters doing live shots in the driveway (besides Pebble Beach), much more than usual.
The White House East Room is set up for a speech with a lectern and screens on either side. A ton of American flags in the center round out the backdrop. There are two blocks of chairs with a center aisle.
You will have seen social media reports about hors d'oeuvres, etc., being served at a WH reception, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed he is there.
