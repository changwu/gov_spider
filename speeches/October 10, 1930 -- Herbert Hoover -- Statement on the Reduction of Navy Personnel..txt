    THERE has been some misconstruction of the Navy's program for reducing personnel to plans effected by the [London Naval] treaty. The men for the Navy are recruited for definite periods, and they have the right, and the Navy would not dream of putting them out of the service until their term of enlistment had expired. Furthermore, under the plan anyone who wishes to reenlist in the Navy will be welcome. The readjustment of about 4,800 in the personnel will be brought about under the plan proposed solely by the wastage--men who die or who wish to quit at the time of the expiration of their enlisted period. So there is no basis for the suggestion that the Navy Department is adding to unemployment by this arrangement.
