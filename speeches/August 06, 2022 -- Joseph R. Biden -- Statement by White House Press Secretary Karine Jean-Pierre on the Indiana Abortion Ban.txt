    The Indiana legislature took a devastating step as a result of the Supreme Court's extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate women's constitutionally-protected right to abortion. And, it's another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women's reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.
Yesterday's vote, which institutes a near-total abortion ban in Indiana, should be a signal to Americans across the country to make their voices heard. Congress should also act immediately to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe â€“ the only way to secure a woman's right to choose nationally.
Until then, President Biden is committed to taking action to protect women's reproductive rights and freedom, and access to care they are afforded under Federal law.
