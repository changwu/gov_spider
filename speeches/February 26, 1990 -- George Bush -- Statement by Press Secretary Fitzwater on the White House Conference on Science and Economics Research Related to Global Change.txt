    President Bush today invited a number of countries, the European Community, and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to send official delegations to a White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change. The Conference will be held in Washington, DC, April 17 - 18, 1990.
The President announced his intention to host this Conference during his meeting with President Gorbachev and again recently in a speech to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The Conference will be devoted to science and economics issues relevant to policy on global environmental issues, including climate change. It is designed to substantially enhance and broaden international understanding of the important science and economics research issues related to global change.
The Conference will also assist in framing a strategy for implementing a joint international understanding of this science and economics research effort, and linking that knowledge to the policy process both nationally and internationally. The administration considers the Conference a vital next step in a joint international approach to address possible changes in the global environment.
Conference participants have been invited to send delegations consisting of their senior scientific, environmental, and economic officials. The President has designated the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Dr. D. Allan Bromley; the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Michael Boskin; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, Mr. Michael R. Deland, to serve as Cochairmen of this Conference.
