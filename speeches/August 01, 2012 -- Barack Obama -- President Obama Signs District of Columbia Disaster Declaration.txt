    The President yesterday declared a major disaster exists in the District of Columbia and ordered Federal aid to supplement the District of Columbia recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms during the period of June 29 to July 1, 2012.
Federal funding is available to the District of Columbia and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms in the District of Columbia.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures in the District of Columbia.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Michael J. Lapinski as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the District of Columbia and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
