    I have approved S. 613, a bill authorizing that a special gold medal be struck in recognition of Hubert Humphrey's distinguished career, and that as President I present it to Mrs. Humphrey on behalf of the Congress.
Hubert Humphrey's unyielding dedication to the principles of equality and social justice will forever remind us that one person can make a difference in the life and well-being of a whole nation. We have a long road to travel before we fully achieve the goals he sought, but few men or women have paved as much of that road as Hubert Humphrey did. Let us dedicate ourselves to finishing his work.
It is an honor and privilege for me as President to join with the Congress in tribute to this great American.
