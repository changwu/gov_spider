    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Roskam, R-IL, and one cosponsor)
The Administration supports H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018. This commonsense package of healthcare reforms would give Americans greater ability and incentive to save for healthcare expenses. It would allow them more control over how to spend their resources to best improve their healthcare and health and it would lower insurance premiums for millions of Americans.
Combined with a qualifying health plan, health savings accounts (HSAs) are proven tools to reduce health care costs by better engaging consumers in their health care decisions. H.R. 6311 would allow more Americans to obtain greater benefit from HSAs, by raising contribution limits, allowing working seniors enrolled in Medicare Part A to contribute to an HSA, and permitting HSAs to be paired with Obamacare bronze and catastrophic plans. This bill would also allow people to roll over a greater amount of Flexible Spending Account contributions, reducing wasteful end-of-year healthcare spending.
Insurance options have dwindled and premiums have soared as a result of Obamacare. H.R. 6311 also would take concrete steps to lower health insurance premiums by providing relief from Obamacare's tax on health insurance plans and increasing access to lower-cost plans. The bill is consistent with this Administration's commitment to give back greater control over healthcare choices to American patients and families.
If H.R. 6311 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
