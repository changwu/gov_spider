    The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California's sixth Congressional District. The Congresswoman cited Senator Clinton's commitment to ending the war in Iraq as the top reason for her backing.
"Hillary Clinton is the candidate with the strength and experience to bring about the change that California families need," said Rep. Woolsey. "I trust Hillary to end the war in Iraq, bring our troops home quickly and safely, and regain our nation's standing around the world."
Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey is serving her eighth term representing all of Marin, and most of Sonoma County.
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congresswoman Woolsey is a vocal and visible leader on progressive issues, particularly those dealing with children and families. A passionate and outspoken opponent of the Iraq war, she has helped move public opinion against President Bush's failed Iraq policy. She introduced the first resolution calling for our troops to be brought home and convened the first congressional hearing on military exit strategies. The San Jose Mercury News recently called her "the unofficial matriarch of the [anti-war] movement in Congress."
A member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman Woolsey believes that ending the Iraq war must be the beginning of a complete re-evaluation of U.S. national security policy.
"I am honored to receive Lynn's support," Clinton said. "She has been a tireless fighter for working families and has led the effort to end the war in Iraq."
Rep. Woolsey joins other California members of Congress supporting Hillary, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Dennis Cardoza (D-18), Rep. Jane Harman (D-36), Rep. Tom Lantos (D-12), Rep. Doris Matsui (D-5), Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-38), Rep. Laura Richardson (D-37), Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-34), Rep. Brad Sherman (D-27), Rep. Hilda Solis (D-32), Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-10) and Rep. Diane Watson (D-33).
