    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Austria, signed at Washington on January 8, 1998.
In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. This Treaty will supersede and significantly improve upon the Treaty between the Government of the United States and the Government of Austria for the extradition of fugitives from justice, signed at Vienna on January 31, 1930, and the Supplementary Extradition Convention signed at Vienna on May 19, 1934.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, June 11, 1998.
