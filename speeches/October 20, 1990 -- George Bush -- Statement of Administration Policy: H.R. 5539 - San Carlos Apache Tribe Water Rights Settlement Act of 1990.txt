    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Udall (D) Arizona and Rhodes (R) Arizona)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 5539. The bill imposes a settlement about which there has been insufficient congressional review and minimal Executive branch involvement. Moreover, the settlement may not resolve the dispute between the San Carlos Apache Indian Tribe, the United States, the State of Arizona, and other parties.
Additionally, some of the parties involved have yet to agree on the issues of water rights and sources, total settlement costs, and the contributions, financial or otherwise, contained in the bill. Furthermore, H.R. 5539 may resolve the water dispute to the disadvantage of other nearby Indian communities. Finally, proponents of H.R. 5539 have not provided justification for the significant Federal funding, estimated at more than $50 million, that would be required by the bill.
