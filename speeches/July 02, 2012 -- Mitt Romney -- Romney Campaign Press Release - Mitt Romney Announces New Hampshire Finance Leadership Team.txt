    Mitt Romney today announced his New Hampshire State Finance leadership team.
"I am proud to announce my New Hampshire State Finance leadership team," said Mitt Romney. "This strong showing of support shows that my message of putting jobs first is resonating with voters from Pittsburg to Nashua. These leaders will help ensure that we have the resources to compete with President Obama's campaign, which will stop at nothing to distract from the President's failed record."
"Throughout the last four years, our country has seen the growth of government and the policies that have hindered our fragile recovery," said New Hampshire Finance State Chair Beverly Bruce. "Granite Staters are looking for a change that will spur economic growth and ensure prosperity for all Americans. Mitt Romney is that candidate and I am proud to stand with him."
