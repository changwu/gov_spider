    I HAVE, of course, been in constant communication with Mr. Dulles during the progress of the London Conference and talked to him again this morning on his return to Washington.
All of us have reasons to be gratified by the outcome of the session. It appears that the agreements reached at the 9-power conference in London will--when ratified--preserve most of the values inherent in the original European Defense Community proposal. Certainly they carry great promise of a strengthened and unified security arrangement among the Western European nations, including West Germany, so as to maintain an effective front in defense of freedom.
Secretary Dulles, in cooperation with the other foreign ministers, has accomplished what may be one of the greatest diplomatic achievements of our time because of the potentialities of these agreements for promoting security, prosperity and peace in Europe, with the inevitable benefits of such a development on the United States and the rest of the world.
