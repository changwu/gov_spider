    Upon arrival in Brussels, Queen Mathilde of Belgium and First Lady Melania Trump listened to a presentation about Child Focus, a center for missing and sexually exploited children founded in Brussels.
"I learned quite a lot while listening to the presentation by the exceptional staff at Child Focus," First Lady Melania Trump said. "It is so important that we talk to children about their online activities, to let them know that computers are useful tools but can be used by people who want to harm them."
After the presentation, the Queen, the First Lady, and their delegations discussed how best to educate children about online behaviors and avoiding online predators.
