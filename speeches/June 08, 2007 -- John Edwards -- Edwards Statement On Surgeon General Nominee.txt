    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about President Bush's nomination of Dr. James Holsinger for Surgeon General.
"In a profession dedicated to healing and compassion, it cannot be hard to find a qualified candidate for Surgeon General who sees all human beings as equals. Instead, President Bush has sought out a nominee who will divide America. Dr. James Holsinger's anti-gay writings and beliefs suggest that he will undermine, not advance, the cause of equality and fairness in health care."
