    The United States strongly condemns Sunday's reported attack on the Cuban embassy in Washington, DC. Attacks against diplomatic facilities are unacceptable. We are in contact with Cuban embassy officials and law enforcement authorities to ensure an appropriate and timely investigation as well as to offer our support for future protective efforts.
