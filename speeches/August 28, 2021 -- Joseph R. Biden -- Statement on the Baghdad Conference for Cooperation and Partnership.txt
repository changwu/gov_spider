    I congratulate the Government of Iraq on hosting a successful and ground-breaking regional summit today. This kind of diplomacy has never been more important as we seek to ease tensions among neighboring states and expand cooperation across the Middle East, and Iraq's leadership on this is historic. I also thank President Macron for his engagement and support for this summit.
The United States continues to stand with our partner Iraq as we work together toward greater stability across the Middle East. We remain committed to strengthening our bilateral relationship under the strategic framework agreement.
When Prime Minister al-Kadhimi and I met in the Oval Office last month, we discussed Iraq's important role in the region and the significant efforts led by the Government of Iraq, including the Kurdistan Regional Government, to improve and strengthen the ties between Iraq and its neighbors.
Diplomacy must be the first tool of our foreign policy, and we are grateful to have partners who share that vision.
