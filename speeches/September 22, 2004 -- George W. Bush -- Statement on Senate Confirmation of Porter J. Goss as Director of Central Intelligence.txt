    I am very pleased that a strong bipartisan majority in the U.S. Senate today voted to confirm Porter Goss as the next Director of Central Intelligence. Porter Goss is a leader with strong experience in intelligence and in the fight against terrorism. He is the right man to take on the essential mission of leading the CIA at this critical moment in our Nation's history as we face the challenges and the dangerous threats of this century. I look forward to his counsel as we implement intelligence reform, including the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.
