    President Bush this morning underwent routine surveillance colonoscopy at Camp David. During the exam, five small polyps were identified and removed. All were less than 1 cm and none appeared worrisome. All were sent for routine microscopic examination to the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda. Results are expected in 48 to 72 hours and will determine the final diagnosis and recommendations for future examinations.
At 7:16 a.m. (EDT), notification was sent advising of the temporary transfer of power of the Presidency to Vice President Dick Cheney in accordance with Section 3 of the 25th Amendment of the Constitution. The procedure was concluded at 7:44 a.m. The power of the Presidency was returned to President Bush at 9:21 a.m.
The President was in good humor and will resume his normal activities at Camp David.
