    Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie issued the following statement on Cory Booker's performance in the fourth Democratic debate:
"Even on this historically crowded stage but, Cory won the night by standing out as a leader, a unifier, and the adult in the room who refocused the conversation on the issues that matter most.
"Cory was a breath of fresh air on the stage, particularly by coming to Vice President Biden's defense against Trump's lies and highlighting issues that aren't getting enough attention in this presidential campaign, like women's reproductive health care, strengthening unions, and ending child poverty.
"For yet another debate, Cory showed a national audience that he can unite our country and make real change for Americans who face injustice and seek opportunity.
"As Cory said, the next president 'is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows.'"
