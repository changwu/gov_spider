    Each year, leading up to Father's Day, our Nation observes Men's Health Week. During this week, I encourage all fathers, brothers, and sons to prioritize their health and well-being by learning more about preventative health practices and steps they can take to live longer, healthier lives.
Even with tremendous recent advances in technology and healthcare, many men still face a broad range of distinctive health issues. The life expectancy for men in the United States is about five years shorter than for women. Many men visit their healthcare providers less frequently than women. One in three American men suffers from a condition related to cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men.
We must ensure that the market for healthcare works for both men and women. Unfortunately, that is not the case today. The current system is failing many Americans, men and women alike, leaving millions with fewer choices for health insurance, skyrocketing premiums, and burdensome out-of-pocket costs. Removing barriers to quality and affordable healthcare is critical to healthcare outcomes throughout our society.
During Men's Health Week, we support expanded education, awareness, and choice in healthcare. Through these reforms, and with focused individual effort, more men will live free of the daily worry too often caused by preventable or treatable pain, illness, and disease.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
