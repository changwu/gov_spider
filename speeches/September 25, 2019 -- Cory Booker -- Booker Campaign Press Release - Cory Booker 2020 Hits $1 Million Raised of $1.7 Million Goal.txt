Newark, NJ â€” As of 10:28 am ET today, Cory 2020 crossed the million dollar mark as it enters the fifth day of a 10-day push to raise $1.7 million to continue to build the infrastructure to continue being competitive in this race.
Four days after alerting supporters in an urgent memo that the campaign needed $1.7 million, Cory 2020 said it had also raised $956,172.08 as of end-of-day Tuesday, crossing the halfway point to $1.7 million goal.
"Although we have crossed the million dollar mark, we know there is still a long road ahead of us," said Cory 2020 campaign manager Addisu Demissie. "The campaign was honest and transparent when we said we needed to raise $1.7 million to continue to build the organization necessary to win, so as great as it feels to be where we are, we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal and to keep growing and investing in our campaign beyond September 30."
