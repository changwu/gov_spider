RECALLING that May 12th is annually observed as National Hospital Day, I take a deep satisfaction in observing the steady growth of the hospitals of the country, not only in physical equipment and financial support but also in the ever-widening fields of service into which they are penetrating. The alleviation of human suffering which they accomplish is a characteristic and noble expression of a spontaneous and universal impulse of the American people, whose warm sympathies and active generosity they so usefully reflect.
