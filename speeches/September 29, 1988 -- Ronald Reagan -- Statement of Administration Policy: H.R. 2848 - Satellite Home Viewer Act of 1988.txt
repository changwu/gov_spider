    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kastenmeier (D) Wisconsin and 27 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2848. Through the device of a compulsory license, the bill would establish royalty fees that satellite broadcast program carriers would pay for copyrighted material. Copyright royalties should, however, be determined in the marketplace though negotiations among carriers, broadcasters, and copyright holders. They should not be set by congressional directive. The compulsory license concept may also hamper the development of cable networks and specialized program formats by broadcasters and reduce the incentive of cable systems to provide their subscribers with more non-broadcast options and viewing choices.
