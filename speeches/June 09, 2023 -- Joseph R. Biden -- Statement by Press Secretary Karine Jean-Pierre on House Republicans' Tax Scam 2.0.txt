    The GOP Tax Scam 2.0 once again makes clear the House Republicans' values: their priority isn't reducing the deficit or out-competing the world, their priority is giving handouts to rich special interests and corporations at the expense of everyone else. Just days ago, House Republicans were demanding devastating cuts to programs hard-working Americans count on—from health care to public safety to Meals on Wheels—in the name of "deficit reduction." Today, they are proposing to spend hundreds of billions on tax breaks for big corporations. That means they are prioritizing restoring tax breaks for big corporations over restoring tax credits that helped cut child poverty in half. And they would deliver those tax giveaways to large profitable corporations, while shipping clean energy jobs overseas and raising energy costs on American families by thousands of dollars a year.
