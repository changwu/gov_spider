    Governor Romney Takes On The Republican Party's Problems "Head On":
The New York Times' David Brooks: "Thank God. Listen, Republicans need to show it's a new Republican Party. George Bush did in 1999. They've been marching to disaster without promising any change, and he's got to fill that in with some substance. But, finally some Republican candidate is going to answer that." (ABC's "This Week," 9/23/07)

Conservative Activist Richard Viguerie: "'At last, a top-tier presidential candidate is paying attention to the discouraged, disheartened and disillusioned base of the Republican Party,' Viguerie said, pointing to a Romney TV ad criticizing the party's 'excessive spending, immigration amnesty and ethical slackness.' Viguerie, a powerful voice in the party's conservative base, said Romney 'has taken a small but significant step toward reclaiming the GOP for the grassroots conservatives who are its backbone.'"

The Politico's Jonathan Martin: "If there was any doubt before now, Mitt Romney made plain today his intent to run as a change agent against a political establishment that he argues is failing the country." (Jonathan Martin, "Romney Makes Strongest Case Yet For Change," The Politico, 9/22/07)
National Review Online's Jim Geraghty: "I think the ad Romney unveiled today is, far and away, his best ad and message yet..." (Jim Geraghty, "I'm A Fan Of Romney's New Message, 'Change Begins With Us'," National Review Online's "The Campaign Spot," http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com, 9/19/07)
- Geraghty: "Kudos to Romney for taking on the GOP's image problems head on. I think an electorate that is tired of finger-pointing, excuses, and evading responsibility will appreciate a candidate who says, 'our side screwed up.'"
