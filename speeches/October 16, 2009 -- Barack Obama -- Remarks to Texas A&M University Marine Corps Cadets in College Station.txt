    I'm not here to give a long speech. I am here to say how proud I am of all the cadets here and all of you who are willing to give back to your country. I'm honored to be joined by one of the greatest public servants we've ever had and somebody who served—World War II and then served on the civilian side and eventually served as Commander in Chief, George H.W. Bush. Everybody please give him a big round of applause.
Assuming some of you continue with your military careers, you may be ultimately reporting to this guy. He had a little something to do with the Aggies a while back. [Laughter] Now he's the Secretary of Defense, and I am so glad to have him here. Please give a big—Bob Gates a big round of applause.
So today was about service. All of you are showing why I feel inspired and I get up every day even when I'm a little pooped, is because I know that there are young people and a next generation that's coming out here and is going to make this country better and is going to protect this country. You guys are symbols of that. And so we are just very appreciative of everything you do. Know that your Commander in Chief draws inspiration from you.
All right, now I'm going to try to shake as many hands as possible.
