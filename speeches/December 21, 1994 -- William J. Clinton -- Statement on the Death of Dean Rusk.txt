    Today we mourn the passing of Dean Rusk, who served our Nation with dignity and with strength as Secretary of State under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Dean Rusk belonged to that great generation of Americans who helped guide our Nation and its allies through the dangerous years of the cold war. The world has changed immeasurably since he served at the side of Presidents, but the principles he helped forge—steadfast American promotion of freedom and opposition to tyranny—are as vital as ever.
Dean Rusk's decency, and his loyalty to the Presidents whom he served and to those who served under him, remains a source of inspiration. When he concluded his 8 years as Secretary of State—the second longest tenure of any American who served in that position— President Johnson awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and he said, "The man who has served me most intelligently, faithfully, and nobly is Dean Rusk."
We will always treasure Dean Rusk's contribution to the United States. And we will honor his memory by always striving to emulate his example.
