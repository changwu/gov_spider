    President Obama and President Piñera enjoyed meaningful and productive meetings during the President's visit to Santiago. They highlighted the strong and natural ties between the United States and Chile and sought to build on their relationship on issues of regional and global importance. In the spirit of enhanced partnership, the two Heads of State agreed to broaden cooperation in several areas. These include:
Strengthening the U.S.-Chile Economic Relationship 
The United States and Chile are strong partners in trade and investment as well as energy, climate change, and environmental cooperation. This relationship is based on a common commitment to an open market economy as the key determinant of economic growth, development, and job creation. Bilateral trade has more than doubled since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force in 2004. During 2011, the United States and Chile will eliminate tariffs on 134 products, further promoting trade between our two countries. We are cooperating on a number of other issues, including active negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 21st century high-standard trade agreement embracing dynamic economies across the Asia Pacific region. In addition, the two Presidents agreed to continue to work together bilaterally and regionally to protect the environment, combat climate change, and enhance clean energy development and deployment.
