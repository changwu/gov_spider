    Today marks the completion of the withdrawal of Russian military forces from the Republic of Estonia and the Latvian Republic, under terms of bilateral agreements concluded between Russia and each of these sovereign states. Russian military forces are also completing their withdrawal today from the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with the agreements reached between Germany and the Soviet Union in October 1990. These withdrawals constitute the final departure of Russian troops that have been present in Eastern Europe since 1945.
This effectively brings to an end a chapter in post-World War II European history, opening the door to a new era of regional stability and cooperation. I congratulate the people of Estonia, Germany, Latvia, and Russia on this historic occasion and salute their leaders for the vision and statesmanship they have demonstrated on behalf of European integration. The United States will continue its active support for this process with the goal of a brighter and more peaceful future for all of our people in the next century.
