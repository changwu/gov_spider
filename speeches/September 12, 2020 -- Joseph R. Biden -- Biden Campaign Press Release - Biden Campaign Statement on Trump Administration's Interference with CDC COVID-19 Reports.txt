    In response to news reported by Politico that Trump's politically-appointed Health Department officials have demanded to alter Centers for Disease Control reports about COVID-19, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"When Donald Trump told Bob Woodward that he wanted to downplay the virus, this is the exact kind of repugnant betrayal that he meant. Instead of telling us the truth about the deadly seriousness of COVID-19, this report is further proof that the Trump Administration has been systematically putting political optics ahead of the safety of the American people.
"Sadly, this is only the latest example of Trump's refusal to be honest about this pandemic — even as the virus has taken nearly 200,000 American lives and has left our economy reeling and our schools shuttered. The middle class families feeling incredible financial strain because of Trump's mismanagement aren't looking for more political spin from the White House — they're looking for real plans and real leadership on this crisis that Trump has shown himself totally unable to provide.
"Vice President Biden has said many times that if we level with the American people about the challenges we face, we can get through them together. But every step of the way, Donald Trump has concealed the truth for his perceived political benefit, in historic acts of malpractice — while failing to come to grips with the severity of this pandemic or the economic carnage it is creating, and refusing to be honest about what needs to be done to win this battle. Trump's failure has left us with six million infected, millions more unemployed, and the worst outbreak in the developed world. We deserve so much better."
