    Today, on the third anniversary of Hurricane Maria, Biden for President announced a new bilingual ad playing homage to the survivors of Hurricane Maria, and the strength of the people of Puerto Rico.
"Prohibido Olvidar," meaning Forgetting is Forbidden, is a digital ad airing in Florida and Pennsylvania in both English and Spanish that features a heartfelt narration and original music by Marc Anthony. The ad is a remembrance of the struggles and difficulties the people of Puerto Rico faced after Hurricane Maria â€”homes were damaged, lives were lost, and roads were swept away. The ad further focuses on Puerto Rico's strength in unity. When Trump's failed response to Hurricane Maria left Puerto Rico to fend for itself, neighbors stepped up to take care of one another and help put the island back together. Marc Anthony implores its audience to remember the power to build a better future is in their hands.
As part of Biden for President's ongoing paid media program, it spent $65 million last week across broadcast and digital. The campaign's ads remain active in a total of ten states, including Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
