    MR. EDISON was as great in his brave fight for life as he was in the achievements which have made the whole world his debtor. I mourn his passing not only as one of the greatest men our nation has produced but as a personal friend. On behalf of the nation I express the profound sympathy of all our people and Mrs. Hoover and I personally extend our deepest sympathy to you and your son and daughter in your irreparable loss.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Thomas A. Edison, Llewellyn Park, West Orange, N.J.]
