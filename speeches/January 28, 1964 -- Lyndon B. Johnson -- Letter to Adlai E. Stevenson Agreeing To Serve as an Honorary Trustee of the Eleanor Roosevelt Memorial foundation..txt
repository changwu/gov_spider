Dear Governor:
Both Mrs. Johnson and I are delighted to accept your invitation to serve as Honorary Trustees of the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial foundation. for more than thirty years, Eleanor Roosevelt was an inspiration to us, as she was to people all over the world. As President Kennedy said just one month before his tragic death, Eleanor Roosevelt "was a remarkable woman who enjoyed the affection and admiration of the entire world."
I want this foundation to succeed. To keep alive the inspiration of her life and work is the best possible memorial to her memory and a national service. I am particularly pleased that the major emphasis of the foundation will be in the vast field of human rights, for this is the necessary touchstone of universal brotherhood.
In completing the task of building the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial foundation, the people of this Nation can now pay tribute both to this gallant woman and to the late President who wanted so much to see this foundation succeed.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson, Chairman, Board of Trustees, Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial foundation, Empire State Building, New York 1, N.Y.]
