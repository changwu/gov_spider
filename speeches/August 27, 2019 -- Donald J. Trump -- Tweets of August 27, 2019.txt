Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7 only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous never happened!Retweets: 30244Favorites: 140341

Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic Giuseppi Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly & works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!Retweets: 2482Favorites: 10793

I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!Retweets: 25461Favorites: 121690

No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7 spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!Retweets: 16377Favorites: 68498

The G-7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France - FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!Retweets: 14882Favorites: 68656

The Federal Reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world. Has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old USA? Our Fed has been calling it wrong for too long!Retweets: 19832Favorites: 75325

Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities and won't protect your Second Amendment! https://t.co/nSX2yuXAb1Retweets: 11374Favorites: 42101

The G7 in France was so successful and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!Retweets: 17914Favorites: 77084

They do stories so big on Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren's crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all. Fake News!Retweets: 16665Favorites: 76189
