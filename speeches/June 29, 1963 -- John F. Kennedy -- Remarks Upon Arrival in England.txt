    Prime Minister:
I am delighted to have this opportunity to meet with you again. I believe this is our seventh meeting we have had in various parts of the world. But though the geography has changed on different occasions, the subjects that we have dealt with have been very much the same; that is, how we can organize our life here in the West, our relations between our countries and those associated with us, so that our people will find themselves living in a more fruitful and productive world, and also in a world of peace and freedom. That was, of course, the challenge which you and my predecessor discussed together in the fifties, and which we now discuss in the sixties.
I am particularly glad on this occasion that we will have an opportunity to talk about the forthcoming trip of our representatives to the Soviet Union. If we could ever bring some degree of control over nuclear matters to the world, I think we would decide that not only had all our other meetings been most useful, but all the efforts that have been made in both of our countries for so many years for peace and for order, and for sense of security--all this effort would be more than justified.
And I am particularly glad, also, Prime Minister, to have an opportunity to visit you in your home. I am very glad to be back in England again.
Thank you.
