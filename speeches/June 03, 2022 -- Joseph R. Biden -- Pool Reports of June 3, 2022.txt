Out of Town Pool Report #4 - Remarks Conclude
The president began speaking at 10:48 AM and concluded at 11:08 AM
He spoke from a podium with the presidential seal, before two flags and a blue backdrop.
At 11:11 AM we are rolling.
He took some questions which I believe all came over on the feed. Some quotes below. Check against transcript.
On Elon Musk's comments on the economy he said other companies are investing. "Lots of luck on the trip to the moon."
On a visit to Saudi Arabia:
"I'm not sure whether I am going. I have no direct plans at the moment. But let me tell you that I have been engaged in trying to work with how we can bring more stability and peace to the Middle East."
Is the Kingdom a pariah: " I'm not going to change my view." But said as president his job was to bring peace.
Would he meet with MBS: "We're getting way ahead of ourselves."
Would he meet with the Hill next week on Guns: "My staff has been dealing constantly."
I'll do what I can to try to see if we have some good progress
