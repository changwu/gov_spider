HOUSTON, Texas â€“ U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today received the endorsements of Texas Congressmen John Culberson (TX-7), Louie Gohmert (TX-1), Michael Burgess (TX-26), and John Ratcliffe (TX-4) in his bid for President, citing his willingness to take on Washington unwavering conservative values.
"We need someone in the White House who will respect the rule of law and the Constitution. There is no one more dedicated to restoring constitutional principles and protecting our individual liberties than Ted Cruz," said Rep. Culberson.
"Ted Cruz has been a steadfast patriot in the fight to ensure that America's best days will still be ahead of us," said Rep. Gohmert. "As he led the battle against ObamaCare, while fighting for the right and ability to choose our own best healthcare, Ted demonstrated principled leadership. He is also more interested in the opinions of those he serves than of some focus group. In Ted we will have a President who is dedicated to achieving equal opportunity for every single American, not just those who support him. With a Ted Cruz Presidency, America will finally be respected around the world again as other nations will see a courageous and intellectual leader, NEVER wavering on principle, who stands by our allies leaving other countries afraid to be our enemy."
Rep. Burgess added, "From Day One, I've known Ted to say what he means and do what he says. He's proven that in the Senate and has remained steadfast to his strong conservative principles. Standing up to the political elites and the special interests is hard enough, but when you're one of only a handful, that not only shows leadership but great character."
"As a full-spectrum conservative, Ted can bring together Republicans of all stripes. He excites all corners of our movement and will unite the Reagan coalition that represents a majority of the country. After eight years of Obama, it is critical we win in November, and Ted Cruz is the leader to pull that majority together," said Rep. Ratcliffe.
