    Today, the County Executives of America, a national bipartisan coalition of more than 700 elected officials who serve as their county's chief elected executive, urged the Senate to move forward with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which the board calls call a "historic and hugely important measure."
CEA President Dan McCoy (Albany County NY Executive) said in a statement, "Our county leaders are eager to move forward with local infrastructure projects that will be made possible with funding from this critical legislation. This once in a generation commitment will grow the economy sustainably while combating the climate crisis, enhance our competitiveness both locally and as a nation and create over 2 million jobs per year over the next decade."
CEA Executive Director Michael Griffin said, "CEA is a bipartisan coalition of county leaders who continually work to find common ground so we especially appreciate the bipartisan nature of this Infrastructure deal. We applaud the Senate negotiating teams on both sides of the aisle as well as President Biden and his Administration for their commitment to delivering results for the working families of this nation."
The Executives join a broad coalition of national and local leaders, community groups, labor organizations, as well as large majorities of Republicans and Democratic voters, to voice support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
