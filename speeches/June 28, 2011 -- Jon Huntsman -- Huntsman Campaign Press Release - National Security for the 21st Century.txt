    As the only candidate with hands-on foreign policy experience, Jon is uniquely qualified to confront and defeat America's enemies abroad - which is especially important in such a tumultuous time in the world.
He understands the War on Terror is unlike any war this nation has previously fought. It is an asymmetrical war, which requires stronger counterintelligence capabilities and nimble special forces - so we can respond quickly wherever threats arise. 

President Reagan knew how to project our strength and defeat our enemy -- not by wasting valuable resources nation-building in central Asia -- but through strength at home and strategic involvement abroad.
Jon believes we have a generational opportunity to clean up the map when it comes to defining our friends and allies and our military deployments. As he's said, we're in many parts of the world that don't make sense for our national security or our budget. He would also work to open more foreign markets for American businesses. In this economy, we should be aggressively pursuing more and greater free trade, not reverting to protectionism or waiting for sign-off from the unions. It's because of Jon's time abroad in various foreign service and diplomatic posts that he understands a nation's foreign policy can only be as strong as a nation's economic core. That's why he's so passionate about changing America's course and revitalizing the economy.
