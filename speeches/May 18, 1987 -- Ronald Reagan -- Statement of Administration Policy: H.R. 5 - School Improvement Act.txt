    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Hawkins (D) California and 51 others)
H.R. 5, which reauthorizes and amends the Department of Education's elementary and secondary education programs, is consistent with the administration's proposals in a number of respects. The bill, however, does not adopt some significant recommendations made by the administration, and contains a number of objectionable features.
Accordingly, the administration would not oppose House passage of H.R. 5 if it were amended to:

(1) incorporate the administration's proposed amendments to Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation Improvement Act that would (a) change the distribution formula to improve targeting among school districts and (b) expand alternatives in the area of choice, such as compensatory education certificates, to promote equitability and effectiveness;
(2) provide more flexibility in local program choice under the Bilingual Education program, by increasing the availability of special alternative instructional programs;
(3) delete provisions that would make audit appeals more costly and burdensome to all parties, and jeopardize the Education Department's ability to maintain accountability;
(4) remove provisions that would unnecessarily interfere with the Interior Department's ability to carry out its responsibilities to educate Indian youth effectively and efficiently; and
(5) eliminate new, unnecessary or duplicative program authorities.
