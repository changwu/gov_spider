    Washington, DC â€“ Vice President Joe Biden issued the following statement today:
"We welcome and support the continued contributions of George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn and William Perry to our nation's security. For decades, the leadership of these eminent statesmen has enhanced our nation's liberty and prosperity, and their enduring commitment serves as an inspiration for our pursuit of the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. The greatest threat facing the American people today is the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states and to terrorists, and we will spare no effort in protecting the American people from this danger.
"Our country is always strongest when supported by bipartisanship. This consensus sustained us during the Cold War and again after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. These four statesmen have shown us the path to improved security by urging us to do all we can to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, while maintaining a safe, secure and effective nuclear arsenal. Their vision has inspired our efforts and we will continue to be guided by their contributions. As we pursue the vision President Obama laid out in Prague last April, release our new budget in February and the Nuclear Posture Review in March, and work toward our Nuclear Security Summit in April, people will see the consensus we have sought translated into action. I encourage members from both parties to embrace these policies, and to heed the wisdom these four esteemed statesmen have demonstrated time and again."
