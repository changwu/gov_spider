    Today, South Carolina State Senator Gerald Malloy, who represents the state's 29th Senate district, which includes Chesterfield, Darlington, Lee, and Marlboro Counties, released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I was proud to support Senator Biden's run for President in 2008, I was proud to lead the effort to draft Vice President Biden in 2016, and I am proud to support him in this race, the most important election of our lifetimes. Joe Biden's history with the state is far deeper than politics or campaigns. This primary is an opportunity to make our mark on this process and catapult the Vice President out of the Palmetto State and into the Democratic nomination â€” and the White House. It is my pleasure to join my friend, Congressman Clyburn, in endorsing Joe Biden."
Senator Malloy's endorsement follows the momentous announcement of House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's support of Vice President Biden bringing the campaign's Palmetto State endorsements to more than 190, including the state's last two Democratic governors, Jim Hodges and Richard "Dick" Riley; state lawmakers, mayors, community activists, pastors and faith leaders, and local elected officials. Biden's diverse and broad coalition also consists of nearly 200 members of Educators for Biden and more than 100 members of Women for Biden from every region of the state.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
