Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama. This time it will be for Six Years not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore and unlike many other Republican leaders wanted him to win. But he didn't and probably won't.....Retweets: 21347Favorites: 96763

...If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020 many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost including our Pro-Life victories. Roy Moore cannot win and the consequences will be devastating....Judges and Supreme Court Justices!Retweets: 20312Favorites: 89554

Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore in our Country a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.Retweets: 38238Favorites: 161246
