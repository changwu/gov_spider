POTUS told the pool he ordered chicken quesadillas and then answered a few questions.
On rising gas prices: "Nationwide, they came down about $1.35 and they're still down over a dollar but we're going to work on housing … That's the most important thing we have to do.
What's your message to Saudi Arabia: "We're about to talk to you."

Travel Pool Report #15: Fundraiser
POTUS entered a tent in the backyard at 7:53 p.m. alongside Speaker Pelosi.
Pelosi spoke first, thanking Marcia Carsey, the host, and praising Biden's leadership and legislative record.
"This president came into office with a vision about greatness for our country," she said.
She concluded: "This is a great president."
POTUS began speaking at 8:02.
He opened by thanking Pelosi and joking he was "going home" after she completed her remarks. He then called Pelosi "the single best speaker in American history."
POTUS launched into a familiar refrain about America facing "an inflection point" and the importance of American leadership on the global stage. He then discussed the technological changes fracturing society and lamenting the difficulty of discerning the truth.
"There are no editors anymore," he said. "The ability of newspapers to have much impact is de minimis."
On Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, POTUS said his staff has calculated he has spent more than 225 hours directly in contact with the heads of state of NATO and EU "just holding [the coalition] together." He then asked if anyone would have thought a Russian leader since the Cuban Missile Crisis would threaten to use tactical nuclear weapons.
When discussing other global threats, Biden called Pakistan one of the most dangerous nations in the world, saying it had "nuclear weapons without any cohesion."
Touted his legislative record, he said, "It's fair to say that we've gotten more done in the past two years than any president in the past has."
In discussing the gun safety bill he signed, Biden said: "Look what happened today in two different places with AK-47s. They're weapons of war. They have no place in society."
Biden also criticized Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and the policies they have advocated, warning that "the right to choose, the right to privacy … and our very democracy" were on the ballot in November.
He said he would veto any bill that tried to implement a national abortion ban.
POTUS also praised the work of the Jan. 6 committee, in particular Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) even though he said they "agree on virtually nothing of substance."
"I think we're going to see some real change as a consequence of the work of the committee," he said.
Biden concluded by expressing his optimism about the country's future and asking attendees to support Democrats in November: w"Please, please, please keep a Democratic House of Representatives."
POTUS concluded his remarks at 8:30 p.m. and pool was ushered out.
Motorcade started rolling at 8:39
Some color of the event (with gratitude to co-pooler Eli Stokols for his assistance):
The fundraiser took place beneath a large white tent in an outdoor area behind the home's garage. More than 100 guests sat in rows of chairs facing a podium before a backdrop of greenery. Others lingered along the sides, including DCC Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney. A bar was set up in the back of the tent; small vases of zinnias sat on scattered cocktail tables. Paul Pelosi, Bill Nye and members of Congress were spotted mingling before Biden Pelosi appeared.
