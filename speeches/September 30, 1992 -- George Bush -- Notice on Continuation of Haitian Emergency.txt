    On October 4, 1991, by Executive Order No. 12775, I declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the grave events that had occurred in the Republic of Haiti to disrupt the legitimate exercise of power by the democratically elected government of that country. On October 28, 1991, by Executive Order No. 12779, I took additional measures by prohibiting, with certain exceptions, trade between the United States and Haiti. Because the assault on Haiti's democracy represented by the military's forced exile of President Aristide continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Haiti in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)).
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
