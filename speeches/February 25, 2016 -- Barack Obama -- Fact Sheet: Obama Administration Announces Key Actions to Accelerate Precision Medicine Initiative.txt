    "Doctors have always recognized that every patient is unique, and doctors have always tried to tailor their treatments as best they can to individuals. You can match a blood transfusion to a blood type — that was an important discovery. What if matching a cancer cure to our genetic code was just as easy, just as standard? What if figuring out the right dose of medicine was as simple as taking our temperature?"—President Obama, January 30, 2015
A year ago the President announced the launch of the Precision Medicine Initiative to accelerate a new era of medicine that delivers the right treatment at the right time to the right person, taking into account individuals' health history, genes, environments, and lifestyles.
Precision medicine is already transforming the way diseases like cancer and mental health conditions are treated. Molecular testing for cancer patients lets physicians and patients select treatments that improve chances of survival and reduce adverse effects. Genetic and other information can help identify the best depression drug for each patient and speed effective treatment, a critical advancement as patients often do not respond to the first drug they are prescribed. But more is needed. There are still far too many diseases for which there are no good treatments. Prevention approaches are not yet tailored to individuals' lifestyles, genes, environment and preferences.
On December 18, 2015, the President signed bipartisan legislation providing more than $200 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative. Today, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is making the first awards under this initiative to begin to build a national, large-scale research participant group. This will be a participant-engaged, data-driven research effort at the intersection of human biology, behavior, genetics, environment, data science, and computation aimed at developing more effective ways to improve health and treat disease. NIH, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration, also will collaborate with community health centers to expand the reach of the Precision Medicine Initiative in underserved communities.
The Precision Medicine Initiative also includes ongoing efforts through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which has enrolled over 450,000 Veterans in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a participant-driven research cohort. The Department of Defense (DOD) is partnering with the VA to expand the MVP and open it up to active duty men and women who wish to participate. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT and the Office for Civil Rights—each a component of the Department of Health and Human Services—are also making key announcements today that will build out research and data capacity, technical tools, and policies to accelerate precision medicine. Finally, the National Cancer Institute will focus key efforts over the next year—in line with the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot —to increase our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cancer and deliver more effective prevention and treatment options to cancer patients, faster.
In conjunction with today's announcements, more than 40 private-sector organizations are making commitments that will accelerate precision medicine, in alignment with the key principles of the Precision Medicine Initiative, which are to:
•      Make it easier for patients to access, understand, and share their own digital health data, including donating it for research;
•      Engage participants as partners in research, including returning results to them in dynamic, user-centered ways;
•      Bring the promise of precision medicine to everyone;
•      Open up data and technology tools to invite citizen participation, unleash new discoveries, and bring together diverse collaborators to share their unique skills;
•      Adhere to strong privacy and data security principles; and
•      Advance and scale precision medicine approaches in clinical practice.

•      The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights today issued additional guidance on individuals' rights to access their health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This new resource addresses the right of an individual to have copies of their health information sent to anyone they designate, including to contribute it for research, and clarifies when and to what extent fees can be charged for access. The guidance includes examples to help HIPAA-covered entities better understand and comply with the law.
Broad Response to the President's Call to Action
Make it easier for patients to access, understand, and share their own digital health data, including donating it for research
•      The Advisory Board Company will build and make available a standardized application programming interface (API) for up to 5 pilot healthcare provider organizations in 2016, allowing them to build fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) applications for patients and providers with their own developers or outside vendors. This commitment to rapidly enhance access to data using open, standardized APIs will help move the market by addressing new use cases and demonstrating success in the use of standardized APIs that can support patient access and data donation for research. Pilot results will be publicly available to help other providers deploy FHIR-driven tools.
•      Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, drchrono, Epic and Mckesson, in 2016 will pilot use of open, standardized APIs and other methods to give individuals the ability to contribute their data to research, including for the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort, when it is launched. These "Sync for Science" pilots will demonstrate a new model of patient-enabled research, leveraging industry-led progress to give patients' access to their own electronic health records through APIs, and breaking down the research data silos that too often slow scientific progress.
•      The American Medical Association (AMA) commits to actively working in 2016 to improve patient access to their medical information and helping physicians leverage electronic tools to make health information more readily available, developing and disseminating a range of resources including toolkits, podcasts, and fact sheets. The AMA will also improve awareness of the Precision Medicine Initiative among physicians, including: creating articles in AMA digital publications; educational sessions at AMA meetings; emails/posts/tweets through social media channels; and information about the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort and how to volunteer, once enrollment begins.
•      Carolinas HealthCare System commits to allowing patients to share aggregated clinical and mobile data with researchers, using a new mobile application that allows patients to view their individualized data from multiple sources through dynamic visualizations, see how well they are managing their health and achieving their health goals, and put their own information into clinical context. The app accesses health and fitness data from more than 70 devices and electronic health records using standardized APIs. Patients who are managing complex diseases can share this data with their care providers and researchers in real time, helping them partner more effectively with clinicians to manage health and healthcare.
•      The Chesapeake Regional Information Service for our Patients (CRISP), a non-profit health information exchange, announces it will provide consumers consent options so they can determine when and how their health information will be available through the health information exchange, including making clinical "data donations" to support research initiatives. CRISP enables the secure exchange of clinical data (lab results, radiology reports and clinical documents) to support treatment and care coordination throughout Maryland and the District of Columbia. Once consumers have authorized data donations, CRISP can enable future information to be automatically routed to selected research initiatives for as long an individual chooses.
•      The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) and OpenNotes announce a partnership to accelerate information sharing between patients and providers. Through the partnership, CHIME—an executive organization serving chief information officers and other senior healthcare IT leaders—will work to raise awareness of OpenNotes and other patient-facing technologies to its membership of more than 1,800. OpenNotes is an initiative that urges health systems and clinicians to offer patients easy and secure access to the medical notes that are part of the electronic health record. While the use of electronic records has flourished, clinical notes are rarely visible to patients. Improving patient access to this information will help spur patient engagement and can be a vital part of advancing more personalized care as envisioned by President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative. Currently, roughly 5 million patients have access to clinical notes thanks to OpenNotes. Through this collaboration, CHIME aims to help OpenNotes reach its goal of expanding to 50 million patients in 3 years.

In the next 2 months, the MMRF will release a white paper and launch a national education campaign—including on-line, print and in-person educational programs—to educate tens of thousands of patients and their families on the critical steps in the patient journey and the actions they can take to maximize their precision care from diagnosis through the course of their disease. The campaign will be informed by findings from an in-depth quantitative survey of the patient journey conducted in 2015 and will leverage the MMRF patient support call center and the MMRF CoMMunity Gateway, an on-line patient community designed to collect and share patient data to drive precision medicine approaches.
•      St. Elizabeth Healthcare will assess and operationalize the use of a precision medicine pharmacogenomics test in 2016 to identify the specific type and dosage of medicine to prescribe based on the patient's genetic profile. St. Elizabeth will publish its key learnings and best practices in open access journals, present findings in public forums, and share ongoing experiences via digital and social media targeting clinicians, patients, and families to increase the awareness and adoption of precision medicine practices. St. Elizabeth will also collaborate with Viable Synergy to provide a Precision Medicine Innovation Station, where patients and families will be able to access educational resources, identify clinicians who offer precision medicine testing, receive direct access to their pharmacogenomics test results, sign-up for supporting services like genetic counselors and medication financial assistance programs, and join peer support communities.
•      Stanford Medicine commits to launching a consultative pharmacogenetics practice in 2016 so that physicians can refer patients with unusual drug responses or with a family history of unusual responses. The new pharmacogenetics practice will analyze patients' genomes in order to determine if there are underlying genetic causes that might enable prescribing physicians to steer clear of problematic drugs and choose others with the best chance of working and having minimum side effects. This targeted pharmacogenetics practice is one example of how precision medicine is changing the care patients receive. As part of their commitment to furthering the understanding of the patterns of genetic variation and how they relate to disease, Stanford University is making the sequence data of 77 Iranian-Americans available publically, with their permission, and will analyze the data and create a reference genome for Iranian-descent people. Stanford makes this data openly available in the hopes of spurring similar studies on other populations.
•      University of Arizona Health Sciences (UAHS) commits to translating large-scale clinical and genomic data into actionable individual patient outcomes through the Centers for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics and Applied Genetics and Genomic Medicine. Effective precision medicine requires clinicians to understand the mechanisms that have gone awry during the course of disease progression. In 2016, UAHS will commit $22 million to expand the clinical utility of its open-source, patient-centric analytic methods to aid physicians in interpreting the dynamic disease-associated gene expression changes arising from patients' own DNA blueprint. UAHS is also launching three new precision medicine initiatives. The first is the system-wide dissemination of an on-demand "case-based reasoning" system that intelligently searches and analyzes entire databases of electronic medical records. This will give clinicians the power to develop an individualized and effective treatment plan for unusual or complex clinical conditions, grounded on practice-based evidence. The second is development of genetic assays to predict an individual's response to therapy and prevention of adverse reactions, termed "pharmacogenomics." Last will be a partnership with five other institutions to advance the Sanford Pediatric Genomics Consortium to help families and their providers improve health care decision-making through better understanding and integration of genomic evidence.
