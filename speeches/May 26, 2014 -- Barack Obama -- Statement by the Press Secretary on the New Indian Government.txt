    President Obama congratulates Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and the new Indian government on their swearing-in today. As the President and Prime Minister agreed in their call after the election, as the world's two largest democracies, India and the United States share a deep bond and commitment to promoting economic opportunity, freedom, and security for our people and around the world.
