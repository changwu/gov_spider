  A Proclamation

Congress has terminated the Petroleum Import Adjustment Program (PIAP), which was designed to reduce the threat to our nation's security caused by our dependence on imported oil. Consistent with this Congressional action, I am rescinding Proclamation 4744 which established the PIAP.
The threat to national security, however, has not dissipated, and an effective means of reducing oil imports remains an imperative. I will work with Congress to reach this objective. In the meantime, the Mandatory Oil Import Program, which the PIAP had modified, will once again govern all importation of oil into this country. The small import fees associated with that Program were first imposed in 1973 and have been suspended since April 6, 1979. Under present circumstances, these fees would not fulfill the long term purposes for which they were originally adopted. I have therefore determined that a further six month suspension of these fees is consistent with the development of a more comprehensive program for reducing oil imports.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.G. 1862), do hereby proclaim that:
SECTION 1?101. Proclamation 4744, as amended, is rescinded in its entirety, effective March 15, 1980.
SEC. 1-102. Proclamation 3279, as amended, is further amended in section 3(a) (1)(i) by deleting both the term "through June 30, 1979." and the clause following that term, and by substituting therefor: "through December 31, 1980 ;".
SEC. 1-103. Proclamation 3279, as amended, is further amended in section 3(a) (1)(ii) by deleting both the term "through June 30, 1979." and the clause following that term, and by substituting therefor: "through December 31, 1980 ;".
SEC. 1-104. Proclamation 3279, as amended, is further amended by deleting section 3(a)(1)(viii).
SEC. 1-105. (a) Proclamation 4762 is revoked.
(b) Section 1 of Proclamation 3279, as amended, is amended by adding a new subsection (f), to read as follows: "Except with respect to licenses issued pursuant to the next to last sentence of Section 4(b) (1) of this Proclamation, all licenses issued pursuant to this Proclamation which could be utilized to enter crude oil or gasoline pursuant to another Proclamation shall expire effective 12:01 a.m., April 24, 1980. Licenses issued for the entry of crude oil and gasoline pursuant to Proclamation 4744, as amended, shall be considered to have been and to be issued pursuant to the authority contained in this Proclamation and shall be subject to all of its terms and conditions (except for those in the preceding sentence), including those arising by virtue of the implementing regulations and interpretations.".
SEC. 1-106. Section 8 of Proclamation 3279, as amended, is amended by deleting the period at the end of the next to last paragraph and by adding at the end of that paragraph the following words: "; provided, that the system of issuing allocation and licenses with respect to exchanges under Section 4(b)(1) of this Proclamation shall remain in effect during any period in which a fee of $0.00, as provided in Section 3 of this Proclamation, is in effect.".
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
