    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Leahy (D) Vermont and 19 others)
The administration has no objection to the commodity distribution provisions in S. 305, but is concerned that an amendment in the bill to the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) would have the effect of limiting the number of participants in the WIC program by allowing additional funds to be used for administrative costs instead of purchasing additional food.
