    "President Obama's coming through Ohio today on a tour that's been dubbed 'Betting on America.' Well, we should all bet on the country but we shouldn't double down on Barack Obama. He's had his chance. It's not working. And we need to get it moving in a different direction." â€” Gov. Tim Pawlenty

GOV. TIM PAWLENTY: "Each state's a little different with a different economy and background and culture but as a general rule if you look at the Midwest you've got people who have a strong work ethic, have a strong sense of community and family and faith and so many other things. But one of the main passports of whether they are going to have access to a quality of life is whether they have a job. And even if they have a job they want it to be a good paying job and they want it to be around. In order for that to happen you got to have a private sector that's investing and growing and providing jobs and prospering. That's not what's happening in the country. And I know Ohio is struggling in many quarters as well. So we need to have some policies that are going to ignite the private sector. Mitt Romney has obviously spent his entire adult life focused on getting jobs growing and that's what he will do as president. President Obama's coming through Ohio today on a tour that's been dubbed 'Betting on America.' Well, we should all bet on the country but we shouldn't double down on Barack Obama. He's had his chance. It's not working. And we need to get it moving in a different direction."
