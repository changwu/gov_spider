    Nancy joins me in sending our warmest greetings to all those celebrating one of the most joyous times in the Jewish calendar, Hanukkahâ€”The Festival of Lights.
This holiday commemorates the Maccabees victory over their oppressors and the valiant spirit of their battle. Two thousand years ago, God blessed their efforts to retain an independent Jewish commonwealth and to preserve the Jewish religion. Today, their descendants have been similarly blessed. Truly, Hanukkah is a festival whose celebration is meaningful in a contemporary as well as an historical context.
The candles of the Menorah attest to the victory of freedom and righteousness. May their light be a source of strength and inspiration to all of you and to all mankind.
