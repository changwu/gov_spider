    Rick McKay had a knack for telling a good story. As a veteran photojournalist who became a trusted member of my team as White House Photo Editor, Rick dedicated his life to sharing the American story through images: moments both expected and unlikely, snapshots both of epic events and everyday kindnesses.
Last night we lost Rick to cancer. Michelle and I send our most sincere condolences to Rick's wife Carol and his children Nick and Ally. Our hearts are heavy at the White House today. But Rick's other family—his White House family—will tell our own stories, memories of Rick's kindness and humor, his passion for NASCAR, his love for his dog Kiley, and his dedication to doing the job the right way. We thank Rick for sharing his joy and optimism through the photos that will live on through history, the stories that will live on in our hearts, and most of all, for making his time here count.
