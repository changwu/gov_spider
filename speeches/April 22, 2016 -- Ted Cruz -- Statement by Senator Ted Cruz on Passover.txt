    HOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement in observance of Passover:
"Today, our Jewish brothers and sisters around the world gather around the Seder table with family and friends to celebrate Passover.
"We remember the miracle of God's deliverance of His people from bondage to freedom; from the wilderness to the Promised Land, and from darkness to ‘great light.' We remember also the timeless reflection of Talmudic sage Ben Zomah, who explained that the miracle of Passover should be recounted specifically at night, because it is during our darkest moments when the hope for redemption must sustain and keep us.
"Today, millions of people continue to face oppression. ISIS is on the march and radical Islamic terrorists seek to destroy the Jewish culture and western way of life. Earlier this week, we witnessed terror strike again on the streets of Jerusalem. But we rest in the confidence that the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses continues to watch over those who seek Him.
"As we celebrate the gift of Passover, we give thanks for the Lord's promise in Exodus: ‘Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.'"
