    "Republican Bob Dole has cut President Clinton's lead in the presidential race to only 5.5 percentage points, according to the latest Reuters daily tracking poll issued on Friday.
"Clinton led with 42 percent, ahead of Dole's 36.5 percent in the poll of 1,200 likely voters conducted Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday by John Zogby Group International. Election Day is next Tuesday, Nov. 5.
"Reform Party candidate Ross Perot scored 8.4 percent and 11.2 percent remained undecided in the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
"Pollster John Zogby said that Clinton's lead in the Thursday's polling alone was only 3.5 points.
"Something is clearly happening out there. The number of undecided voters, which was growing earlier this week, dropped dramatically in Thursday's polling and most of those went to Dole,' he said.
"In Thursday polling, the undecided vote was down to 6.4 percent, from 15.3 percent earlier in the week."
