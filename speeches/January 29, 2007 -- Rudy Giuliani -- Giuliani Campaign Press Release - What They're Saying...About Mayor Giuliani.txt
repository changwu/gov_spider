COMMENTATORS
ABC News' George Will: "Let me – let me make the case for Giuliani. Just – you can argue as indeed I have so argued that his eight years as mayor of New York were the most successful episode of conservative governance in this country in the last 50 years, on welfare and crime particularly." (ABC's "This Week," 1/28/07)
ABC's Geoff Morrell: "So if America's mayor, as they call him, jumps into this race, he will certainly be a force to be reckoned with. In fact, he may be the most popular politician in the nation. Bill, our latest ABC News poll shows that 61% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Giuliani. Only Clinton is as well liked. That's former President Bill Clinton." (ABC News' "World News Saturday," 1/27/07)
GOP Strategist Greg Strimple: "Giuliani's national security credentials will allow him to span ideological divides in the Republican Party and win conservative votes." (Liz Sidoti, "Giuliani: Can Republican's Star Outshine Moderate Reputation With Party Conservatives?" The Associated Press, 1/25/07)
The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes: "[Mayor Giuliani] has got one thing that others don't have and that is proven leadership. He stood up after 9/11 and was a strong force in New York as mayor. And that hasn't gone away." (Fox News' "Fox And Friends," 1/29/07)
NBC's Chris Matthews: "I think he is the guy to beat." (NBC's "Today Show," 1/29/07)
Headline News' Glenn Beck: "From what I know about Rudy Giuliani, I agree with that he's a guy who believes in what he believes in and he's not a focus group. He's just a guy who believes it and he's going to do it." (Headline News' "Glenn Beck," 1/29/07)
Beck: "I have to tell you, I live in Connecticut and I lived here before Giuliani and saw a lot of New York before he took over and then saw it after he took over. The guy is amazing. And New Yorkers love this guy because of that. Because he took absolutely no prisoners." (Headline News' "Glenn Beck," 1/29/07)
The American Spectator's Philip Klein: "[T]hose pundits who write off Giuliani's chances would have gotten a different impression talking with active New Hampshire Republicans who listened to the former mayor's speech [at the NH GOP annual meeting]." (Philip Klein, "The Candidate," The American Spectator Online, 1/29/07)
GOP Strategist David Carney: "He has the ability to be one of our strongest general election candidates." (Scot LeHigh, "How Appealing Is Giuliani?" The Boston Globe, 1/30/07)
Republican Strategist Kellyanne Conway: "The thing that is special about Rudy, he has these cluster of intangibles that engage people where I don't think money counts as much or endorsements count as much. There is something special about him and maybe the country knows him best because of his handling of 9/11 and the events thereafter, but people who live in New York understand that this is a whole window into the soul of Rudy Giuliani's tenure as mayor. This is a more livable city, it has less crime, it is more beautiful, it is just a better place to live than it was before he got here, and I watched him, I went to his fundraiser in December here in Manhattan and I listened to him explain all the facts and figures and how he translates that into a presidential strategy." (NY1's "Inside City Hall," 1/29/07)
OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS
Former Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci (R): "The times we live in demand people with those leadership capabilities." (James W. Pindell, "Rebuffing Romney, Cellucci Supports Giuliani For President," The Boston Globe, 1/26/07)
Cellucci: "He's got a record of turning rhetoric into results. It's just not just some philosophical absolute. He's actually done the job in New York City. He has gotten those results. Who would not want a safer country? Who would not want a deficit turned into a surplus. Who would not want a president who is going to cut taxes and make it more affordable for the families of this country?" (MSNBC's "Hardball," 1/29/07)
Cellucci: "We need his kind of leadership. We need his hands-on approach. We need someone who doesn't just talk and talk but who gets the results. That's been his record in New York. That's what he'll do as the President of the United States." (MSNBC's "Hardball," 1/29/07)
