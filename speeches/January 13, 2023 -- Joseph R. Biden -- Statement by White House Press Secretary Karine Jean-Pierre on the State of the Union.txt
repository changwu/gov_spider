    The President is grateful for and accepts Speaker McCarthy's prompt invitation to address the peoples' representatives in Congress.
He looks forward to speaking with Republicans, Democrats, and the country about how we can work together to continue building an economy that works from the bottom up and the middle out, keep boosting our competitiveness in the world, keep the American people safe, and bring the country together.
