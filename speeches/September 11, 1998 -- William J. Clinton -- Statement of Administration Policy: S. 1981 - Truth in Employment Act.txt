    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Hutchinson (R) AR and 22 others)
The Administration strongly opposes S. 1981. If the bill were presented to the President, he would veto it.
S. 1981 would seriously erode fundamental National Labor Relations Act protections of workers' rights to organize by allowing businesses to fire or refuse to hire union organizers. The Administration is committed to preserving the rights of workers to organize in order to secure higher pay, greater benefits, and job protections.
