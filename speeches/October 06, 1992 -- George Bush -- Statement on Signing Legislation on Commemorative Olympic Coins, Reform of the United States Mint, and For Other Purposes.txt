    I am approving H.R. 3654, a bill "To provide for the minting of commemorative coins to support the 1996 Atlanta Centennial Olympic Games and the programs of the United States Olympic Committee, to reauthorize and reform the United States Mint, and for other purposes."
I am proud that the United States Mint, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, and the United States Olympic Committee have worked together to develop a unique coin program that offers the potential of $100 million in profits to be evenly divided between the two Olympic committees. By working together to maximize the sale of these coins we will assist our Olympic athletes. This program will also have a positive economic impact and help create jobs for the people of Georgia.
This is a wonderful opportunity to support those goals that are important to every citizen in this country -- the successful hosting of the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games of Atlanta, Georgia, and the continued participation of our athletes in the Olympic Games.
In approving this legislation, I must, however, note that certain provisions concerning the newly established Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund might be construed to infringe on my constitutional authority to determine what legislative proposals to submit to the Congress and to supervise and guide executive branch officials. I will construe these provisions so as not to interfere with the President's constitutional duties.
