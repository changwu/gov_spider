    The President has received a report on disturbances today at Indiantown Gap. In his opinion, the Federal Protective Service and backup military personnel acted properly in moving quickly and firmly to quell the disturbances and restore order.
He has been assured by the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice that any repeat of today's disturbances will also be met by firm and appropriate action. He's also been informed that in this case, none of those involved in the disturbances left the base.
The President wishes to emphasize that the hospitality of the American people does not include toleration of violent and illegal action against the personnel or property of the American Government. He also wishes to emphasize that the small minority who engage in such acts are by no means representative of the Cuban Americans who already live in this country or of the vast majority of those who have recently fled Cuba in search of freedom
