(House)
(Rep. Boehner, R-OH)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The legislation would provide two years of significant relief from sequestration for both defense and non-defense priorities, helping to grow the economy and build middle-class economic security by investing in education, job training and research while keeping America safe. The agreement would ensure that relief from sequestration is paid for in a balanced way, while also shielding programs that working families depend on and protecting Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries from harmful cuts. This bill also would raise the Nation's debt limit, preserving the full faith and credit of the United States.
The Administration urges the Congress to pass this bipartisan agreement and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact responsible, full-year FY 2016 appropriations - without ideological riders - based on this agreement in order to continue growing the Nation's economy and creating jobs.
