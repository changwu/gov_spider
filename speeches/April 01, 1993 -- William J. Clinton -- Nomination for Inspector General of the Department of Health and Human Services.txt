    The President announced today that he will nominate June Gibbs Brown, a former Inspector General at the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of the Interior, to be Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.
"HHS is the biggest civilian Agency of the Federal Government," said the President, "and it is imperative that it be managed as efficiently as possible. That is one of the central tasks that Secretary Shalala has taken on, and I am very pleased to be nominating someone of June Gibbs Brown's stature as Inspector General."
