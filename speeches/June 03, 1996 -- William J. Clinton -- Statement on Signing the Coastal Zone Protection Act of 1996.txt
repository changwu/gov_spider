    I have today signed into law H.R. 1965, the "Coastal Zone Protection Act of 1996." This legislation will continue support for programs under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) that balance coastal development with resource conservation.
The CZMA's voluntary Federal-State coastal management programs protect natural resources, stimulate coastal economic development, and help save lives and property. The programs also provide for monitoring of coastal conditions and research to address resource management issues.
Through their balanced approach and focus on Federal-State partnerships, CZMA programs have enjoyed bipartisan support throughout their 24-year history. The enactment of H.R. 1965 demonstrates our Nation's resolve to keep our coasts clean, healthy, and productive for generations to come.
