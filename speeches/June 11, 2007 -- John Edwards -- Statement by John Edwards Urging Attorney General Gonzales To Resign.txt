    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ As the U.S. Senate prepares to hold a vote of "no confidence" in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Senator John Edwards released the following statement urging Gonzales to resign. Edwards first called for Gonzales' resignation on March 13th, 2007.
"The American people deserve better than a politicized Justice Department and an Attorney General facing a 'no confidence' vote. Instead of playing politics, the Attorney General should be upholding the law. It's time for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to take responsibility for his role in the recent firings of federal prosecutors. Gonzales has betrayed the public trust and should resign."
