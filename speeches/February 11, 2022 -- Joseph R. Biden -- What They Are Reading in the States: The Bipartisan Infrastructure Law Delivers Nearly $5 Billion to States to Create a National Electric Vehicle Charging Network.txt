    Local news outlets across the country – from New York to Nevada – are reporting on the nearly $5 billion that will be made available to states by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build out a new, national electric vehicle (EV) charging network. The program, known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, will provide funding over five years to help states establish EV charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors, particularly along the Interstate Highway System. This is an important and historic step towards building a nationwide charging network that will make EV charging accessible for all Americans.
