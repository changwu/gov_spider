    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that former FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh will serve as Senior Advisor to the Rudy Giuliani campaign. Allbaugh will advise the campaign on general strategy and homeland security.
"Rudy Giuliani is the only candidate who will keep America on offense in the Terrorists' War on Us," said Joe Allbaugh. "The leadership he showed after 9/11 was an inspiration not only to New Yorkers but to the country. He knows what it takes to keep America safe, and as President, he will ensure that our country never goes back on defense in this war."
"Joe and I worked closely together in the aftermath of 9/11 to ensure that everything possible was being done to help victims and their families," Rudy Giuliani said. "He has significant experience in emergency management and I will look to him for sound advice and expertise."
