    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Bill France, Jr. Bill was a legend in the world of NASCAR whose passion and vision for stock car racing led the sport to the national prominence it enjoys today.
Bill brought racing's excitement to millions of new fans through his steadfast and innovative leadership. Bill also helped ensure that the NASCAR community found many ways to support the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces. Our thoughts and prayers are with the France family.
