    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Sherwood (R) PA)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 603, which would ensure that family members of victims of international aviation disasters receive just compensation and equitable treatment. The bill would implement a recommendation in the February 1997 report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security.
