    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, with Protocol, signed at Washington on March 4, 1994. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Convention replaces, with respect to Ukraine, the 1973 income tax convention between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It will modernize tax relations between the two countries and will facilitate greater private sector United States investment in Ukraine.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and related Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House,
September 14, 1994.
