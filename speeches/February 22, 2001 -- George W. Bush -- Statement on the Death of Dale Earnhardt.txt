    I have asked my close friend Joe Allbaugh to attend today's memorial service for Dale Earnhardt. I am saddened by the untimely loss of this American legend and want to express my deepest sympathy to his family, friends, and fans. Dale was an American icon who made great contributions to his sport. Dale's legacy will live on for millions of Americans. He was an inspiration to many.
