    Last week, the House of Representatives passed legislation to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. This morning, in celebration of the heroism of the civil rights movement, I spoke to members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at their 97th annual convention, here in Washington, DC. At the NAACP convention, I said that I looked forward to the Senate promptly passing the House bill without amendment. Today the Senate acted and voted to reauthorize this historic legislation.
The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation in our Nation's history. It has been vital to guaranteeing the right to vote for generations of Americans and has helped millions of our citizens enjoy the full promise of freedom.
I will be pleased to sign the Voting Rights Act into law, and I will continue to work with Congress to ensure that our country lives up to our guiding principle that all men and women are created equal.
