    (Columbia, S.C., November 4, 2019) â€” Tom Steyer 2020 Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves released the following statement after Dwane Sims, the staffer involved in downloading data from the Harris Campaign, offered his resignation from the campaign:
"Last week, the South Carolina Democratic Party turned off voter file access to the Steyer campaign for a short period of time. When it was reinstated, Dwane Sims, a former South Carolina Democratic Party employee, had access to other presidential campaign data. Within minutes of realizing this, Sims called the South Carolina Democratic Party to alert them, and the access was turned off by the party authorities.
"Over the weekend, the Steyer campaign placed Sims on paid administrative leave while we conducted an investigation. After that internal investigation, he resigned from the campaign.
"The Steyer campaign takes this issue very seriously. When we first learned about the matter, we conducted an internal investigation and wiped Mr. Sims' computer to make sure the data was completely deleted and that there was no access to other campaign data. We understand the sensitivity and importance of this information.
"We apologize to the South Carolina Democratic Party and the DNC. Tom Steyer and the Steyer campaign extend our deepest apology to Senator Kamala Harris and her campaign."
