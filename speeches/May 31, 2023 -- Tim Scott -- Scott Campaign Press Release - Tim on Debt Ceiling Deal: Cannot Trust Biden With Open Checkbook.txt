Tim Scott: The short answer is no. The long answer is when I think about what's in the deal, I find that two things are really important. Number one, that Kevin did a good job of figuring out how to negotiate with someone who did not wanna negotiate. The question I asked myself is at the end of the negotiation, is it in our best interest as a nation to allow Joe Biden, someone we cannot trust on spending, to have an open checkbook, no limit on the credit card until the end of his term? My answer is no. So the fact that the current deal allows for him to continue to spend however much he does with no limit is something that I can't support. Look backwards as well as forward. The one thing you'll see is last cycle, he had a $1.2 trillion deficit this fiscal year, a $2 trillion deficit. I can't imagine what we're looking at the next fiscal year if in fact there's no limit on the credit card.
