    We welcome President Soeharto's decision, which provides an opportunity to begin a process leading to a real democratic transition in Indonesiaâ€”an opportunity for the Indonesian people to come together and build a stable democracy for the future. We urge Indonesia's leaders to move forward promptly with a peaceful process that enjoys broad public support. The United States stands ready to support Indonesia as it engages in democratic reform.
