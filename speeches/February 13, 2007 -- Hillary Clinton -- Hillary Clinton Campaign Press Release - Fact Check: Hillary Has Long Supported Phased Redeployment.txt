    "Senator Obama is mistaken. Senator Clinton has long been on record in favor of a phased redeployment of our troops. In fact both she and Senator Obama voted in 2005 to begin such a withdrawal." -- Howard Wolfson
CLAIM
YESTERDAY, SEN. OBAMA CLAIMED HILLARY DOES NOT SUPPORT PHASED REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ: "I think the difference is -- and now again, I don't want to speak for her or her bill -- my understanding is that she calls for a cap on troops levels but does not begin a phased redeployment. And so that's a pretty substantial difference." [Barack Obama, 2/12/07]
FACT
IN NOVEMBER 2005, HILLARY AND SEN. OBAMA VOTED FOR PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "A campaign plan with estimated dates for the phased redeployment of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq as each condition is met, with the understanding that unexpected contingencies may arise." [Vote #322, To clarify and recommend changes to the policy of the United States on Iraq and to require reports on certain matters relating to Iraq, 11/15/05]
IN JUNE 2006, HILLARY AND SEN. OBAMA VOTED FOR PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "The amendment calls for the beginning of a phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of the year. Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, and Ken Salazar, D-CO, are cosponsors of the amendment." [Vote #182, To state the sense of Congress on United States policy on Iraq, 6/22/06]
IN SPEECH TO COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, HILLARY CALLED FOR PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "And thirdly, we do need to begin, I had hoped by the end of this year, a phased redeployment. I joined Senators Levin and Reed, and the Democratic leadership in the Senate and House, in proposing a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq during this year, 2006." [Council on Foreign Relations, 10/31/06]
IN RESPONSE TO IRAQ STUDY GROUP, HILLARY CALLED FOR PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "Today's report from the Iraq Study Group shows the growing bipartisan consensus that we need a dramatic change of course in Iraq, including a redeployment of American troops." [Statement, 12/6/06]
IN RESPONSE TO BUSH IRAQ SPEECH, HILLARY CALLED FOR PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "I continue to urge a strategy that places pressure on the Iraqi government to resolve the political crisis through phased redeployment of U.S. troops, establishes an Iraqi Oil Trust to end the stalemate over oil, and pursues an aggressive diplomatic strategy including an international conference of the regional parties to further the task of Iraq's stability." [Statement, 1/10/07]
ON TODAY SHOW, HILLARY CALLED FOR BILL THAT CAPS TROOPS AND BEGINS PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "I support putting a cap on the number of American troops as of January 1st. I support the beginning of a phased redeployment out of Baghdad and eventually out of Iraq completely." [Today Show, 1/17/07]
IN PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER VISIT TO IRAQ, HILLARY CALLED FOR PHASED REDEPLOYMENT: "In Iraq, the prescription is the opposite. Rather than an escalation of U.S. troops, which I do not believe will contribute to long-term success in Iraq, we should be beginning a phased redeployment of U.S. troops as a way to put pressure on the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security and future." [Press Conference, 1/17/07]
