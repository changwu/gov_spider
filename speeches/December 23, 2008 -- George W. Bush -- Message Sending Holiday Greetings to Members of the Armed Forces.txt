    To the Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces
Laura and I send season's greetings to you and your families during the holidays.
America is blessed to have brave citizens willing to step forward to defend our freedoms and keep us safe from our enemies. For many of you, this holiday season will be spent far from home, and our Nation honors your sacrifice. We remain mindful of your courage, ask God to watch over you, and pray for your safe return.
Your family members serve our country as well. During this time of year, they are a special source of hope and strength to you, and they both deserve and have the thanks and support of our whole Nation. Their selfless dedication sets an example of patriotism for all Americans to follow.
May God bless you and keep you safe, and may God bless America.
GEORGE W. BUSH
