    I speak for millions of Americans when mourning the death today of Les Aspin and join many others in saying that he was my friend.
As a Member of the House of Representatives for 22 years, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for 8, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Les rendered our Nation extraordinary, selfless service.
Les Aspin accomplished greatly because he cared greatly. He brought the same commitment to his most recent assignment that he brought to Washington as a young congressional aide, staff assistant at the Council of Economic Advisers, and Defense Department official in the 1960's.
No one knew better than he how Washington works, but he never thought of it as a game for its own sake. He was here to make a difference. And he did. He probed and helped shape a generation of American defense policies Les Aspin was unique. He brought the light and budgets, culminating in the decisive bottom-of his joy in living and the heat of his intellect up review of our military strategy, which he to every occasion. He never met a person who conducted as Secretary of Defense. didn't like him. And we all will miss him.
