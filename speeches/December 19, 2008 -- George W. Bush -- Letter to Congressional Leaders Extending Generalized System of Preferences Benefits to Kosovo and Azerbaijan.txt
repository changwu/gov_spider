    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 502(f)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act"), I am notifying the Congress of my intent to add the Republic of Kosovo (Kosovo) and the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan) to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
In Proclamation 8272 of June 30, 2008, I designated Serbia as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP program. On February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, and in light of Kosovo's independence from Serbia, I have determined that Kosovo should be designated as a separate GSP beneficiary developing country.
In addition, having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Azerbaijan should be designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP program.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
