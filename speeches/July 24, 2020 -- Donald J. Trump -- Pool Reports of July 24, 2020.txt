 In-town pool report #1 - no news 
Greetings from a soggy and overcast day at the White House. The sun is trying to break through, but the forecast has other ideas. As usual, White House medical staff checked your pooler's temperature this morning in lower press and swabbed the inside of his nose for a COVID-19 test. No news is good news, we've been told.
So far the President has two events on the schedule.
At 11 am, he is slated to award the Medal of Freedom to Jim Ryun, the legendary runner and former congressman from Kansas.
At 3 pm, he is scheduled to deliver remarks at the signing of an executive order on drug pricing.
President Trump plans to spend the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The Marine One departure from the White House should be at 4:30 pm.
I'll let you know if anything else comes up.

List of participants provided by Judd Deere:
Today, President Donald J. Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Jim Ryun. This prestigious award is the Nation's highest civilian honor, which may be awarded by the President to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.
Jim Ryun is one of the most accomplished American runners in history and a former United States Representative from Kansas. Despite being cut from every athletic team in junior high, Ryun made the track team at Wichita East High School, where he went on to break the world record for the mile and compete in the 1964 Olympic Games. While at the University of Kansas, Ryun broke several more world records, won the silver medal at the 1968 Mexico City Games, and competed in the
1972 Munich Games. Among many other accolades, he was named ABC Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year and earned the James E. Sullivan Amateur Athlete Award. Following his outstanding athletic career, Ryun honorably served his home State of Kansas in the United States Congress from 1996 to 2006. He has since written three books and currently gives motivational speeches around the country.
 The following individuals are expected to attend:

POTUS described Ryun as "a legendary running Olympian" and "an American patriot." He read a long introduction of Ryun's career as an elite runner and his work in Congress. "I wish we had him now" (in Congress), President Trump said.
Ryun's daughter and son also spoke. As his son described Ryun's humility, Ryun sighed deeply. Ryun is speaking now.
About 30 people are in the Blue Room. Your pooler doesn't see anyone in the audience wearing a mask. The press corps and White House staff standing in the wings are in masks.

 In-town pool report #7 - medal ceremony audience tested for COVID-19 before event -- info about Ivanka in CO 
I asked the White House why I didn't see people in the audience for the medal ceremony wearing masks. "Everyone was tested" (for COVID-19), said White House spokesman Judd Deere.
Also, I'm passing along this information about Ivanka Trump's meetings in Colorado today. It comes from a White House official. The official refused to give a reason for this read out being on background.
On Background from a White House Official:This morning at 8:30AM MDT/10:30AM EDT, Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump will join Senator Cory Gardner, Dr. Laurie Todd Smith with the Department of Labor, Lynn Johnson with the Department of Health and Human Services, and others for a tour and roundtable at Bright Beginnings Learning Center in Greenwood Village, CO. Following a tour of the center, they will participate in a discussion with the head of the facility, parents, care providers and local stakeholders on the important need to reopen child care centers for working families and best practices to ensure a healthy and safe return for all children and workers. This event will highlight Administration priorities of providing families with access to affordable and high-quality childcare, while also highlighting the need for Congressional action in the coming weeks to ensure continued operations and expanded access for parents.
CHILD CARE BACKGROUND: President Trump has prioritized the reopening of schools and childcare facilities as an essential step in our country's return to prosperity. The Administration advocated for an additional $3.5 billion in Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) funding during the CARES Act for low-income families and first-responders and also supported the Paycheck Protection Program for small business owners of which many child care faculties are small and women-owned. Advisor Trump has taken up the mantle of the administration's childcare priorities since the earliest days of the administration encouraging the expansion of child care options for families and addressing affordability throughout the system. As part of the administration's work, the President signed into law the largest ever expansion of the CCDBG to states from $3.9 to 5.8 billion and doubled the Child Tax Credit (CTC) from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. In tax year 2019, nearly 40 million families benefitted fromthe CTC, receiving an average benefit of $2,200 â€“ totaling credits of $88 billion.

Event is still going. Attendees in the audience are spaced with two seats between each other. Most people, but not all are wearing masks.
POTUS said the actions today would allow for the importation of cheaper drugs.
Epi pens have seen "horrible, horrible increases," Trump said. "We're changing that right now." Insulin: "massive cost savings.""I'm unrigging the system that is decades old."
He said the changes will eliminate some of the "middlemen" in drug purchases. "The middlemen are making a fortune." "People are just bilking Medicare patients." He said some people are not going to so rich anymore and joked: "I probably see them in Palm Beach."
POTUS said that representatives of drug companies will be at the White House on Tuesday. If "we don't agree to something" he will implement another order designed to ensure Medicare would pay the lowest price on the international market. He said that he would wait on that order until Aug. 24 and would not need it use it if drug
