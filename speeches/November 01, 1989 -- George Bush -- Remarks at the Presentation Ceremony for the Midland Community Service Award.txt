    Well, let me just say how pleased I am, as a former Midlander, to see -- [laughter]. This may make that, what do you call it, the blooper of the week. [Laughter] I'm sorry about that. You can go to your mother. [Laughter]
I will say this -- and you know, we talked about a Thousand Points of Light. And you see a community respond as yours did, sir, and then see one recognize this as -- having responded from the past itself -- and it really is a very moving thing.
I am so proud to be here and pleased to be a part of presenting this first award to you, and the tradition will continue. But please thank, sir, all those wonderful citizens that turned out. I was kept well-informed by your Senator and Congressman here, and I have been so impressed with that community spirit. I really think that beyond the borders of the United States you've set a wonderful example of one person helping another. So, you've responded, and we're very proud.
Thank you all. And as for you, Jessica -- [laughter] -- where's my handkerchief? [Laughter] How old are you now?
