    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 98-164, as amended, I herewith transmit the second annual report of the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers the period from October 1, 1984, through September 30, 1985.
I am pleased to forward this report, which summarizes the very important work that this organization has accomplished in the past year. The National Endowment for Democracy is a key instrument in our ability to support what we believe in around the world. The Endowment permits us to give assistance to democracy by strengthening those key sectors of society that represent the basis of a free society. One of the strengths of this organization is that it is constructed on a bipartisan basis. Its activities range from Chile to Poland, from South Africa to Nicaragua, and from the Philippines to Cuba. Although the Endowment has been in operation for less than two years, the enthusiasm and support with which the world's democrats have greeted this initiative has been very gratifying. The support of the Congress is essential for the continued growth of this vital program. This Administration strongly backs the National Endowment for Democracy and will work closely with the Congress to ensure the continued growth and expansion of this vital effort.
