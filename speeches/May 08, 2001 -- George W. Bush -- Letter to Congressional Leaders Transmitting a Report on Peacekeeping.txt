    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the 2000 Annual Report to the Congress on Peacekeeping required by section 4 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287b).
United Nations and other peacekeeping operations conducted under the previous Administration helped us protect U.S. interests before they were directly threatened and helped ensure that other nations shared with us the risks and costs of maintaining international stability.
I look forward to working with you to ensure that, under the right circumstances, peacekeeping remains a viable option for dealing with international conflicts.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
