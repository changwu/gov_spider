Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney today announced the first 15 members of the Romney for President California Leadership Team, a group of leading Californians who will support Governor Romney as he campaigns in the state and across the nation. California Senate Republican Leader Dick Ackerman and former Assemblyman Tony Strickland will serve as Chairmen of the effort.
"I am honored to have the backing of these dedicated leaders in the Golden State," said Governor Romney." Their record of service is proof that President Reagan's legacy is alive and well in California. We all believe that strong and unflinching leadership is once again needed to restore fiscal sanity in Washington, D.C."
With today's announcement, Senator Ackerman said, "In the private and public sectors, Mitt Romney has distinguished himself through his intellect and his commitment to innovation. The Republican Party must reestablish itself as the guardian of fiscal responsibility, and Governor Romney is the right leader to make that happen."
Joining Senator Ackerman, Tony Strickland added, "Governor Romney accomplished an impressive feat by bringing fiscal discipline to one of the nation's most liberal states. As a lifelong fiscal conservative, I am troubled by the spending binge we've seen at the federal level. Our nation needs a strong and tested leader like Mitt Romney to put our nation's finances back on track."
