Cynthia Telles and her family entered the ceremonial office at 1:24, observing the historic vice presidential desk on the south end of the room before the ambassador went back out. California Senator Alex Padilla and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra also joined at 1:28, chatting next to the room's large conference table.
The VP and the ambassador entered from the north end of the ceremonial office at 1:39. The VP is wearing a black suit and black heels.
She swore in Ambassador Telles with the normal pledge as of 1:40.
"I believe we have a Senator here … we have the Secretary here … and we have the chairman Mr. Ruiz," the VP said.
All guests and family gathered for a photo with the VP. The VP asked Sec. Becerra how he was and patted him on the shoulder before walking out at 1:42 while family and guests stayed to mingle.
Behind them are four alternating flags, two U.S. flags and two blue and white flags with the design of the presidential seal.
