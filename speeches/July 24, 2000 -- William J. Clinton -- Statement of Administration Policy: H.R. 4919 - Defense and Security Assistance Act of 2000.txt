    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Gilman (R) New York)
The Administration generally supports H.R. 4919, which would facilitate and improve U.S. security assistance to allies and partners. The Administration supports the objective of section 106, granting an exemption for exports of certain unclassified defense articles and services to treaty allies meeting strict U.S. Government requirements. The Administration, however, is concerned that section 106 (a) and (b) would constrain the President's flexibility to provide export licensing exemptions to foreign countries and will work with Congress to address this concern.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4919 would affect direct spending and revenue; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is under development.
