    Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that a major disaster exists in the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands and ordered Federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the territory due to Hurricane Maria beginning on September 16, 2017, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals on the island of St. Croix.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is available to the territory and to certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work in all of the islands in the territory.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures throughout the territory.
Brock Long, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named William L. Vogel as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional areas and forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are fully completed.
