    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on Malaria Awareness Day:
"Malaria kills more than a million people a year in Africa -- and a child every thirty seconds. Yet it is well within our grasp to defeat this disease. If elected President, I will pledge to end malaria in Africa.
"The United States has honored its proud history of global service by being a leader in the fight against malaria. At present, the federal government is on track to commit $1 billion each year. But America is more than its government. I call upon the private sector to meet its obligation to serve a cause greater than its self-interest by matching the federal commitment dollar for dollar. Meeting this goal will achieve a level of funding that will rapidly roll back the dreadful impact of malaria on the global community."
