    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Paul, R-KY)
The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J.Res. 26, a joint resolution disapproving arms sales to the Government of Qatar. This joint resolution relates to $3 billion in Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Qatar for twenty-four AH-64E Apache Attack helicopters. This package is intended for the sovereign defense of Qatar, which is host to United States Central Command forces and serves as a critical forward-deployed location in the region. In addition to the military personnel in Qatar, more than 15,000 United States citizens live on the Qatar Peninsula. The FMS case at issue supports the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important partner for political and economic progress in the Middle East. This FMS transaction will enhance long-term defensive and offensive capabilities on the Qatar Peninsula, as well as the protection of key oil and gas infrastructure and platforms. By supporting thousands of American jobs, this FMS transaction also helps to strengthen the United States defense industrial base and promotes economic security.
In addition to negatively affecting our bilateral relationship with Qatar, the joint resolution would significantly hinder interoperability between our nations. Qatar serves as a bulwark against Iran and its nefarious activities throughout the region, and it partners with the United States to counter al-Qa'ida and ISIS.
If S.J. Res. 26 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto it.
