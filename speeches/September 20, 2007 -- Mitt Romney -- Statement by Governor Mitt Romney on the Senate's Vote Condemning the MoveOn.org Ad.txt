Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the Senate's vote to condemn the MoveOn.org ad:
"Hillary Clinton had a choice. She could stand with our troop commander in Iraq, or she could stand with the libelous left wing of her party. She chose the latter. The idea that she would be a credible commander-in-chief of our armed forces requires the willing suspension of disbelief."
Background On Senate Vote:
Sen. Hillary Clinton Voted Against Senate Language Condemning The MoveOn Attack On Gen. David Petraeus. "To express the sense of the Senate that General David H. Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, deserves the full support of the Senate and strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all members of the United States Armed Forces." (S. Amdt. 2934, Roll Call Vote #344: Passed 72-25, 9/20/07)
