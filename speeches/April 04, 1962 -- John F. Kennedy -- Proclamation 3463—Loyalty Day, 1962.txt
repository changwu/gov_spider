  A Proclamation

Whereas this Nation, with its traditions of freedom, liberty, and justice under law, is the inspiration of free men and of others striving for freedom and justice throughout the world; and
Whereas the strength and vigor of this Nation is clearly attributable to the steadfast devotion and loyalty of its people; and
Whereas it is fit and proper to set aside a special day each year to give affirmative expression to our unceasing devotion and loyalty to this Nation and its free institutions and to give affirmative expression to our absolute repudiation and rejection of totalitarian concepts of_ either the left or the right; and
Whereas the Congress, by a joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369), has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies:
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe Tuesday, May 1, 1962, as Loyalty Day, in schools and other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of our people may join in the reaffirmation of their loyalty to the United States of America.
I also call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this Fourth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.

JOHN F. KENNEDY
