    South Korea
Q. What do you think of Korea?
The President. It's a terrific country. It's amazing all the things that have been done in such a short time. And the vibrancy of the democracy is really amazing. To think that President Kim just a few years ago was under house arrest and then he winds up being the President of the country; it's a real tribute to the people here as well as to their leaders.
North Korea
Q. What do you hope to accomplish with your visit to the DMZ this afternoon?
The President. First of all, since I'm in the country, I want to go up there and see our forces and tell them how much I appreciate what they're doing. Secondly, I want to reinforce the message that I issued yesterday in my meeting with President Kim and in my speech to the National Assembly.
Q. Why do you feel North Korea needs the message fight now?
The President. Because they are not fully in compliance with the NPT.
