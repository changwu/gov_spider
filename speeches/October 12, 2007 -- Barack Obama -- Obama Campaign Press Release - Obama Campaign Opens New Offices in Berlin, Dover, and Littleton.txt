    New additions bring total number of Obama for America New Hampshire offices to 14
Manchester, NH -- Senator Barack Obama's New Hampshire campaign announced today the opening of new regional field offices in Berlin, Dover and Littleton. The three new offices will be fully operational on Monday, and bring the campaign's total number of offices in the state to fourteen. Already up and running are regional offices in Concord, Conway, Derry, Keene, Laconia, Lebanon, Nashua, Peterborough, Portsmouth, and Rochester as well as our statewide headquarters in Manchester.
The campaign's regional offices support the grassroots organization that Obama has built in every corner of New Hampshire. Tomorrow, as part of our nationwide Canvass for Change, hundreds of Obama supporters will go door to door in 19 towns across the state to talk to their neighbors about Senator Obama's opposition to the war.
