MITT ROMNEY: "He is wrong, of course, and actually you watch that clip and he thinks this is all very funny. But there are a lot of people who have a hard time getting to and from work and being able to make ends meet after they've gone to and from work. You have got soccer moms who after they've dropped their kids off wonder can they afford to fill up their vehicle with gas again. There are a lot of people really suffering, having tough times right now because of these gas prices. I can cut through the baloney in the task force, and just tell him, 'Mr. President, open up drilling in the Gulf. Open up drilling in ANWR. Open up drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. Drill in North Dakota. Drill in Oklahoma and Texas. Let's start getting our oil resources. And, by the way, let's also start opening up our natural gas resources instead of having it held up by the EPA so that can ultimately become a transportation fuel. And by the way, let's take advantage of our coal resources as well. Mr. President, you seem to like electric cars but you know, they take electricity. That means coal.' The President is looking for someone to blame and he ought to look in the mirror. I know he likes alternative energy but I would rather see an alternative president."
