LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Today, the campaign of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul released fundraising totals from its second quarter FEC report. The presidential campaign pulled in $4.518 million for the quarter. With $2.97 million on hand, added to a transferable $1.05 million from Paul's Congressional campaign committee, it can report $4 million cash on hand in donations, which have come in mainly from a legion of small donors.
"Our campaign has a broad base of small donors who are energized by Dr. Paul's message of limited government and individual liberty," said Jesse Benton, Ron Paul 2012 campaign chairman. "And unlike other candidates in this race, none of these contributions are for the general election, meaning they can all be put toward the nomination process."
