    "[Sen. Santorum's] a strong defender of earmarks. I oppose earmarks. I want to absolutely end earmarks. He grew government when he was in Washington by some 80%, and voted to raise the debt ceiling five different times — and did so without looking for compensating cuts in the federal spending. I balanced the budget in my state for the four years that I was there, and put together a rainy day fund. So we have very differing views and a very different history, on earmarks, on spending and on borrowing." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Probably the biggest differences in the race in Maine may revolve around Senator Santorum and myself. He's a strong defender of earmarks. I oppose earmarks. I want to absolutely end earmarks. He grew government when he was in Washington by some 80%, and voted to raise the debt ceiling five different times — and did so without looking for compensating cuts in the federal spending. I balanced the budget in my state for the four years that I was there, and put together a rainy day fund. So we have very differing views and a very different history, on earmarks, on spending and on borrowing."
