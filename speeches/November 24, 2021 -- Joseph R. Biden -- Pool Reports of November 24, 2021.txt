Travel pool report #1 - Travel photo lid
Good morning from Nantucket where the White House called a travel photo lid at 9:52 am, shortly before the pool's 10 am call time.
There was nothing public on POTUS' schedule for today. Pooler has asked for a readout of any calls or activities and will pass along anything received.
It is a blistery 34 degrees and windy here.
Enjoy your Wednesday and Happy Thanksgiving!

White House travel report 2a - text of memo
The White House reminds your pooler they can't send out attachments.
The text from the attachment is below and I tweeted out the memo document at https://twitter.com/emilylgoodin/status/1463683647014326274?s=21
The following is released with permission of the patient.
As previously reported in my 19 November 2021 memorandum, President Biden had a benign appearing 3 mm polyp removed from his ascending colon. The specimen was sent for histologic examination.
The excised specimen has been identified as a tubular adenoma. This is similar to the polyp which he had removed in 2008. A tubular adenoma is a benign, slow-growing. but thought to be potentially pre-cancerous lesion for which no further action is required at this time. Routine surveillance is recommended for this finding. Typically, repeat colonoscopy in 7 to 10 years is recommended.
