    I commend the House for making great progress toward passing a jobs-and-growth package that will spur economic growth and create jobs for American workers. The tax relief package passed by the House today includes all of the elements of my original plan, including accelerating all income-tax rates, increasing small-business expensing, increasing the child credit, delivering significant marriage penalty relief, and addressing the unfair double tax on dividends. I look forward to building on this success to deliver the economic boost America's workers deserve.
