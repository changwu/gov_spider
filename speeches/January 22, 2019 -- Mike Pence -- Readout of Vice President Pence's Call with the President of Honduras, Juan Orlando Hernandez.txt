    Vice President Pence called the President of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, today to reiterate the strong and collaborative relationship between the United States and Honduras, and to discuss efforts by both countries to stem the flow of illegal immigration. Vice President Pence commended President Hernandez for the proactive and vigorous response to the most recent migrant caravans, including the arrest of several organizers, and encouraged Honduras and other Northern Triangle countries to redouble their efforts. The two leaders also discussed opportunities to work together to fight against illegal gangs and improve the security and prosperity of people in Central America and the United States. The Vice President reiterated the United States' commitment to building a closer relationship with the Hernandez Administration and disavowed any efforts by opportunistic political actors to distract from our priorities.
