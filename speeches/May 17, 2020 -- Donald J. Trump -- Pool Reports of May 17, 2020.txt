 Pool Report #3 
POTUS took just two questions over about one minute before heading into the White House, both asking his reaction to President Obama's commencement remarks. POTUS at first did not respond directly (and may not have heard the question over the chopper blades) and instead said "we had a great weekend" and were making "tremendous progress" in working toward a cure for the coronavirus.
Asked a second time, he said he had not seen Obama's remarks but added: "Look, he was an incompetent president, that's all I can say. Grossly incompetent."With that, he pivoted away and strode into the White House accompanied by several people in suits, including Rick Grenell.
We now have a travel lid as of 1:14 pm.

 Pool Report #4 
Here's a fuller version of his first comment, which was very hard to hear over the chopper noise: "So I think we had a great weekend. We did a lot of terrific meetings. Tremendous progress is being made on many fronts, including coming up with a cure for this horrible plague that has beset our country. ... It was a working weekend, it was a good weekend. A lot of very good things have happened."
That's it for us today. Have a great rest of your weekend and stay healthy.
