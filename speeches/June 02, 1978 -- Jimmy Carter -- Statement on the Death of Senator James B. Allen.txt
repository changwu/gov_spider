    With the death of Senator James B. Allen of Alabama, the Senate has lost one of the great masters of parliamentary procedure in the long tradition of Southern Senators.
He was an honorable and indefatigable fighter for his beliefs and a man of great personal integrity. I extend my deepest sympathy to his family.
