I believe that you have to have folks that have the kind of capacity and experience that we have to get America back on track."â€” Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney: "[Paul Ryan] is a man who's dedicated the last 14 years working in Washington in ways that are not highly partisan or political, but instead are focused on what he thinks the right course is for America. And that's the kind of person I want. This is a man who's also very analytical. He's a policy guy. People know him as a policy guy. That's one of the reasons he has such respect on both sides of the aisle. I'm a policy guy, believe it or not. I love policy. I love solving tough problems. And we face real challenges around the world, places like Syria, Egypt, Iran. We've got real problems. Domestically, you have 23 million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work. The President has not been able to get this economy going. I believe that you have to have folks that have the kind of capacity and experience that we have to get America back on track."
