    Thank you. Well, we want to thank John and Jonathan and Mary Chapin Carpenter. And at least from my part, I know how hard it is to do anything when you're hoarse. [Laughter]
It doesn't get any better than this. You were wonderful. We thank you. It's been wonderful for Hillary and for me to have all of you here. There will be music out in the foyer and a little dancing if you have a little of that spirit.
I will say this: For all of us who come from small towns all across America, I wish I had a nickel for every time I drove through that town you sang about tonight. [Laughter]
Thank you all. God bless you, and good night.
