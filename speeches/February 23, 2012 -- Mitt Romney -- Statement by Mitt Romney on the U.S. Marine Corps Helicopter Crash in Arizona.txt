    Mitt Romney made the following statement on the helicopter crash in Arizona that killed seven U.S. Marines:
"My heart goes out to the victims and their families of today's tragic helicopter collision here in Arizona. Those who serve in our armed forces take risks and face dangers both on and off the battlefield. For defending our country, for volunteering to put themselves in harm's way, the men and women of our military deserve our most solemn gratitude."
