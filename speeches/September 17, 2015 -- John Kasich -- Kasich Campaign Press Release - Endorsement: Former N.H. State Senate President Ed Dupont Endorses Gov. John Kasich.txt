Dupont to serve as a New Hampshire State Co-Chair for Kasich for America
Today, former New Hampshire State Senate President Ed Dupont endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President, saying "John Kasich is the Republican who will win the White House in 2016." Dupont will serve as a New Hampshire State Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign.
"John Kasich is exactly the leader America needs right now. Having served five terms as a State Senator, I know a successful Governor when I see one, and Governor Kasich is a successful Governor. He turned Ohio around. He cut taxes, balanced budgets, found innovative ways to make government work better, and returned power to citizens. With his skills, experience, and vision, imagine what John Kasich can accomplish in the Oval Office," said Dupont.
Ed Dupont is President of the Dupont Group and is a former five term State Senator who also served as President of the New Hampshire State Senate. He is a former Chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and served on the Board of Directors of UNH School of Law. Dupont received the New England Board of Higher Education 2014 David C. Knapp Award for Trusteeship in recognition of his years of exceptional leadership on behalf of higher education.
Said Kasich, "I am thrilled to welcome aboard Ed Dupont to our New Hampshire team and I'm grateful for his confidence in our campaign. Ed was a smart, effective legislator, he remains deeply involved and influential in state government and politics, and he values the importance of good government as much as I do. With the addition of Ed to our New Hampshire operation, our already solid New Hampshire team instantly becomes even stronger."
