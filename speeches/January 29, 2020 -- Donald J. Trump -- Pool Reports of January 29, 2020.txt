Pool report #5 — Opening remarks at signing
Jared and Ivanka arrived at 11:09 am and sat in the front row. The president and vice president arrived shortly after. The president opened by complimenting the musicians, and the sun mercifully came out to warm everyone up a bit as the president arrived.
"Today we are ending the NAFTA nightmare," the president opened.
Some quick quotes. Will send more soon.
On the border/the wall:
"Other countries are now looking at it but they can't be a border like that, because believe it or not that is by far the biggest border, anywhere in the world in terms of economy, in terms of people. There's nothing even close. This is a colossal victory for our farmers, ranchers energy workers factory workers and American workers in all 50 states, and you could almost say beyond, because it's all beyond. This is all over the world, even though it's at one beautiful border, where by the way a very major powerful wall is right now being built."
"It's a day of great celebration in all three countries."
On Grassley's involvement:
"He was brutal. He would call me he would say how is it going? How is it going? And with Chuck you don't mess around."
On complimenting senators/the impeachment trial:
"Maybe I'm just being nice because I want their vote. I don't want to leave anyone out. Congressman, I already got your vote."
Mentioned Cornyn, said his poll numbers looked good and added that he doesn't have to deal with Beto.

"We have a president who will always put America first."Lighthizer made some remarks following Pence's. "I mostly want to thank the president of the United States... To do this and to do it under these circumstances is a monumental part of your legacy," he said.
