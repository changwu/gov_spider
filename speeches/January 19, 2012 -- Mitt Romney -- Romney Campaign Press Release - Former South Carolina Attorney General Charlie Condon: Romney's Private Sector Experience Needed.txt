    Former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon made the following statement on tonight's debate:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate. Unlike our current president, Mitt Romney actually knows how the economy works, how jobs are created, and how businesses grow. With his economic know-how and solid economic plan, South Carolinians can be confident that our future will be bright with Mitt Romney in the White House."
