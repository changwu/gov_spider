    Due to the President's travel to Tennessee on Friday, President Bush will now welcome Amadou Toumani Tour of the Republic of Mali to the White House on February 12, 2008. This visit will provide an opportunity for the President to get a progress update from President Tour on key U.S. initiatives including the President's Malaria Initiative, the President's International Education Initiative, and the Millennium Challenge Account. The two leaders will use the opportunity to discuss the shared goal of advancing democracy and human rights worldwide, including through the Community of Democracies. They will also discuss insecurity in northern Mali and the fight against terrorism.
