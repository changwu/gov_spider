Out-of-Town pool report #4 -Marine 1 departure from Delaware 
The motorcade arrived at the breezy New Castle Air National Guard Base at about 5:42 p.m.
Because of the way Marine 1 was positioned due to the wind, it was hard to see POTUS getting on but am told grandchildren Natalie and Hunter were with him.
Marine 2 lifted off at about 5:50 p.m.
Handing off to in town pool.

Out-of-Town pool report #5 - correction 
The second reference to the helicopter in the last pool report should have said Marine 1 and NOT Marine 2. (Apologies for any confusion caused by your pooler who was used to covering the VP.)
