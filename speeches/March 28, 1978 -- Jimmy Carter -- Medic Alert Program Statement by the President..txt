    The high quality of medical services in the United States continues to be a source of national pride. Too often, however, we tend to regard the responsibility for the quality of the medical treatment we receive as resting solely with health care professionals. We often overlook our own responsibility to assure that these professionals have the information necessary to provide proper and effective treatment, especially in emergencies.
For over 20 years, the Medic Alert Foundation International has dedicated itself to serving persons with hidden or special medical problems that cannot easily be seen or recognized. When, in time of emergency, its members may be unable to communicate, the Medic Alert bracelet or necklace indicates the general condition. A wallet card provides more details, and through its unique 24-hour, worldwide emergency medical answering system, Medic Alert gives medical personnel that individual's current situation. Persons with heart conditions, diabetes, epilepsy, and severe allergies, and those who are taking special medication are among the ninny whose lives have been saved through the Medic Alert system. Indigent people can receive this valuable service free.
It is appropriate that the people of the United States consider the contributions to the public health of the Medic Alert program.
I applaud the contributions of the Medic Alert program to the public health, and urge Americans to give the Medic Alert program their full support.
