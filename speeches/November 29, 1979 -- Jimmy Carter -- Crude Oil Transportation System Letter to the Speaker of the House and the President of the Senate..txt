    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing you concerning my decision on a west-to-east crude oil transportation system under Title V of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617).
Title V of PURPA provided for the submission of proposals for the construction of a west-to-east crude oil transportation system. It directed the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation with heads of appropriate Federal agencies, to establish an expedited schedule for conducting reviews and making recommendations concerning the submitted proposals. It required that the Interior Secretary secure recommendations from other Federal agencies and comments from State and local governments and the general public. He was then directed to prepare a report containing those recommendations and comments, together with his own recommendations, and submit it to the President. On October 15, 1979, Secretary Andrus submitted his report and recommendations to me.
Section 507 (a) of Title V directs the president to issue his decision concerning the proposals within 45 days after receipt of the report, or within 60 days thereafter if he determines, and so notifies the Congress, that additional time is necessary. Pursuant to that section, by this letter I am notifying you of my determination that additional time will be required to permit thorough consideration of the Secretary's recommendation, and of additional information on unresolved issues.
I will reach a decision expeditiously thereafter.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
