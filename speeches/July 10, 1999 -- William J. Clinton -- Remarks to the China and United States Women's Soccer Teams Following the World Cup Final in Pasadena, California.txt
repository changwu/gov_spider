    The President. I want to say to the whole team how much we admire your performance in the whole World Cup. You were magnificent today, and we were very honored to have you in our country. You will win many more games.
[After greeting China's team, the President proceeded to the locker room of the champion U.S. team.]
The President. Let me say one thing. First of all, I think everybody in the whole stadium was weeping with joy. It was the most exciting sports event, I believe, I've ever seen. We were so very proud of you.
I also want you to know, I just went in to see the Chinese team. I told them what a magnificent game they played, how honored we were to have them in our country. And they could not have been more generous. They said how well you played and that you deserved to win. I mean, it was an amazing day.
We learned a lot today about soccer, about women athletes, about courage and endurance, and about genuine sportsmanship. I cannot thank you enough for the gift that you have given to the United States, which is even bigger than this great trophy. [Applause] Wait, wait, wait.
And you see I brought a lot of people here who are big fans of yours, but I'd like our host Governor, the Governor of California, to say——
[At this point, Gov. Gray Davis of California made brief remarks.]
