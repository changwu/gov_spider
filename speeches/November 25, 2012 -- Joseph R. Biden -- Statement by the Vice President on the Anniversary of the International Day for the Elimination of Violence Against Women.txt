    Millions of women and girls around the globe face violence in their homes and neighborhoods, their schools and workplaces, refugee camps and conflict zones. We have made progress in addressing this violence, and our Administration has taken unprecedented steps to advance the status of women and girls worldwide. But for far too many women the daily threat of violence persists. Ending this problem requires the concerted effort of the international community, civil society, and the many unsung heroes who work tirelessly to stop violence against women in their own communities. On this International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, we reaffirm our commitment to women and girls who suffer from violence. We believe that no country can move forward unless women and girls have the opportunity to achieve their full potential, and we pledge to stand together in building a world where everyone can pursue their dreams without living in fear.
