    Former Wisconsin State Senator and Romney for President Wisconsin State Chairman Ted Kanavas made the following statement on Rick Santorum's suggestion that four more years of President Obama would be preferable to Mitt Romney:
"Senator Santorum is going off the rails. To suggest that four more years of Barack Obama is better than electing Mitt Romney is ridiculous and demonstrates his lack of commitment to conservative principles."
Republicans need to unite around our nominee in order to undo the damage caused by President Obama's failed policies and restore America's promise. Senator Santorum is not only damaging himself with his ill-advised comments, he's damaging the conservative movement. In the future, he should think before he speaks."
