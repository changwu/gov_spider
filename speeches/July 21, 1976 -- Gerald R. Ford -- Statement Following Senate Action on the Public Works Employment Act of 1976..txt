    I DEEPLY regret today that the Senate has overridden my veto of the public works bill.
Both the Senate and I share a keen desire to expand job opportunities for all Americans, but I continue to believe that the wisest, most productive means of reaching that goal is through a steadily growing private sector--not through temporary jobs that are run by the Government, increase the national debt, and create new inflationary pressures.
The House can rectify the Senate action on Thursday and should, in the best interest of the Nation, sustain my veto.
