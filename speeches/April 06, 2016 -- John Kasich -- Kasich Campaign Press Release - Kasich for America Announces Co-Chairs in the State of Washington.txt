    Today Kasich for America announced Ohio Governor John Kasich's co-chairs in Washington.
"We've assembled a solid team in Washington to support Governor Kasich," said Rob McKenna, former attorney general of Washington and a former candidate for governor. "Governor Kasich is a proven leader with a strong record of actually balancing budgets, bringing fiscal sanity to government and focusing on what matters most to the America peopleâ€” jobs and the economy. Further, he is the only candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall. A vote for either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump in May is effectively a vote for Clinton in November."

With their help, we will continue to focus on my positive message of bringing fiscal sanity and common-sense solutions to DC for a more accountable, less costly government."
