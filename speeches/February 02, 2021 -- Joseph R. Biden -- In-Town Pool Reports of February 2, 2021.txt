POTUS spoke for a total of five minutes, outlining the three executive orders before signing each.
ON FBI shootings: "Our hearts go out to the families of the FBI special agents"
"I was briefed on this tragedy earlier in the day and I know the FBI gathered information how this happened, what happened. But I can't imagine how these families are feeling today.
POTUS said the families of those "in a combat zone, in the military or an FBI agent or a police officerâ€¦ dreads the possibility of that call, of receiving that phone call."
Said he's not had an opportunity to contact the families of the FBI agents
"By and large the vast vast majority of men and women are decent and honorable people who put themselves on the line.
ON IMMIGRATION
Congratulates Secretary Mayorkas, standing to the right behind him, and says "I'm looking forward to his leadership and working with Congress on a lot of issues, including immigration bill that has I think great support in both chambers."
"I want to make it clear. There's a lot of talk, with good reason, about the number of executive orders that I sign. I'm not making the law. I'm eliminating bad policy."
POTUS said the previous president "issued executive orders that are very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to our country."
"We're going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration and literally, not figuratively, rip children from the arms of their families the mothers and fathers of the border with no plan. None whatsoever to reunify children who are still in custody and their parents."

"The second action addresses the root causes of migration to our southern border. And the third action, the third order to be signed order is a full review of the previous administration's harmful and counterproductive immigration policies."
On the second order, POTUS says it creates "a comprehensive regional framework to address the causes of migration and manage migration throughout the Northern and Central America, to provide a safe and orderly processing of asylum seekers at the United States border."
On third order, POTUS says it "restoring faith in our immigration system, and strengthening immigration and inclusion efforts for new Americans."
