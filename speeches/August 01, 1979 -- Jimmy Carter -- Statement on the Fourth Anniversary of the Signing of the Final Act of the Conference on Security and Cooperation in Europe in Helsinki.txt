    On this day in 1975, the leaders of 35 states met in Helsinki to sign the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). They pledged to build a future of peace and stability in Europe on the strong foundation of mutual understanding and respect for fundamental human rights.
In the years since Helsinki, we have witnessed conscientious efforts on the part of many signatory states to fulfill, fully and completely, their obligations under the Final Act. We have made progress in ensuring the freer flow of people and ideas. Flagrant abuses of human rights no longer go unnoticed and unchallenged. The Final Act provision which calls for notification of large military maneuvers has worked well. The spirit of Helsinki is alive. But there have also been important setbacks. For example, in the German Democratic Republic, harsh new laws designed to restrict contact with foreigners will take effect today, on the anniversary of Helsinki. In Czechoslovakia, members of the Charter 77 movement remain in prison, facing trial for their dedication to basic human freedoms. In the Soviet Union, organizations established to monitor compliance with the Helsinki agreement have been harassed and their members jailed. Acts like these are totally inconsistent with pledges made at Helsinki.
On the anniversary of the Helsinki accords, I rededicate this administration and this Nation to strive tirelessly for full implementation of the Final Act. We will continue to review our own record in preparation for the meeting of CSCE states at Madrid in 1980. And we call upon other signatory states to work with us so that we may mutually fulfill the obligations undertaken at Helsinki to peace, security, and human rights.
