    Thank you very much. Hey, you guys ready for a 45-minute speech, okay? Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Here is a man suggesting that we change control of the United States Congress. He is right. That's what some of this election is going to be about.
Let me salute the Governor, let me salute Governor Edgar and say what a great job he and the Lieutenant Governor and others are doing for this country. Let me tell you, it is absolutely essential that we get more support in the United States Senate. So vote for Rich Williamson here and send him to Washington.
Let me just say this -- I won't talk but a second -- we have indeed changed the world. Now I need your help in getting this country on the move, changing America for the values we all believe in. And we can do it.
I've never seen such a strange political year, but I'll tell you this: When that convention in Houston is over, I am going to come out and go after that opponent. He's been on my case for 6 months. We are going to define it, and we are going to win the election -- 6 months, 6 months of distorting the great Republican record. I'm going to take the case to the people, and we will win in November.
Thank you all very much. Thank you very, very much. Now go dry out.
