    Donald Trump Hires the Foreign Students He Wants to Ban from Working 
The only thing consistent about Donald Trump's position on immigration is that if he's talking about a given policy, he's probably already taken advantage of it for his own benefit.
The latest example: He's proposed to cut off work permits for 300,000 student visa holders a year, saying it's bad for Americans, and yet he's hired them to work at his businesses.
The Associated  Press reports:

  If elected president, Donald Trump has pledged to scrap a work visa program that brings 300,000 student workers each year to the U.S. Among the businesses that would be forced to stop hiring foreign labor: Trump's own.
The visa, known as the J-1, purports to offer a "cultural exchange" and give American businesses access to guest workers' "specialized skills," according to the State Department. Trump says it's a simply a conciliatory gesture aimed at corporate interests seeking cheap labor — and he'd replace it "with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program."
Yet Trump's hotel in Chicago has been a regular user of J-1 visas, according to workers at the hotel and Irish students who worked there. The nexus of the hiring has been the hotel's elite Terrace Restaurant, though other J-1 students have been placed at reception and at other hotel eating establishments. . . .
In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, Trump said that his approach to J-1 visas would be different as president than it had been as a businessman.

But given that Trump has been all over the place about what his own immigration policy is, there's no reason to trust that he'll keep his promises.
Marco's made clear where he stands on immigration and other issues — Americans deserve better than a con man like Trump.
