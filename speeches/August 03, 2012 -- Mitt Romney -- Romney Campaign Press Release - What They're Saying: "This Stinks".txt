Fox Business Network's Ray Hennessey: "That Makes That Unemployment Rate Number A Really, Really Bad Number..." HENNESSEY: "That, however, did not happen here and so, that makes that unemployment rate number a really, really bad number, that rise, kind of troubling, because you still have 155,000 people leave the work force. And if you listen to what Rich just said about that U-6 number, the so-called real unemployment rate, that's 15%. That means that only 85% of this country is actually working who can work. And you look at the labor force participation rate, that's going down to 63.7%, meaning more people who should be working aren't. So you continue to have a very discouraged labor force."

The number of hires that we're looking at are still kind of the same level we've been at since 2009, that's not a great statistic. So I kind of see us muddling along." (CNBC's "Squawk Box," 8/3/12)
