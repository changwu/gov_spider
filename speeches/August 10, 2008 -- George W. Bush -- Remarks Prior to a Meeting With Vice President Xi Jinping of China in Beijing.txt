Vice President Xi. I'm very familiar with you, Mr. President, because you are always in the limelight of international media. [Laughter] And I'm very happy to have this opportunity to meet you and get acquainted with you.
President Bush. Thank you.
Vice President Xi. That's why the fact that you've come to attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games shows your support for the Chinese efforts to host this Olympiad, and it also shows your understanding and respect for the Chinese people to host these games.
The U.S. delegation is a very powerful and strong delegation, and you still have a overwhelming and very obvious edge in athletic sports. And I would like to wish American athletes every success and you good performance at the Beijing Olympic Games.
President Bush. Thank you, sir.
Vice President Xi. Just now you had a friendly meeting with President Hu Jintao, and I know later on you are going to have a meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao. I'm very happy to have this opportunity to learn about your views and opinions.
