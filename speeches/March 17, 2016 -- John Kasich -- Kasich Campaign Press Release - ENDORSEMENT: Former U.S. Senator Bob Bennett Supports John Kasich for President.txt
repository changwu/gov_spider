    Today Former U.S. Senator Bob Bennett announced his endorsement of Gov. John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America Utah leadership team.
Said Bennett, "I've met every President since JFK and have an appreciation of what the job really takes. Governor Kasich is the only candidate left who has the skills we need. It takes a tremendous amount of skill and determination to balance the federal budget, but John Kasich has made a career out of accomplishing the improbable. As Governor of Ohio he balanced the budget without raising taxes, and he helped bring over 400,000 jobs back to the state. I have complete faith in his ability to revitalize our economy and strengthen our national defense using conservative, commonsense ideas."

Bennett served in the U.S. Senate from 1993-2010, holding the position of Chief Deputy Majority Whip and sitting on numerous committees, including the Joint Economic Committee, Rules and Administration Committee and Appropriations Committee. In the Senate he received high ratings from the American Conservative Union, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Rifle Association and other conservative groups. He currently works as a political consultant and researcher in Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C.
Said Kasich, "I have an enormous amount of respect for Senator Bob Bennett, a public servant who is widely recognized for his integrity, intelligence and ability to build bridges. As we continue to run a campaign on unity, not division, I'm honored to welcome a proven consensus-builder to our team."
