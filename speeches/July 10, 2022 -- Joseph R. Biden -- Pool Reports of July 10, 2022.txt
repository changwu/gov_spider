WH travel pool report 2 — bike ride, outbound, says women should keep on protesting Dobbs, considering public health emergency
The president passed by the pool on his way north to the Gordons Pond trail, stopped to talk to the media for two minutes, advising the hundreds outside the WH protesting the Dobbs decision to "keep protesting, keep making your point."
Asked if he is considering declaring a public health emergency regarding abortion access, Biden said he is asking his staff to see "whether I have the authority" and what the impacts would be.
He pointed as he came to a stop that he had removed the toe clips on his bike.

WH travel pool report 3 — fuller quotes.
The president spoke to the pool for just over two minutes, starting at 1112.
His message to women protesting the Dobbs decision:
"Keep protesting. Keep making your point. It's critically important. We can do a lot of things to accommodate the rights of women. In the meantime, fundamentally, the only way to change this is to have a national law that reinstates Roe v Wade."
He said he could do come things to help women access abortion, such as the ability to cross state lines and protecting private information, but ultimately a law was necessary.
"As president I don't have the authority to say that we're going to reinstate Roe V Wade as the law of the land. "
"My ultimate goal is to reinstate Roe v wade as a national law by passing a law through the United States Congress and I'll sign it."
The president was wearing a blue shirt, black shorts and his Ray-bans as he rode up on his dark gray, Trek hybrid bike equipped with disc brakes. He was surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents, their guns in cases slung over their backs.
As he came to a stop, he pointed down to the right hand pedal and laughed.
"I want you to know an important thing: I took off the … thing."
In the middle of answering a question, he remembered he was wearing his bike helmet:
"I look like a fool here in this interview."
"I put this helmet on because it was a tough interview."

The president arrived in his motorcade, stepped out of his SUV, and climbed aboard Marine 1 at 1951, preceded by First Lady Jill Biden, with a salute to the Marines flanking the forward stairs.
The pool was positioned a good 100 yards away and there was no opportunity for questions.
At 1955, the helicopter is aloft and circling around to a heading back to Washington, about an hour away.
Handing off to the in-town pool for arrival.
