    DENVER — Bennet for America today announced its Students for Bennet Steering Committee, a group of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who will lead their peers across the country in supporting Michael Bennet for president. The formation of this group reflects Bennet's focus on investing in the next generation.
Just this week, the University of Chicago Democrats held a "mock caucus," where the news headline coming out of the event was, "Bennet Makes Surprising Showing in 'Mockus' Dominated by Progressives." Representatives from campaigns for Michael Bennet, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders all reached viability.
"From undergrads to medical students, at large universities and small colleges across the country, it is clear that Michael's vision for our country's future resonates with the next generation of Americans," said Bennet for America spokesperson Shannon Beckham. "As the first superintendent to ever run for president, Michael will lead from the White House to transform our schools and economy to give every kid a real shot at success."
Bennet's Real Deal agenda makes a substantial investment in students by making college debt free for low- and middle-income families; making community college free for all students; reducing student debt burdens; and investing in the 70% of Americans who graduate from high school but don't have a four-year degree so they can earn a living wage, not just the minimum wage.
The students who form the steering committee represent a diverse set of experiences — attending schools of differing sizes, in states across the country, from high schools to graduate schools. Bennet's support among students transcends state lines and sports conferences; he has garnered support from students in varying regions of the country, from the University of Iowa to Spartanburg Methodist College in South Carolina.
