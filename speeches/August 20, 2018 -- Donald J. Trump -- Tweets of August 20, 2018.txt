Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone....Retweets: 18757Favorites: 75766

Where's the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction!Retweets: 24175Favorites: 94672

I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country's history brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won't sue!Retweets: 30909Favorites: 113982

Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it's worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn't because of the good job he did! He is a political 'hack.'Retweets: 27143Favorites: 104676

Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions 'Justice' Department? A total joke!Retweets: 21378Favorites: 80910

'Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn't happen.' Darrell Issa House Oversight. We can take out the word 'apparently.' @FoxNewsRetweets: 17795Favorites: 67332

It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can and must END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT ' and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay!Retweets: 28452Favorites: 104181
