    I am pleased to sign into law today H.R. 11886, the Veterans' Disability Compensation and Survivors' Benefits Act of 1978, and H.R. 12028, the Veterans' Housing Benefits Act of 1978.
Our Nation owes no greater responsibility or debt of gratitude than to the men and women who served their country in battle and came back with disabling injuries. Because of that debt, we have gladly provided compensation payments.
However, in the last year, inflation has reduced the value of that compensation, and, unlike social security or other programs, there is no automatic inflation adjustment. H.R. 11886 will increase these payments by 7.3 percent, so that beneficiaries do not unfairly bear the brunt of inflation.
Inflation has also driven up the cost of housing, as most of us know. H.R. 12028 will expand the opportunities for our veterans, especially the younger, Vietnam era veterans who are entering a very expensive housing market for the first time.
This bill will increase the maximum home loan guarantee to a more realistic level, expand the VA home loan program to purchasing condominiums and mobile homes, and encourage energy-saving home improvements. This bill will also increase the maximum grant for specially adapted housing for the severely disabled to $30,000.
These two bills will go far to improve and modernize veterans benefit programs that are critical to the well-being of those who have bravely served our Nation.
As I sign these two bills today, I am also looking forward to signing soon the Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978.
