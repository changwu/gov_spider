    Minneapolis, MN â€” Today, the Amy for America presidential campaign announced it raised over $5.2 million in just seven weeks. Klobuchar's contributions, combined with the over $3 million she raised last year, bring her end of the quarter total to over $8 million with $7 million cash on hand.
The Amy for America campaign has been focused on connecting with voters and grassroots donors across the country, engaging nearly 100,000 new supporters online in the first seven weeks of the campaign. Klobuchar's average online grassroots contribution was $40 and 85 percent of all donors gave less than $100.
On the day she announced her candidacy for president, Klobuchar said her campaign would be a "homegrown one." In the last seven weeks, Klobuchar has reinforced that point -- she's met with thousands of voters across ten states, participated in town halls, answered hundreds of questions about the issues facing our country and shared her plans to create an optimistic economic agenda that will move America forward.
