    WASHINGTON -- Bernie 2020 announced today that it will be the first major party presidential campaign in history to have a unionized workforce. In the past week, a majority of the campaign's bargaining unit employees designated the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 to represent them as their exclusive bargaining representative.
"Bernie Sanders is the most pro-union candidate in the field, he'll be the most pro-union president in the White House and we're honored that his campaign will be the first to have a unionized workforce," said Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir.
The campaign recognized a card check system to indicate support for the union and did not require an election. This is the model Sen. Sanders has advocated for decades to be applied to unionizing efforts everywhere.
