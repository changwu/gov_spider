Another study projected that Medicare and Medicaid spending to care for those with Alzheimer's would reach $800 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, by mid-century. Current spending is $130 billion annually. In terms of costs, the study suggests actual spending of $1.1 trillion through 2050 with the balance of the $20 trillion cost involving lost wages and worker productivity.
The industry-funded study also suggested that a drug that could delay the onset of Alzheimer's by five years could cut government spending by half in 2050.
