- CHYRON: "The economy is emerging as the overriding issue in the 2008 presidential race, and Romney's message on the subject is stronger..."
- Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes: "The Economy Is Emerging As The Overriding Issue In The 2008 Presidential Race, And Romney's Message On The Subject Is Stronger..." "Mitt Romney had a light home field advantage in the Michigan primary since he grew up in Detroit and his dad was a three-term governor. But that's not why he won. Romney defeated John McCain because the economy is emerging as the overriding issue in the 2008 presidential race, and Romney's message on the subject is stronger than McCain's. And Romney is far more comfortable and persuasive in talking about the economy." (Fred Barnes, "Romney Gets The Gold," Weekly Standard, 1/16/08)

- CHYRON: "Romney was at his best in crisis mode."
- The Oakland Press: Romney "Has The Credentials To Run The Country." "Meanwhile, Mitt Romney certainly has the credentials to run the country.

- National Review: "We Vote For Mitt Romney." "More than the other primary candidates, Romney has President Bush's virtues and avoids his flaws. His moral positions, and his instincts on taxes and foreign policy, are the same. But he is less inclined to federal activism, less tolerant of overspending, better able to defend conservative positions in debate, and more likely to demand performance from his subordinates. A winning combination, by our lights. In this most fluid and unpredictable Republican field, we vote for Mitt Romney." (Editorial, "Romney for President," National Review, 12/11/07)
