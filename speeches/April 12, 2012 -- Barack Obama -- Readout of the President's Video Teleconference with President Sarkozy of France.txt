    Continuing their close consultations on global issues of common concern, the President and French President Sarkozy held a video teleconference today to discuss Syria, Iran, and stability in the oil markets. On Syria, the President and President Sarkozy condemned the violence perpetrated by the regime against its own people and noted that the regime had yet to fully implement the agreement negotiated with Kofi Annan pursuant to the Annan plan. The two leaders called for the regime to fully implement the Annan plan, noting that the international community would judge the regime by its actions and not its words. On Iran, both leaders expressed hope that Iran would take advantage of the upcoming P5+1 talks to address the international community's concerns about the Iranian nuclear program. The President and President Sarkozy agreed to continue increasing the pressure on the Iranian regime through sanctions and other measures if Tehran remains unresponsive. Finally, the President and President Sarkozy agreed to continue their consultations about the tightness in global oil markets.
