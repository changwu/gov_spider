    During World Suicide Prevention Day, we remember the lives lost to suicide, and we commit to expanding access to meaningful crisis intervention and mental health treatment options. We commit to reaching out, listening to, and lifting up our loved ones, and we remind those struggling with despair and depression that they are not alone and that there is hope.
In the United States, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death, with one death every 12.3 minutes on average. We particularly commit to supporting our veterans, who will always be a top priority for my administration. Every day, 20 veterans tragically take their own lives. More servicemembers have died by suicide than from combat in recent years. We must do more. They are our heroes, and they deserve the world-class health care my administration has pledged to provide to them.
The tragedy of suicide leaves in its wake sorrow among families, friends, colleagues, classmates, and neighbors. While we offer comfort and solace to survivors, we take heart in knowing that in joining together, communities can prevent suicides. By openly discussing suicide, recognizing risk factors such as mental illness, trauma, substance abuse, and unemployment, and deploying help to those who need itâ€”we will find hope and prevent untimely deaths.
As a Nation, we must strive to prevent heartbreaking loss of life caused by suicides. We commit to helping our fellow Americans know the joyful life that is possible within our bountiful Nation.
