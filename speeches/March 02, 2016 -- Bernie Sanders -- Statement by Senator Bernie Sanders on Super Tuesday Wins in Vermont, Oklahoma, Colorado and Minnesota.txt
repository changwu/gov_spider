    
BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday issued the following statement after winning primaries and caucuses in Vermont, Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota:
"The political revolution has begun.
"Ten months ago, when our campaign started, not many people thought we would get this far or do this well. Not many people outside of Vermont even knew who I was. That was then. 
"Tonight, voters in Colorado, Oklahoma and Minnesota have joined the people of Vermont in showing America that a political revolution is spreading across our country, that people want to take on the billionaire class and make our government work for all Americans and not just the top 1 percent.
"Today, we head to Maine and Michigan. Our campaign is just getting started. We're going all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia and beyond.
"Tomorrow, I look forward to a contest this fall between democracy and demagoguery, between ordinary Americans and the oligarchs. I look forward to the chance for our people-powered campaign to show Donald Trump that the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just billionaire bullies."
