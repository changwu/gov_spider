    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Sec. 4 of the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Amendments of 1979 (P.L. 96-181; 21 U.S.C. 1117), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Drug Policy Office of the Domestic Policy Staff.
This report reflects the nature and accomplishments of the drug abuse policy coordination function and highlights the major activities and accomplishments of the Administration in reducing the effects of drug abuse in the United States. As we move forward in the decade of the 1980's, I pledge my continued support to our fight against drug abuse.
