    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Congressman Herbert Bateman.
For more than 30 years, Herb Bateman served the people of Virginia with honor and distinction. As a veteran of the Air Force and a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, he worked to support our Armed Forces and was a strong advocate of fiscal discipline and a balanced budget.
Herb Bateman was a fine man and dedicated public servant who will be missed by many. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Laura, their family, and their friends.
