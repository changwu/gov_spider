In North Carolina and other primary states, voters who realize this have a decision to make. If they want to cast an affirmative vote for a GOP candidate, one who has a record of results that represent their party's historic values, we recommend John Kasich.
The Ohio governor's campaign has been largely positive thus far, which of course has resulted in it getting lost in the slapfight that the GOP primary has become. But Kasich's message – and his record as governor and congressman – is both clear and refreshing: It's possible to lead with conservative principles, work across the aisle, balance budgets and be attentive to all citizens.
He is a fiscal hawk who helped close a budget shortfall in Ohio, but he also allowed for the expansion of Medicaid in his state and has shown an openness to offering undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. N.C. voters might recognize that kind of conservative; Kasich is the Eisenhower Republican we thought we were getting as governor four years ago.

[If] you want a candidate whose pragmatic conservatism echoes the GOP in its better days, we recommend John Kasich. He is the best of the candidates to move the party forward.
