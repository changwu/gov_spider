My dear Miss Nelson:
Public Health Nursing in the United States has become one of the most potent forces for raising the level of health and efficiency of the people. It not only brings the boon of trained nursing service to even the humblest homes, but is a bulwark against neglect and suffering and a powerful influence in constructively promoting the public health. I am interested to learn of the plans of the National Organization for Public Health Nursing to increase its service by broadening its membership. Its efforts and objectives commend themselves to all citizens. I wish you the fullest measure of success in your current undertaking and your continued program for improving the health of the people.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
