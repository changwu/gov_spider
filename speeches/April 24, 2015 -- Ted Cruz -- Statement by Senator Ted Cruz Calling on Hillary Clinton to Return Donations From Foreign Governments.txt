    HOUSTON, Texas â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement calling for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to return all donations made by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation:
"Recent polls indicate that a majority of the American people do not trust Hillary Clinton. The recent revelations about previously undisclosed contributions to the Clinton Foundation only create more doubt about whether the former Secretary of State can be trusted.
"The Clinton Foundation collected tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments including donors who had business interests with the State Department while Clinton was Secretary. She made decisions in that capacity that likely benefited the same people who were giving large donations to the foundation.
"At the very least, these revelations present a clear conflict of interest. I call on Hillary Clinton to return the donations from foreign governments. Until she does, how can the American people trust her with another position of power?"
