    Today, a single district judge in California reimposed a nationwide injunction halting the implementation of important rules that reform our broken asylum system â€” after the Ninth Circuit previously struck down this exact injunction. The Attorney General has recently explained the grave threat such injunctions pose to our Constitutional order. Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction. This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law. We previously asked the Supreme Court to set aside the district court's injunction in its entirety, our request remains pending with the Court, and we look forward to it acting on our request.
