    Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted the leadership of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) in the Oval Office to discuss critical issues of shared importance, including combating anti-Asian hate, the American Jobs Plan, immigration and education policies.
The President highlighted his recent Statement of Administration Policy that condemns in the strongest possible terms the increasing acts of anti-Asian bias, harassment and violence, and conveyed his ongoing support of the legislation introduced by Senator Mazie Hirono and Congresswoman Grace Meng, which moved forward in the Senate yesterday with bipartisan support.
The President and Vice President shared their vision in the American Jobs Plan to invest in shared CAPAC infrastructure priorities, including care economy infrastructure and digital infrastructure.
The President expressed his commitment to diversity throughout the Administration, including the recent appointment of Erika L. Moritsugu as Deputy Assistant to the President and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Senior Liaison, where she will be a vital voice to advance the President and the Administration's priorities.
This meeting underscores the long-term partnership between President Biden, Vice President Harris, and CAPAC on crucial issues, and the Administration's continued attention to their legislative goals and priorities.
