    Today, I have signed into law S. 3508, the "Save Our Seas Act of 2018" (the "Act"). The Act reauthorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program for 5 years, promotes increased safety in the maritime industry, and promotes interagency and international action to reduce the amount of marine debris.
The Act, however, raises constitutional concerns. Sections 206(b), 208(a)(1), and 216 of the Act purport to dictate the position of the United States in external foreign affairs, and section 208(a)(2) of the Act purports to require an update to certain congressional committees on the progress of international negotiations. My Administration will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs, and with the President's constitutional authority to withhold information protected by executive privilege, the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations.
