    Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President & Director of the Gender Policy Council, and Aviva Aron-Dine, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman, Senate Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic, and Senator Alice Mann to celebrate Minnesota becoming the twelfth state, along with the District of Columbia, to pass paid family and medical leave legislation.
Minnesota's historic legislation will strengthen the state's economy and ensure that workers in the state can take the time they need to recover from a serious illness, care for a sick family member, or welcome a new child without losing a paycheck. The Biden-Harris Administration applauds states that have made significant progress in advancing paid leave and continues to support a national paid family and medical leave program for families across the country.
In the meeting, White House officials and Minnesota elected leaders discussed the state's paid family and medical leave legislation, the significance of states across the country passing similar measures, and the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to ensuring access to paid leave for all working families. White House officials congratulated Minnesota elected officials on their historic legislative session in 2023, which also delivered important gains in climate and clean energy, infrastructure, health care, paid sick leave, free school meals, and more.
