    In web video, Hillary talks about her plan to offer health care to 9 million uninsured children across the country
In a new video released on her web site, Hillary Clinton details her legislation announced today aimed at providing all children with access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage. The "HillCast" is part of a regular series of web broadcasts Senator Clinton will deliver over the coming months on important issues facing Americans.
"Making health care accessible and affordable for all children will keep kids healthy, save lives, control costs, and end heartache and worry for so many parents," Clinton said today. "This plan is practical and fiscally responsible -- it will honor our values and prevent kids from needing more costly healthcare in the future."
Six million children are already eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) but not enrolled. Clinton's legislation includes incentives for states to expand children's healthcare to those who are not eligible, and identify and enroll uninsured kids that already qualify for coverage.
The Children's Health First Act allows States to expand children's health coverage to families up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level (which is $70,000 for a family of three) through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and receive increased Federal payments.
This legislation offers a new affordable coverage option for both families and employers by allowing them the opportunity to buy health insurance coverage through SCHIP. And it provides new incentives to strengthen and protect employer-sponsored coverage, something more than 50 percent of children enjoy today.
