    President George W. Bush today announced his intention to nominate Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, to be one of two Senate representatives to the 55th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
There are two congressional representatives who participate in the proceedings of the U.N. General Assembly. These positions alternate every two years between the House of Representatives and the Senate. At this time, Senator Joseph Biden holds one of the Senate positions, and Senator Frist has been nominated to fill the position vacated by former Senator Rod Grams.
