    Dole/Kemp Press Secretary Nelson Warfield released the following statement today:
"Bill Clinton followed his typical rally recipe today: begin with a known Dole policy, water it down with liberal rhetoric, re-heat, and serve as your own initiative,
"On May 28, in Aurora, Colorado, Bob Dole said as President, he 'will propose legislation requiring drug testing at every stage of the federal criminal justice system, with appropriate sanctions for those who fail these tests.' Bill Clinton's remarks today were simply a shameless attempt to cover his failed liberal drug policy."

The President's 1993 and '94 presidential papers reveal 24 references to illegal drugs in a total of 3,370 presidential statement, addresses and interviews.

Establishing Tougher Penalties?
Federal drug prosecutions dropped 15% in the first two years of the Clinton Administration.
Then Drug Policy Director Lee Brown called "the policies of the new U.S. Attorneys who demphasized prosecution of small-scale drug offenders," which account for the decline, "consistent with DOJ policy."
