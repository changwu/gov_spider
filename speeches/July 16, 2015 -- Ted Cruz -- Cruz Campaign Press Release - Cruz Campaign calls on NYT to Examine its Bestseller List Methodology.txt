    HOUSTON, Texas — Cruz national spokesman Rick Tyler released the following statement regarding U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's book A Time for Truth ranking #7 on the most recent New York Times bestseller list:
"What's transpired at the New York Times in the last two weeks raises troubling questions that should concern any author. The Times' position has been disputed by a major publishing house, and by the two largest booksellers in the nation (Amazon and Barnes & Noble.) The New York Times has a responsibility to authors and readers to have the Public Editor Margaret Sullivan examine its methodology — and we join others in calling for the Times to do just that."
