    I applaud the strong, bipartisan majority of Senators who today confirmed Sylvia Mathews Burwell as America's next Secretary of Health and Human Services. Sylvia is a proven manager who knows how to deliver results, and over her career, she has built deep relationships with Democrats and Republicans alike. I'm confident Sylvia's unparalleled experience will serve her well in her new role as she works to ensure the safety of our food and drug supply, protect our Nation from outbreaks or bioterror attacks, keep America at the forefront of medical research, and make sure every American has access to quality, affordable healthcare.
