ST. LOUIS, Missouri — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted today a remarkable 1,500-plus supporters and undecided voters to an outdoor town hall meeting held in Missouri.
Dr. Paul's campus town hall meeting was held at 12:00 p.m. CST on the Carnahan Quadrangle — The South Quad at the University of Missouri, located on Missouri Avenue in Columbia, MO 65211. The 12-term Congressman from Texas spoke to the crowd on issues ranging from maintaining the enduring ties that bind economic and civil liberties, the wrongheaded Washington policy of weakening the U.S. dollar through Federal Reserve activism, and elements of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint that if enacted will pull America out of its longstanding economic doldrums.
The Mizzou event occurred on the heels of last night's University of Illinois campus town hall meeting that drew an incredible 4,600-plus supporters and undecided voters. Both events were organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP), an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign. Since 'Youth for Ron Paul' launched in September 2011, students nationwide have organized 583 chapters and recruited more than 46,000 people.
