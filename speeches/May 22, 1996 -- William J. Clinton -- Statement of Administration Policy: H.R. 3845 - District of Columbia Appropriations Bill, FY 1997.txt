This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R. 3845, the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, FY 1997, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.
The Administration appreciates the Committee's action to adopt most of the Control Board's recommendations for the District's 1997 budget The $5.1 billion FY 1997 budget for the District that was forwarded to the Congress represents a consensus budget agreed to by the District Council, the Mayor, and the Control Board. The Administration supports the Committee's efforts to reach consensus on the District's budget
The Administration would strongly oppose an amendment, if offered, to reduce funding provided by the bill by 1.9 percent The budget that was coordinated with the District Council, the Mayor, and the Control Board represents a goodfaifh effort toward balancing the District's budget over a four-year period, as required by law.
The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill's allocation for Federal funding does not include the $52 million increase in the Federal contribution to the pension payment proposed in the President's FY 1997 request The $52 million requested increase is intended to begin to address the District's $5 billion unfunded pension liability. The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to develop a solution to address the District's single largest financial obligation.
The Administration strongly opposes the abortion language of the Committee bill, which would prohibit the use of both Federal and District funds to pay for abortions except in those cases where the life of the mother is endangered or in situations of rape or incest The Administration continues to view this prohibition on the use of local funds as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the District and would support an amendment, if offered, to strike this prohibition.
