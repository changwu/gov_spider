    Mike Bloomberg 2020 shares our current president's "greatest" hits
NEW YORK — On Presidents Day, we are meant to honor the American presidency and the steadfast leadership and integrity of those who've held the office. This nation has a rich history of presidents who respected the power, decorum, and integrity of their office. Unfortunately, that rich history ended the day Trump became president. There isn't much cause to celebrate the current president, but there are many reasons we shouldn't. The Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign today celebrated our 45th President by releasing our 10 favorite ads that tell the truth about his presidency.
Here's the countdown:

Trump attacks our heroic men and women in uniform, calling them a bunch of "dopes and babies."
Trump bullies anyone who doesn't agree with him at rallies, from the White House, in interviews, on Twitter, and even on the international stage.
Trump has repeatedly vilified the Latino community, promoting hate and discrimination.
Trump is afraid to stand up to the NRA, putting our nation's children and families at risk every day.
Trump constantly lies about his failures...
Whether it's the economy (and his personal wealth)
Social security,
Or drug prices,
And, especially when he's feeling insecure.
We all know there's only one job Trump is qualified for: running a golf course.

Our nation today is divided by an angry, out of control president who doesn't have what it takes to lead — and defeating him in November must be our priority. It's time to dump this president: Together we can defeat Trump, and this is how we win. As president, Mike will bring decency, respect, and unity back to the White House, and make Presidents Day great again.
