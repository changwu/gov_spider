    REPORTER. Mr. President, when will you veto this bill which would extend the Federal oil price controls?
THE PRESIDENT. It depends on whether or not the Democratic leadership can produce a compromise which we had agreed to. I understand that they have not been able to get a sufficient number of Democrats to agree with them on a compromise proposal. Sometime within the time limit--I will have no alternative since I have gone more than halfway and they can't produce, under the circumstances, so, sometime within the 10-day period I will have to veto it.
Q. What is your view right now about the proposition of sending American technicians to aid in maintaining peace in the Mideast?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, the sending of American civilians on a volunteer basis in a zone that is covered by the United Nations is the best insurance for peace. It is the best insurance against any oil embargo. The limited number, no more than 200, is a good investment in peace as far as the United States is concerned.
Q. What is your position on the agricultural shipments? Secretary Butz had some statements today.
THE PRESIDENT. I believe that if the crop report of September 11 is reasonably favorable, that it is in the best interest of the United States to make additional sales of grain to overseas customers. We will have to wait and see how the grain report in wheat, corn, and other feed grains shows. But if it is encouraging, I think it is in the best interest of the United States to use this great commodity for many, many beneficial purposes as far as the United States is concerned. Thank you very much, everybody.
