    Today marks the 124th anniversary of Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is home to more than half of the world's geysers, America's largest herds of elk and bison, and one of the great places on the Earth where we teach our children the mysteries of nature.
Conservation history was made 124 years ago today, when Yellowstone was designated the world's first national park. It is a tribute to the wisdom of the American people that we are willing to set aside and preserve some wild places. Yellowstone was entrusted to our care by our ancestors who had a vision. We now have a responsibility to care for Yellowstone so that our children and their children can experience the wonder of nature and the wisdom of our ancestors.
