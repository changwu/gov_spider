    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I am concerned that Presidential appointees and other key policy executives receive authoritative briefings as soon as possible on those major laws and policies which affect the way in which they do their jobs. Illustratively, they need to know about budgetary and civil service laws, our policies on ethics and conflict-of-interest, the privacy and freedom of information acts, and similar statutes. They also need to be thoroughly acquainted with our policies in working with Congress and the media.
I have asked the U.S. Civil Service Commission, the Office of Management and Budget and the Presidential Personnel Office to develop a series of briefings for this purpose. You will soon be receiving from the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission a schedule of briefing meetings together with a request that you designate those individuals you wish to participate in each session. I have asked that these meetings be scheduled outside the regular working day so that it will be possible to have the full participation of your associates in this program. There is, in my judgment, nothing more important to successful government operations than having a well-informed leadership.
