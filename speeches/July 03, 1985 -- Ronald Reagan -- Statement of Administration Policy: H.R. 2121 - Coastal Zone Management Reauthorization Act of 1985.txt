    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Mikulski (D) Maryland and 30 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2121 because it would authorize Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) grant programs for six years (fiscal years 1986-1991), in contrast with the 1986 Budget which proposed termination of the programs.
H.R. 2121 is also objectionable because it would: (1) impose unnecessarily complex procedural requirements for designating estuarine sanctuaries under the existing Section 315 CZMA grant program, for which the Administration requested appropriations in the 1986 Budget, and (2) require the Secretary of Commerce to develop guidelines for research within estuarine areas, instead of relying on the States to develop guidelines and long-term management plans suitable for their particular estuarine sanctuaries.
