    I congratulate the Governors and legislatures of the eight States that border the Great Lakes on their conclusion of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. Made in the spirit of cooperative conservation, this compact is the result of many years of close coordination and consensus building that resulted in the compact's approval by the eight Great Lakes States and two Canadian Provinces.
The Great Lakes are a national treasure. They were vital to the exploration of this continent and have long supported commerce. Today, more than 33 million people live in the States and Provinces bordering the lakes, and the lakes provide an efficient means to transport food and other commodities destined for global markets. The Great Lakes provide a wide variety of recreational opportunities and serve as a source of drinking water for more than 30 million people.
The compact will ensure sustainable use and responsible management of waters from the Great Lakes Basin and preserve the Great Lakes for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.
I strongly urge Congress to provide rapid approval of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact.
