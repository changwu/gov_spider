    The United States is pleased that the legitimately elected Government of Mauritania has maintained authority and is restoring the rule of law in that country. We oppose attempts by rogue elements to change governments through extra-constitutional or violent means. We deeply regret the loss of life and dislocation suffered during the recent violence, and hope that further violence will be avoided.
Mauritania is a valued bilateral partner, and the United States remains committed to supporting the Mauritanian people's efforts to build and sustain a vibrant civilian-led democracy. We look forward to continuing our joint efforts to promote development, alleviate poverty, fight global terrorism, and advocate for peace in the Middle East.
