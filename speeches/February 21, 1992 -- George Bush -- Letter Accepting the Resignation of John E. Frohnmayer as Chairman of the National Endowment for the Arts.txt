    Dear John:
I received your letter of resignation today and, with sincere thanks and appreciation for your service, I accept your resignation effective May 1.
I recall your coming to talk to me about this on October 24. At that time you told me you wanted to step aside. I told you then that I certainly understood your reasons for desiring to return to private life.
Your job is one of the most difficult in government. You have worked hard for freedom of expression; and yet, at times, as you have ruled against certain grants that you felt were beyond the bounds of common decency, you have been criticized.
I thank you for the integrity and commitment that you have brought to the National Endowment for the Arts.
No two people can agree in every instance on every grant or indeed on what is good art; in fact some of the art funded by the NEA does not have my enthusiastic approval. I expect some did not have yours, but this should not obscure the overall work of the NEA nor your contribution to it.
I thank you and wish you and your family well for a very bright future.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Mr. President:
Last October I told you of my desire to return to private life. Accordingly, I submit my resignation effective May 1, 1992.
I have appreciated the opportunity to serve you and the arts; you know how much your personal support has meant to me during these difficult times. You and your administration have accomplished a great deal and I'm sure the best is yet to come.
Sincerely,
John E. Frohnmayer
