    The distribution tables released today by the U.S. Department of the Treasury confirm that President Bush's tax plan provides the most help to low and modest income Americans. Under the President's plan, individuals making between $30,000 and $40,000 a year pay only 2.5 percent of current taxes and would receive a 38 percent reduction in their tax burden. Individuals making more than $200,000 pay 43 percent of the taxes and would see their tax burden lowered by 8.7 percent. President Bush's plan is fair, responsible and will help those who need it most.
