    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ford (D) MI and 67 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 2884.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2884 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). OMB's preliminary estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
