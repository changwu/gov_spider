    The United States offers its sincere condolences on the passing of Iraqi statesman and former president, Jalal Talabani. We remember him as a true patriot and partner who was instrumental in transitioning Iraq from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein to the constitutional democracy it is today. We share our deepest sympathies with President Talabani's family, his friends, and the people of the Republic of Iraq during this time of mourning.
