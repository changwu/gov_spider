    Housing and Urban Development Secretary-designate Marcia Fudge met virtually with the National American Indian Council to discuss the critical housing needs of indigenous communities and ways in which the Biden-Harris Administration can work in partnership with Tribal Nations on a government-to-government basis. President-elect Biden has committed to ensuring consistent and robust meaningful consultation with Tribal Nations across the White House and federal agencies.
Secretary-designate Fudge and meeting participants discussed the unique needs of the Native American community and the urgent need to work together to provide as much support to the community as possible. Participants stressed the importance of reauthorizing The Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) and how it is critical to ensuring that Native American communities have the funding for adequate, safe housing and communities. The organizations also stressed that after years of inadequate funding, they would like to see an increase in resources through programs such as the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) which many in the community rely on.
The participants and Secretary-designate Fudge also discussed additional engagement and resources that would support the Native American community including the need for improved training and technical assistance, the establishment of a HUD tribal advisory committee and elevating tribal housing priorities within the Department. Secretary-designate Fudge shared with the groups that she is looking forward to visiting Native American communities if she is confirmed and ensured participants there would be an open line of communication between the Council and HUD.
