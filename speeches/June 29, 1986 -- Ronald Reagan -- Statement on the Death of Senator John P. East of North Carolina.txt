    John East was a true patriot. He loved his country and was motivated by a deep sense of duty to his fellow man. A United States Marine, an attorney, an instructor of college-level English, and a United States Senator, John East dedicated his life to serving his fellow citizen. Never flamboyant or interested in personal acclaim, he was a quiet and effective legislator who never wavered in his belief in principle and in his determination to keep our country strong. He cared about the people of North Carolina in a special way and was immensely proud of being chosen to represent them in Washington. Even in the face of adversity, John East put his duty and his constituents ahead of his personal comfort, earning him the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The people have lost a great Senator, and Nancy and I have lost a valued and trusted friend. We extend our deep sympathy to Priscilla and the East family.
