    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Savage (D) Illinois and 39 others)
The administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 2686 and, if presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend its disapproval.
H.R. 2686 would authorize appropriations of $276 million for Economic Development Administration (EDA) and $162.4 million for Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) programs in each of fiscal years 1988-1990. The administration has proposed to terminate both the EDA and ARC programs, because they have been ineffective in stimulating economic development while adding to the Federal deficit. The administration believes that local economic development is best fostered through sound economic growth, regulatory relief, fiscal constraint, and funding by local governments when appropriate.
