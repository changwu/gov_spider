I spoke at length yesterday to Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein Chabad of Poway where I extended my warmest condolences to him and all affected by the shooting in California. What a great guy. He had a least one finger blown off and all he wanted to do is help others. Very special!Retweets: 19910Favorites: 106795

The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G. who are illegally using the State's legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization & others. It must get its act together quickly stop the internal fighting & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!Retweets: 20232Favorites: 80853

....People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes even oppression of sorts. They didn't even put up a fight against SALT - could have won. So much litigation. The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!Retweets: 17980Favorites: 77913

I'll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune. But the members love Trump. They look at our record economy tax & reg cuts military etc. WIN!Retweets: 24723Favorites: 114625

The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard. Funny I'm only here because of Biden & Obama. They didn't do the job and now you have Trump who is getting it done - big time!Retweets: 26774Favorites: 113665

Sleepy Joe Biden is having his first rally in the Great State of Pennsylvania. He obviously doesn't know that Pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history with lowest unemployment EVER a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead) & great future!........Retweets: 18189Favorites: 76741

Bob Mueller was a great HERO to the Radical Left Democrats. Now that the Mueller Report is finished with a finding of NO COLLUSION & NO OBSTRUCTION (based on a review of Report by our highly respected A.G.) the Dems are going around saying 'Bob who sorry don't know the man.'Retweets: 22223Favorites: 86678

The New York Times has apologized for the terrible Anti-Semitic Cartoon but they haven't apologized to me for this or all of the Fake and Corrupt news they print on a daily basis. They have reached the lowest level of 'journalism' and certainly a low point in @nytimes history!Retweets: 21583Favorites: 82797

Pittsburgh jobless rate hits lowest point since the early 1970s (maybe even better than that) and Sleepy Joe just had his first rally there. Fact is every economic aspect of our Country is the best it has ever been! https://t.co/kWriC0DIuWRetweets: 21286Favorites: 79418
