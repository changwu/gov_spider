    I applaud the House of Representatives for voting again this week in support of greater transparency and accountability in Government. H.R. 1000 [H. Res. 1000] * would shine a brighter light on earmarks by requiring disclosure of the sponsors of each provision. This reform would help improve the legislative process by making sure both lawmakers and the public are better informed before Congress votes to spend the taxpayers' money.
