    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/8/91)(House)(Owens (D) NY)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 2720. The bill extends through FY 1992 the appropriations authorizations for the child abuse prevention, adoption opportunities, and family violence prevention programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Administration will work in the Senate for passage of its legislation, the "Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1991," which was transmitted to Congress on April 17, 1991. That bill would extend the appropriations authorizations through FY 1994, with several amendments to improve the programs.
