Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated 'I believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.' This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on 'super' late term abortion. Unforgivable!Retweets: 34373Favorites: 153042

Ed Gillespie who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election he wins by 20 points!Retweets: 23449Favorites: 108821

Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long straight & putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back & will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack & Tiger like each other.Retweets: 24311Favorites: 153686
