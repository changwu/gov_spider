    Mitt Romney's Florida campaign today announced the names of the Social Conservatives Statewide Steering Committe. Each member has been an active voice in state politics and an advocate for conservative causes and issue campaigns. The Romney campaign will utilize this coalition to perform voter outreach and coalition building for Get Out the Vote efforts.
"Mitt Romney is pro-life and is a true conservative on issues of family and faith," said State Co-Chair Pat Neal, former State Senator and former Chair of the Board of the Christian Coalition of Florida. "The members of this committee are tired of the liberal policies of the Obama Administration and are confident that Governor Romney will stand up for the values that have made our country strong and will appoint judges that respect the Constitution and the rule of law."
"I am honored by the support of these important Florida leaders," said Mitt Romney. "Like them, I believe that America is great because of the faith of our founders and the strength of our families, and we must do everything that we can to preserve both."
Titles other than their official Romney designations are used for identification purposes only.
