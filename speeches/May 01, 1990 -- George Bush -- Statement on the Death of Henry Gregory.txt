    Barbara and I are deeply saddened by the death of Rev. Henry Gregory. As minister of the Shiloh Baptist Church of Washington, Reverend Gregory reached out to help those in need. He saw the church as a promoter of "activities that are beneficial to the interests of those without work, food, shelter, or hope," and "an advocate for people who don't have a voice." His leadership led to the construction of the church's Family Life Center, which provides both spiritual and physical help to those coping with hardships of inner-city life. Barbara and I well remember our visits with Reverend Gregory at the Vice President's house and the White House and attending services at his church. We commend his spiritual leadership and are proud to have known him. He was an outstanding leader, and he will be missed. Our condolences go out to his wife and children, and we share the loss with his parishioners and the community he loved and served so well.
