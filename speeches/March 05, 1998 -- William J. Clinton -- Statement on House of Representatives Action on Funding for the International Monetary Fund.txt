    I want to congratulate members of both parties in the House Banking Committee who have voted to give the International Monetary Fund the resources it needs to deal with the risks to financial stability around the world. This bipartisan legislation will help ensure that the IMF has the funds it needs to protect American jobs and exports.
The American economy continues to demonstrate its remarkable strength, and we must do everything we can to keep it on a path of steady growth. That is why we will work to build broad bipartisan support for this legislation as it moves forward in Congress. It is vital that the Congress move as quickly as possible to support full funding for the IMF.
