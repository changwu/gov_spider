The law has crippled community banks and increased the cost of lending for too many Americans.
We need to repeal Dodd-Frank and focus on stopping out-of-control regulators by enacting a National Regulatory Budget, which will cap — and reduce — the amount that regulations can cost the economy per year.
I support pro-growth, 21st century economic policies to make America competitive, not burdensome laws like Dodd-Frank that empower the federal government at the expense of innovation and economic growth.
