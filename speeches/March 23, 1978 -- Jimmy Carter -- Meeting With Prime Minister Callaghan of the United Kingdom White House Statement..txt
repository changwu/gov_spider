    The British Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. James Callaghan, M.P., and the President met at the White House this morning, beginning at 11 a.m. and continuing through a working lunch. The Prime Minister is in Washington at the invitation of President Carter. He arrived yesterday afternoon and will remain in Washington for several days in a private capacity, visiting his daughter and family (Mrs. Peter Jay, wife of the British Ambassador). Mrs. Callaghan accompanied him.
The Prime Minister's trip here is in the context of our frequent and close consultations with the United States traditional friends and allies, particularly on economic and security issues affecting our mutual well-being. As you know, Danish Prime Minister Jorgensen was recently here in his capacity as EC Council President, and Mr. Callaghan's visit will be followed by the North Atlantic Council summit meeting here in May, Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda's visit later this spring, and another economic summit meeting in the coming months.
The meeting this morning was characterized by a very warm and friendly atmosphere, as befits the third meeting of the two leaders since President Carter took office last year. The Prime Minister and the President discussed a number of issues, including the international economic situation, at some length. They exchanged ideas and agreed to continue to be in close communication.
