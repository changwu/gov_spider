    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 8178, the Federal District Court Organization Act of 1980. This legislation helps to ensure that the organizational structure of the Federal courts will reflect the needs and conditions of the areas they serve. To this end, the act creates a new place of holding court in Santa Anna, Calif., and alters somewhat the geographical boundaries of Federal courts in Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas.
The organizational structure of the Federal courts has an impact on the overall effectiveness of our justice system. In the past, the organization of the district courts has tended to evolve in response to local pressures rather than to consideration of the long-term needs and goals of the judicial system as a whole. I commend Congress for processing district court legislation in a comprehensive manner. Congressman Robert Kastenmeier, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice, deserves special recognition for developing this approach.
