Potus began with a hello and said he wouldn't be able to do many questions with 600 Olympians outside.
He took 2: on sanctions and abortion.
He began prepared remarks, using a promoter, stressing deficit reduction in his tenure.
"It's gone down both years that I've been here period."
He cited the ACÁ, vaccine shots and other actions.
"We recovered faster than projected"
He tore into MAGA, and this time mentioned Rick Scott by name when speaking about his tax plans.
"It's a maga agenda alright"
"It's extreme as most maga things are"
He brought up $350b deficit reduction in his first year.
"I don't want to hear Republicans talk about deficits and their ultra maga agenda," he said.
He wouldn't take a shouted question from your pooler on maga / the Ohio primary results.
A few times he said "mega" and corrected himself, saying he should pronounce it right.
