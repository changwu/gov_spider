CHARLESTON, SC - Tim Scott kicked off this week with a series of town halls across South Carolina that each drew hundreds of voters. Scott's statewide swing included stops in Charleston, Lexington, and Greenville before he spoke at Jeff Duncan's 12th Annual Faith and Freedom BBQ in Anderson.
During the events, Tim rolled out his new 'Empower Parents Plan,' which outlines key policy points to defend America's children, empower parents, and protect kids online.
Tim will continue to share his 'Empower Parents Plan' in Iowa this week alongside Congressman Randy Feenstra and Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks.
