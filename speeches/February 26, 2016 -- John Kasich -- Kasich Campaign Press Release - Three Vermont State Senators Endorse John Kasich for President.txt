    Today, three state senators from Vermont—Peg Flory (R-Rutland), Kevin Mullin (R-Rutland), and Rich Westman (R-Lamoille)— endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America Leadership Team.
"Among all the mudslinging and arguing, one candidate has stood above the fray, put solutions first and listened to the American people," said Flory. "That candidate is John Kasich. He isn't just the leader we want, he is the leader our country needs."

Peg Flory was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1999-2010 and has served in the state Senate since 2011. She is the chair of the Senate Committee on Institutions.
In a letter to the Burlington Free Press, Mullin wrote, "Our country sorely needs a leader ? an adult in the room! ? who knows how to work with others to get things done. Someone with experience under his belt and warmth in his heart. Someone who doesn't just talk about fixing the economy, but has actually done it. That's why I am proud to support Gov. John Kasich for president."

Kevin Mullin was elected in 2003 to the state Senate. He is the chair of the Senate Committee on Economic Development, Housing and General Affairs.
Said Westman, "We can expect results from John Kasich. As governor, he balanced the budget and cut taxes to empower Ohioans to save and plan for their future. I trust that if we send John Kasich to the White House, he will lead from day one and get things done."

Westman was elected in 2011. He was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1983-2009.
Responding to these key endorsements, Kasich said, "Our momentum is growing in Vermont. I appreciate the support from these leaders in the General Assembly as we work to spread a positive and solutions-driven message across the state."
