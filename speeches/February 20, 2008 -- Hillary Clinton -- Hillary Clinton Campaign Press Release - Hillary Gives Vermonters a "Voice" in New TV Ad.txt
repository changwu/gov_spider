    Campaign Hits the Airwaves Statewide with First Green Mountain State Ad
The Clinton campaign launched a new television ad in Vermont today highlighting Hillary Clinton's commitment to giving a voice to American families struggling in our troubled economy to obtain quality, affordable health care, invest in alternative energy and green jobs, realize the dream of home ownership, and give their children the future they deserve.
"Hillary Clinton is not only qualified and experienced, but she also represents real change for Vermonters," said Former Governor Madeleine Kunin. "Throughout her 35 year career advocating on behalf of working families, Hillary has spoken out for Americans without a voice. As President, Hillary will fight for real solutions to the problems facing Vermonters.
The new 30-second spot, titled "Vermont Voice," highlights Hillary Clinton's promise to continue her 35-year record of delivering real change that improves the daily lives of working Americans - giving a voice to children without health care, troops without body armor, and families facing foreclosures.
A complete transcript of "Vermont Voice" is included below. The TV ad can be viewed online here.
