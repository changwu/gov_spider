"I am proud to give my whole-hearted support to a great leader, who should be -- and will be -- the next President of the United States: Bob Dole," said Governor Allen. "Bob Dole's character, principles, and effective conservative leadership personify what is good about America. His hard work, self-reliance and faith in God, show that an individual from humble roots can overcome adversity and achieve great success."
"I'm proud to have the support of these distinguished Governors," said Senator Dole. "These dynamic leaders are showing us what states can do when the federal government gets out of the way. As President I will cut taxes and red tape so that Governors have the flexibility and resources to solve problems and serve their citizens."
