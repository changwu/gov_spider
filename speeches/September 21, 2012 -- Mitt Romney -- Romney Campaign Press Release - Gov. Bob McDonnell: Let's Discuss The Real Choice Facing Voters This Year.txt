    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell released the following statement on Mitt Romney's tax returns:Â 
"It's time for us to discuss the real choice facing voters this year. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are running to get America creating wealth again, while President Obama is running to redistribute wealth. We cannot afford four more years of the Obama economy, and I look forward to carrying that message to voters over these next weeks."
