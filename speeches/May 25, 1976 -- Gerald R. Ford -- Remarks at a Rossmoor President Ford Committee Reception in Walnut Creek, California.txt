    Just as we indicated out there, we got some pretty good news from Tennessee and Kentucky. I think we are ahead in Oregon and, of course, what was most satisfying--and some of the people from home would understand it-was the great shot in the arm we got in Michigan.
The thing that pleased me the most about Michigan was not only what the State did but as Winter knows, I had the privilege and honor of serving the congressional district for 25-plus years, and 16 of those years I served two counties. Those two counties went 85 percent.
There is one little voting community down in Ottawa County that the Winters know about called Overrizen. It is a crossroads, really, in a very rich agricultural area. They have got three great churches, probably three gas stations, and a school. They had 595 votes for me and 2 for my opponent. [Laughter]
But I am really getting very optimistic about the situation in California. We have had a wonderful trip out here. The crowds have been very good. The enthusiasm has really been infectious and contagious and inspiring and we are going to make a real fight of it. All of you who can help, as you have, I will be most grateful. And Betty and I will never let you down in the next 4 years.
