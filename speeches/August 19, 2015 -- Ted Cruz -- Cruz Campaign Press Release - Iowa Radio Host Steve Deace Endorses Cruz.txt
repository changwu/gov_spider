    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Iowa-based syndicated radio host and outspoken conservative activist Steve Deace endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for President. Deace, who broadcasts from Des Moines, Iowa, and appears on more than 50 stations nationwide, said Cruz is the conservative leader who can win a national campaign.


"He's what we've been waiting for: an end to the false choice between our principles and electability," said Deace. "He has proven courage of conviction, a commitment to our principles, but he's also raised the resources and put the sort of national campaign together on the ground that it takes to actually defeat the GOP establishment for the nomination. He is ready to run a national campaign. And we believe this makes him our best chance to offer the American people a real choice and not an echo for a change."
Steve Deace has been a fixture in Iowa broadcasting for more than a decade and is an influential opinion maker across the Hawkeye State. He was instrumental in the effort to recall three judges in Iowa who struck down a democratically enacted state law affirming traditional marriage. Earlier this year, he moderated the first candidate joint forum of the presidential cycle and has been a tireless advocate for liberty, fiscal responsibility, and traditional American values. He is considered by many one of the rising stars in conservative media.
"Steve Deace is unwavering in his commitment to conservative principles," said Senator Cruz. "He is a truth-teller, a courageous conservative, and a powerful voice for liberty. I am thrilled to have his support and look forward to him helping us reach millions of Americans."
