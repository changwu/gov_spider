    The President has asked Ambassador [Philip C.] Habib to return to Washington for consultations about the progress and future of his mission in the Middle East. As the President's special representative, Ambassador Habib has been engaged in talks with the leaders of Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Saudi Arabia during the last 3 weeks. The President believes that this is an appropriate moment to receive firsthand Ambassador Habib's views and to discuss with him the future of his continuing mission in the context of efforts peacefully to resolve the crisis involving events in Lebanon.
