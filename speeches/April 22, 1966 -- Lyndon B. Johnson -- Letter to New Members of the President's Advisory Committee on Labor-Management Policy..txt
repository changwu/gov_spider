    Dear Mr._____________ :
I am delighted that you have agreed to serve on the President's Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy.
This Committee has been of great help to the nation. It has focused the wisdom and experience of some of our leading citizens on the vital issues of wage and price policies, productivity, collective bargaining, and industrial relations. Through its work over the past six years, your government, the labor movement, management and the general public have benefitted from a greater understanding of the problems of a growing and dynamic free enterprise society.
Today, we are facing the basic question of how to continue our unparalleled prosperity and maintain a stable and healthy economy. The first task of the Committee will be to address itself to this most important question. With this in mind, I have asked the Committee Chairman, Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz and the Committee Vice Chairman, Secretary of Commerce John T. Connor to call the Committee together in the very near future.
I greatly appreciate your willingness to participate in the work of the Committee. Through public spirited citizens such as yourself we will find the new and creative solutions and that will move this country closer to the goal of a better life for all our people.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
