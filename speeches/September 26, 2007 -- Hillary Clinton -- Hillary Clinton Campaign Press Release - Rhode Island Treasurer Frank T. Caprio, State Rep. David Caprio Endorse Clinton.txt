    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of Rhode Island Treasurer Frank T. Caprio and his brother, State Rep. David Caprio.
"Senator Clinton offers the strength and experience to lead America at a time when we face great uncertainties at home and abroad," Treasurer Caprio said.
"We need a leader who can hit the ground running on her first day in the White House, and that leader is Hillary Clinton," Rep. Caprio said.
Elected in 2006, Treasurer Caprio has moved quickly to make Rhode Island's government more transparent and accountable, increasing the state's pool of bond underwriters, launching a new unclaimed property audit program, and re-organizing the office to deliver superior customer service.
Prior to his election as Treasurer, Caprio served 15 years in the State Legislature. In the Senate, Caprio led the effort to expand Rhode Island's affordable housing fund from $5 million to $50 million a year, and successfully fought to phase out the state's capital gains tax.
Rep. Caprio has served in the Assembly since 1999, focusing on government reform initiatives. Rep. Caprio represents District 34, which includes Narragansett and South Kingstown.
"We've received tremendous support from across Rhode Island, and I'm honored that Frank and David have joined our effort," Clinton said.
Treasurer Caprio and Rep. Caprio join Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Congressman Jim Langevin and Secretary of State Ralph Mollis in supporting Clinton, demonstrating her strong support in the Ocean State.
