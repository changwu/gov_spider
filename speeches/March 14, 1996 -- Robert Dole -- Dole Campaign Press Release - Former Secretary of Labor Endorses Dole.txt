    Today at a campaign event with Mrs. Elizabeth Dole, Former Secretary of Labor and U.S. Congresswoman Lynn Martin declared her support for Bob Dole's bid for the White House.
"Bob Dole is a proven leader--a man with the common sense conservative values America needs in a President." said Martin. "With his commitment to reigning in the federal government so that more Americans can have jobs and a secure future, reconnecting government with the values of the American people, and reasserting America's power wherever and whenever they are challenged around the world, he alone has the ability to take back the White House and complete the Republican Revolution of 1994."
"I am proud to have a distinguished Republican leader like Lynn Martin on our team," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "With Secretary Martin's help we can bring our mission of common sense conservative change to Illinois on our way to the White House in November."
Illinois will hold it's primary on March 19 and will send 69 delegates to the Republican National convention in San Diego in August.
