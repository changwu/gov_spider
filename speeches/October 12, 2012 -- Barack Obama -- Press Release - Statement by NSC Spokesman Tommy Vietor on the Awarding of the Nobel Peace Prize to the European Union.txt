    The United States congratulates the European Union on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This award recognizes Europe's commitment to the principles of democracy, freedom, and human rights, as well as its efforts to advance these values across the world. In addition, it reflects the spirit and dedication of the Europeans to coexist peacefully in a society that draws strength from the diversity of its people, its languages and its cultures. We have no stronger partner than Europe and are pleased to see it recognized for its achievements.
