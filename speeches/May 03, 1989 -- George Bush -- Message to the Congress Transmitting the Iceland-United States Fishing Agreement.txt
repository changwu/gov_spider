    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an agreement effected by exchange of notes on November 23, 1988, and January 17, 1989, extending for the period of 2 years from July 1, 1989, until July 1, 1991, and amending to conform with current U.S. law, the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Iceland Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, signed at Washington on September 21, 1984. The exchange of notes together with the present agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the meaning of section 201(c) of the act.
U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement, and, similarly, I request that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date to avoid disruption of ongoing cooperative ventures.
Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, may not be available before the current agreement is scheduled to expire, I recommend the Congress consider passage of a joint resolution.
George Bush
The White House,
May 3, 1989.
