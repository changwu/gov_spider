    In a desperate ploy to win over the Democrat Party's socialist base, Joe Biden has collaborated with Bernie Sanders to create the most radical series of policy proposals in American history. The threat of socialism has never been greater, and only President Trump will stand up to the far-left to protect American workers, maintain law and order, and defend family values. Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor, and Max Alvarez, President of Sunshine Gasoline Distributors, discussed all this and more in tonight's 'War Room Weekly' hosted by Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 Communications Director.

"Joe Biden may pretend to be a moderate, but in reality he is a Trojan horse for the radical left and their job-killing agenda," said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 Communications Director. "Only President Trump will protect our nation from the critical threat of socialism and fight to maintain the freedoms that make America the greatest country in the world."
"In every issue area, Joe Biden has surrendered to the radical ideas of the far-left, and his Biden-Bernie unity platform only solidifies his unapologetic shift towards dangerous, socialist policies," said Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "From open borders, to diminishing our nation's energy dependence, to trapping children in failing schools, a Joe Biden presidency would be a disaster for American workers, families, and minority communities."
"I came to this country to flee the oppressive, socialist regime that destroyed my native home, so I cannot bear the thought of the United States turning into another Venezuela or Cuba," said Max Alvarez, President of Sunshine Gasoline Distributors. "We have to protect our great nation from the threat of socialism, and the only way to do so is by re-electing President Trump."
