    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Packwood (R) Oregon)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1146, because the bill would authorize appropriations for 1986 for the Customs Service ($754,242 million) and the United States Trade Representative ($13,582 million) at levels in excess of the 1986 Budget request ($699,527 million and $11,431 million, respectively). The Administration would support enactment of S. 1146 if it were amended to (1) be consistent with the 1986 Budget request and (2) delete other substantive Customs-related amendments.
