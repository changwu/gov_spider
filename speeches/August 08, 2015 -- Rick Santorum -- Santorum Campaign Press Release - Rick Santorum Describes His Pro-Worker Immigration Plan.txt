    Rick Santorum, ?who is the proud son and grandson of immigrants who escaped Mussolini's fascist Italy, believes that immigration is a healthy thing for this country, but just like anything else there can be too much of a good thing. And right now, America is having too much of that good thing. That is why Rick Santorum believes we must reduce immigration levels to the United States in order to protect American workers from foreign labor that is taking jobs that Americans could otherwise hold.
He supports reducing immigration from about a million immigrants per year—the current level—down to about 750,000 per year. This will help blue collar American workers get back to work and thrive economically.
Every net new job created since 2000 for people between 18 and 65 is held be someone who wasn't born in this country. This needs to change.
