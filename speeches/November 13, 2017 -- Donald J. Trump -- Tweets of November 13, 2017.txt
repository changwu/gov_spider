I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} Were getting close! Now how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?Retweets: 16528Favorites: 77853
