    The United States commends the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the completion of presidential run-off and provincial elections. We congratulate President Kabila on his victory in the run-off election and urge all parties to uphold the ruling by the Congolese Supreme Court. Despite enormous logistical difficulties complicated by torrential rain, the voting process was peaceful and turnout was high. While noting some problems, international observers deemed that the electoral results successfully represent the will of the Congolese people. We applaud the supporting role played by the United Nations, South Africa, African Union, and European Union.
The United States stands with the Congolese people on this landmark occasion and will support their continued efforts to build a prosperous democracy.
