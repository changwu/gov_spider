    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after earning the endorsement of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. The USWCC is an economic leader for women and represents half a million business owners from across the country. This is the first time the USWCC has endorsed in a presidential election.
"The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce (USWCC) has spent over a decade helping women entrepreneurs succeed and grow their businesses, and today I'm proud to have their support. Women are important to our economic growth. They are opening about 1,200 new businesses per day and USWCC has been a key partner in helping them succeed.
"Women are often the breadwinners of their households and we should support them in starting and growing their businesses. That is why, as President, I would do everything in my power to help more women get access to start-up capital and professional mentoring. We need more women-owned businesses to compete and win federal contracts, and we must do everything to tear down the barriers that still hold too many women back.
"The bottom line is: what's good for women is good for America. When women are strong, families are strong â€“ and when families are strong, America is strong. I'll fight for more opportunities for women to develop their talents and pursue their dreams. I'll always put families first, just like I always have. That's a promise. I'm excited to join USWCC in the fight to lift up women entrepreneurs."
