    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1552, which will ensure that the growth of the Internet is not slowed by additional taxation.
The Internet is an innovative force that enables such applications as distance learning and precision farming. Government must do its part to make access to these services affordable. It should not raise costs through additional taxation.
Extending the moratorium is particularly important during this crucial holiday shopping season. Online spending is estimated to account for over 15 percent of total holiday purchases this year. H.R. 1522 will keep access to e-commerce services affordable. This law will be a big help to those Americans who shop from home because they are unable to travel to stores and malls.
