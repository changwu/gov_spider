Pool has been swept at JBA and we await POTUS' arrival. Note: we are taking the smaller Air Force One so we will have signal issues once onboard.

On Background from a White House Official:
Following the State of the Union address, where the President spoke about the historic progress building an economy from the bottom up and middle out - and creating good-paying, union jobs - the President will travel to a Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) training center in Deforest, Wisconsin, just outside of Madison. The President will discuss how his economic plan has ushered in a manufacturing boom and created good-paying jobs, including union jobs and jobs that don't require a four-year degree, across Wisconsin and the country. The President will meet with workers and apprentices, many of whom are training to do the jobs being created as a result of the President's American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act.
At Wednesday's event, the President will be introduced by Sarah, an apprentice and LIUNA member who specializes in road work and utilities. Sarah's father and brother worked in the construction trades. Sarah followed in their footsteps and began an apprenticeship through Wisconsin's Laborer's Apprenticeship program. Sarah found a passion for the work – she enthusiastically and quickly completed over 400 apprenticeship classroom hours. Sarah is confident about her future where she can build a career for herself with good-paying work to support a family, healthcare, and a pension.

Travel Pool #2: M1 wheels down + AF1 wheels up
M1 was wheels down at JBA at 10:17 am. President Biden, wearing his aviator sunglasses and blue suit, stepped off the helicopter at 10:22 and ambled across the tarmac to the small AF1. He ignored reporters' shouted questions about last night's State of the Union and the Republicans' reactions during the speech.
He boarded the AF1 at 10:24 and we will be wheels up shortly. Note: White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will gaggle on the flight and it will be live-streamed on the White House website.

Travel Pool #3: Wisconsin Arrival
AF1 was wheels down at 11:28 am CST at Truax Field Air National Guard Base in Madison, Wisconsin. It was a somewhat bumpy, though otherwise uneventful flight.
POTUS came down the steps at 11:40 and briefly spoke to the waiting greeters, including the governor of Wisconsin. The president then took a group selfie before strolling over to say hello to a small group of onlookers.
POTUS then stepped into the motorcade at 11:46 and we were rolling just two minutes later.
Our only visitor during the flight was White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who gaggled aboard AF1, beginning at 10:43 CST. She fielded questions for 25 minutes and it was live-streamed on the White House website. Among the topics hit: the president's reactions to the SOTU response, his faith in the GOP's declarations not to cut Social Security or Medicare, the Chinese spy ballon and the future of Secretary of Labor Mahty Walsh.
