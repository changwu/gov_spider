    Today, the Senate passed another SCHIP bill with major flaws, especially its failure to cover poor children first. Congress has known for weeks that the President would veto this bill. Now Congress should get back to work on legislation that covers poor children - and stop using valuable floor time to make partisan statements.
Like the previous bill, this bill also shifts children with private insurance onto the government rolls, uses taxpayers' dollars to subsidize middle class families, and raises taxes. It does all this while costing even more over the next five years than the version the President previously vetoed.
Whatever the Administration's policy differences with Congress, the President strongly supports reauthorizing SCHIP. Congress should address the serious flaws in this bill and produce legislation that puts poor children first and does not raise taxes. To relieve the minds of parents and governors, this program should be extended soon so that poor children do not lose health care because of partisan politics.
