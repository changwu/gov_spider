    First Lady Melania Trump joined Barbara Nicklaus, co-founder of the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation, for a celebratory luncheon in New York City today. At the luncheon, they recognized the advances in pediatric healthcare and announced a new healing garden, inspired by Mrs. Trump, which will open at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in the coming months.
During the event, Kristine J. Guleserian, M.D., a pediatric cardiovascular surgeon, shared how children from across the country and around the world receive lifesaving care at Nicklaus Children's Hospital, including multiple patients who have or will receive care at the hospital following the devastation of Hurricane Maria.
In her speech at today's luncheon, Mrs. Trump said, "As soon as I heard that Nicklaus Children's was planning to create a healing garden, I asked what I could do to help support those efforts. As many of you may know, the well-being of children is a priority for me. Whether it is physical, mental, educational or emotional, children deserve every resource and opportunity that we as adults can give them in order to grow up happy, healthy, and morally responsible adults.
It's true that elements of nature help with healing, and I look forward to traveling to Florida when the healing garden is ready, so that I can meet some of the brave patients and families who will benefit from all it will offer."
