    President Bush will welcome Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House on January 28, 2004. This visit will provide an opportunity to deepen our strategic partnership with our NATO ally, Turkey, on counterterrorism, Transatlantic relations, Iraq, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Eurasia, the Greater Middle East, and economics and trade. The meeting will occur at the start of an important year for Turkey, during which the city of Istanbul will host NATO's Summit in June.
