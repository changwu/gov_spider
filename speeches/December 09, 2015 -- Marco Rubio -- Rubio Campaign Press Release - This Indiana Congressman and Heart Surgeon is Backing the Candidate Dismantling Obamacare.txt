Citing Marco's success in battling the Obamacare bailout, Indiana conservative Representative Larry Bucshon is backing Marco.
Bucshon, a Newburgh Republican who's seeking a fourth term in 2016, said the 44-year-old Senator from Florida is the only candidate who's made progress in undermining the Affordable Care Act.
"I am proud to endorse him because he is a next-generation conservative who will repeal Obamacare and replace it with a 21st Century health care system," said Bucshon, a former heart surgeon. "Marco is the best candidate running to unite the party and inspire the nation, and I look forward to helping him win Indiana."
Bucshon, a heart surgeon, was elected in 2010 to represent Indiana's 8th District.
