    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services; the Environmental Protection Agency; International Assistance Programs; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Small Business Administration. In total, these amendments would not increase the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2006 Budget.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
