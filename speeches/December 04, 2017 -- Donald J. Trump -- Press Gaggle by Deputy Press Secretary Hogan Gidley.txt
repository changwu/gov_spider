MR. HOGAN: Hey, good evening, everybody. Good evening. Obviously, a lot of news to cover today. What I'd like to do, though, is start off at the top with a few items.
Number one would be the Supreme Court allowing full enforcement of President Trump's travel ban. And I'd like to read a statement. You can attribute this statement to me:
"We are not surprised by today's Supreme Court decision permitting immediate enforcement of the President's proclamation limiting travel from countries presenting heightened risks of terrorism. The proclamation is lawful and essential to protecting our homeland. We look forward to presenting a fuller defense of the proclamation as the pending cases work their way through the courts."
The second thing I'd like to cover off the top is Roy Moore. The President did speak briefly with Mr. Moore this morning from Air Force One to talk about the state of the race in Alabama and also to offer his endorsement. As we've said on multiple occasions, the President would much rather have someone in the Senate who supported his agenda as opposed to someone who did not.
We'd also like to talk about -- we can now confirm that the President did invite Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi to come to the White House this week. As soon as we have more details, we will confirm those with you guys as well.
And lastly, I'd like to address Jerusalem. That's obviously been an issue we've received a lot of incoming on today. The President has been clear on this issue from the get-go; that it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. No action, though, will be taken on the waiver today, and we will share a decision on the waiver in coming days.
