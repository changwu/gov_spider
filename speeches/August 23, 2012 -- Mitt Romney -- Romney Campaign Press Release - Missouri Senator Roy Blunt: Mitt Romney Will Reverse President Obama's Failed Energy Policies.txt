    U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"For years, the Obama Administration and the Democrat-controlled Senate have pursued destructive and burdensome regulations, leaving middle-class families in Missouri and nationwide with higher energy costs and fewer jobs. I've long said the shortest path to more American jobs is more American energy, and I believe that Governor Romney's plan for abundant, affordable energy will help put people back to work and encourage economic growth. Through his comprehensive energy strategy, we can achieve North American energy independence by 2020, create millions of jobs, and establish America as an energy superpower in the 21st century. I look forward to working with President Romney on smart energy policies that encourage more American energy and create more American jobs."
