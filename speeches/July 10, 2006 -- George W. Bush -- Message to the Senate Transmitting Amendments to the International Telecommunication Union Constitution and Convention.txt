    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the amendments to the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva, 1992), as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conference (Kyoto, 1994) and the Plenipotentiary Conference (Minneapolis, 1998), together with the declarations and reservations by the United States, all as contained in the Final Acts of the Plenipotentiary Conference (Marrakesh, 2002).
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning these amendments.
The Plenipotentiary Conference (Marrakesh, 2002) adopted amendments that would expand the field of individuals eligible for election to the Radio Regulations Board; provide for functional privileges and immunities for members of the Radio Regulations Board; strengthen the finances of the International Telecommunication Union by, among others, providing for sector member contributions to defray the expenses of regional conferences in which they participate and clarifying that operational plans prepared by the International Telecommunication Union Secretary-General and Directors of each of the International Telecommunication Union sectors must reflect the financial implications of the activities proposed; provide for sector members to be represented as observers at meetings of the Council; and recognize the authority of the Radiocommunication Assembly, the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly, and the World Telecommunication Development Conference to adopt working methods and procedures for their respective sectors.
Consistent with long-standing practices, the United States, in signing the 2002 amendments, made certain declarations and reservations. Subject to those declarations and reservations, I believe the United States should ratify the 2002 amendments to the International Telecommunication Union Constitution and Convention. Those amendments will contribute to the International Telecommunication Union's ability to adapt to changes in the telecommunication environment and, in so doing, serve the needs of the United States Government and United States industry. It is my hope that the Senate will take early action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
