LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul beats President Barack Obama in a head-to-head matchup among the nation's voters, according to a new Rasmussen Poll.
Congressman Paul bests President Obama 43 to 41 percent according to voters' preference. Obama would beat Newt Gingrich 49 percent to 39 percent and Rick Santorum 45 percent to 43 percent while Mitt Romney would beat Obama by two percent within the poll's +/- 3 percent margin of error.
"This is further evidence of the fact that Ron Paul is the only candidate who can defeat Barack Obama," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.  "Ron Paul was the only candidate to predict the economic disarray we currently face and he is the only candidate to solve these problems.  In order to win back the White House, Republicans must nominate a consistent candidate that offers something besides the status quo.  Ron Paul is that candidate."
The results were collected via telephone surveys of 500 likely voters per night and reported on a three-day rolling average. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 1,500 likely voters is +/- 3 percentage points.
