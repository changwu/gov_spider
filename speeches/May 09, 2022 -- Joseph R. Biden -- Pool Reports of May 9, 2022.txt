Pool report 9: Heading to Lend-Lease Act signing in Oval
The pool gathered at 2:46pm to be led to the Oval Office, where Biden is set to sign the Ukraine Lend-Lease program into law.
A reminder on this program: it permits faster shipments of military equipment to Ukraine (with the cost deferred), is based on a WWII-era program to help Europe resist Hitler and was supported by nearly every member of Congress — though 10 House Republicans voted against it. It’s also being signed on the same day Russia commemorated its role in combating Hitler.

Selected quotes:
The U.S. supports Ukrainians "in their fight to defend their country and their democracy against Putin's brutal war"
"Every day Ukrainains fight for their lives... The cost of the fight is not cheap but caving to aggression is even more costly"
POTUS noted that yesterday was VE Day (marking the end of WWII) and today is Europe Day, the anniversary of the effort at European integration that produced the European Union. "It's something that is good for everyone," he said.
POTUS was talking to Slotkin and shaking her hand as pool left. Note that she served in the Obama administration before running for Congress.
