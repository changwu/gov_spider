    Today, Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz joined elected officials and community leaders in endorsing Joe Biden for President.
"To defeat Donald Trump, we need a candidate who can speak to, unite, and secure opportunities for our working class," said Washington State Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz. "Joe Biden is the candidate that will take the fight to Donald Trump and deliver real progress for workers in Washington State and America. He will lead on raising the minimum wage, making it easier to unionize, and taking on climate change."
Franz was elected as State Commissioner of Public Lands in 2016. Prior to that she served on the Bainbridge Island City Council.
Today's endorsements also include:

Monica Stonier, State Representative
Tim Probst, Former State Representative
Larry Seaquist, Former State Representative

Germaine Kornegay, Sedro Woolley City Councilmember
John McKay, Former U.S. Attorney
Chris Stearns, Auburn City Councilmember
Sam Cho, Seattle Port Commissioner

Franz's endorsement builds on the endorsement of former Washington Governor Chris Gregoire, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, former Washington Governor, Secretary of Commerce, and U.S. Ambassador to China, Gary Locke, State Senator Marko Liias as well as numerous other Washington leaders from across the state. Biden for President has announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.
