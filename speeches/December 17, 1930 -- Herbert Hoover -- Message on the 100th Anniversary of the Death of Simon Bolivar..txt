THE PEOPLE of the United States join with me in honoring the memory of the Great Liberator, Simon Bolivar. All the nations of the American Continent owe him a debt of gratitude not only because of his military achievements, but also by reason of his prophetic political vision which enabled him to lay the foundations of Pan Americanism as well as to foresee the important part which the nations of America are called upon to play in world affairs.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
