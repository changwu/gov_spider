    Helena, MT – After another marathon Democratic debate more focused on landing viral soundbites than offering solutions to problems voters face every day, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"Six debates in and the Democratic Party is still failing to speak to the challenges middle class families face every day. When 40% of Americans wouldn't have $400 to spare in the event of an emergency, we need to be talking about serious solutions that will make people's lives better in the here and now — not a decade down the line, and not after a hypothetical political revolution," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "Voters are looking for a leader who isn't detached from the realities that they face — and with 111 days left until the Iowa Caucus, I'm going to continue taking my case directly to them."
