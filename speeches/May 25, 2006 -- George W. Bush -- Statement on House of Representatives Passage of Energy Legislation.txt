    I applaud today's vote in the House to allow for environmentally responsible energy exploration in a small part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. A reliable domestic supply of energy is important to America's security and prosperity. This project will keep our economy growing by creating jobs and ensuring that businesses can expand. And it will make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy, eventually by up to a million barrels of crude oil a dayâ€”a nearly 20 percent increase over our current domestic production. I thank the House leadership and Chairman Pombo for their hard work on this issue. I urge the Senate to join the House in passing ANWR legislation.
