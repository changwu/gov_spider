    The President welcomes the strong vote of the United States Olympic Committee House of Delegates not to send a United States team to the Moscow Olympics in light of his advice that to send a team would be contrary to our national interest. The President has authorized me to say that this advice will not change by May 20 or at any time thereafter. For all practical purposes, therefore, the House of Delegates vote means that the United States will not send a team to Moscow.
As the Vice President stated today, the President and the Congress will support the USOC efforts to strengthen its financial position.
They will also give appropriate honor and recognition to the American athletes who are making the sacrifice of not competing in Moscow.
Now that the USOC has made clear that it will not take part in the Moscow games, we are confident that other leading nations of the free world will join in this demonstration that no nation is entitled to serve as host for an Olympic festival of peace while it persists in invading and subjugating another nation.
