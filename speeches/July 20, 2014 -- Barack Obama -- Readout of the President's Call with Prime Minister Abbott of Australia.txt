    This evening, President Obama spoke again with Australian Prime Minister Abbott to discuss Malaysia Airlines flight 17. The President and Prime Minister reiterated their agreement that there must be a prompt, full, unimpeded and transparent international investigation. The two leaders also agreed that Russia has a responsibility to use its extraordinary influence with the pro-Russian separatists who control the crash site to compel them to cooperate with international monitors and investigators. As strong allies, the President underscored that the U.S. will continue to support and coordinate closely with Australia as this issue moves forward.
