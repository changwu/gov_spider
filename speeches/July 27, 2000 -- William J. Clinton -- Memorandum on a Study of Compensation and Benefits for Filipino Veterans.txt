    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense 
Subject: Study of Compensation and Benefits for Filipino Veterans
My Administration has recognized the unique contribution of Filipino veterans of the Second World War and worked to improve their compensation and benefits. In fact, for the last two sessions of Congress we have proposed legislation to eliminate the current dollar limitation for authorized compensation payments to Filipino beneficiaries residing in the United States. The proposed legislation has not been enacted. This reality, coupled with the fact that numerous Filipino veterans have immigrated to this country, suggests that the we need to raise awareness of the issues and options to help this group of deserving veterans.
To that end, I am directing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to complete a study by October 31, 2000, of the needs of these veterans and the options available for addressing those needs. This study shall be conducted in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of State, and the Department of Defense, and would include a historical background of, and the issues associated with, the benefits afforded to Filipino veterans. It should also take into consideration changes in the Filipino veteran population and review options relative to the benefits afforded these veterans. It also would include the cost implications of options approved by OMB.
