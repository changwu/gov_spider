    Q. Mr. President, is there a better chance now that the hostages may be released before you leave office? Are things looking up?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't want to raise any unwarranted expectations, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International]. Every time we've had a favorable response from the Iranians, later on we've been disappointed.
I sent the Deputy Secretary of State over to Algeria last night to make our own positions clear. I believe it's a proposal that would be acceptable to the American people as fair and also to the Iranians as being fair.
I hope that we can resolve it before I go out of office, but I can't predict that that will happen.
Q. Do you suspect this is your last opportunity, Mr. President, to solve this problem?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, obviously the time is getting close, but we'll continue to do our best until the last moment I'm in office. I hope we can be successful, but I can't predict that.
Q. Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
