    We will forever honor the memory of the 13 servicemembers who were stolen far too soon from their families, loved ones, and brothers-and sisters-in-arms, while performing a noble mission on behalf of our Nation. We can never repay the incredible sacrifice of any of the 2,461
U.S. servicemembers who lost their lives over two decades of war in Afghanistan or the 20,744 who were wounded. But we will never fail to honor our sacred obligation to our servicemembers and veterans, as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors.
Today Jill and I remember and mourn these 13 brave American servicemembers and the more than 100 innocent Afghan civilians who were killed in the horrific terrorist attack at Abbey Gate. Many more were injured and will carry the impacts of their wounds and the horrors of that day for the rest of their lives.
We pray for the families of our fallen warriors. We grieve with them, we honor them, and we will always continue to support them.
