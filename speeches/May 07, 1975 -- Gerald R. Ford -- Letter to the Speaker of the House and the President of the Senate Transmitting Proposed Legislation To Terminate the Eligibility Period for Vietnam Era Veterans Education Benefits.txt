    I AM transmitting today a proposed bill "To amend title 38, United States Code, to set a termination date for veterans educational benefits under Chapter 34 and 36 of such title, and for other purposes."
The bill would terminate the eligibility period for GI Bill education and training benefits for persons who will be entering peacetime voluntary military service on or after July 1, 1975.
I have today also issued a Proclamation which fixes the period of Vietnam service as beginning on August 5, 1964, and ending on May 7, 1975, for certain wartime benefits.
The effect of these actions is similar to those terminating wartime veterans benefits following the cessation of World War I, World War II, and the Korean War hostilities.
The Proclamation and this legislation would make an equitable distinction between those who have been required to perform military service and those who in the future choose to serve in the All-Volunteer Armed Forces. The termination actions will not affect the eligibility of the millions of Vietnam veterans already discharged, or those presently serving in the Armed Forces.
I urge the Congress to give prompt and favorable consideration to the draft bill.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
