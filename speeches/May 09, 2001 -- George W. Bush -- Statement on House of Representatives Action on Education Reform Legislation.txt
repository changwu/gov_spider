    I commend members of the House Education and Workforce Committee for taking the first step toward reforming America's education system and making sure no child is left behind. This legislation includes monumental reforms that promote real accountability, annual testing, and funding flexibility. Parents need to know if their children are making progress, and this legislation meets that priority. I am also pleased that this bill gives unprecedented freedom and flexibility to States and local school districts to determine the best way to spend their Federal education dollars.
I urge Members of Congress to continue building upon our efforts to expand parental options. I will support amendments on the House floor that increase parental options and involvement.
I applaud Chairman John Boehner and Ranking Minority Member George Miller for working in a bipartisan way to move this important piece of legislation forward.
