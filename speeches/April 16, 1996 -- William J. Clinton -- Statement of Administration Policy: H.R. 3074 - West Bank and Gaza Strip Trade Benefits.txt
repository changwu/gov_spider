(House)(Crane (R) IL and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 3074.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3074 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB' s preliminary scoring estimate is that enactment of the bill would result in an insignificant reduction in receipts. Final scoring of this legislation may change this estimate.
