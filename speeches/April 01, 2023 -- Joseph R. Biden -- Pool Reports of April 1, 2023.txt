Out of town pool report #3
The pool arrived at University of Pennsylvania at 12:33 PM. "The President and the First Lady are visiting Maisy Biden's senior art show at the University of Pennsylvania, Addams Gallery," according to the White House.
Your pooler was unable to see President Biden exit the motorcade from our holding position.
We crossed from Delaware over to Pennsylvania at 12:07 PM.
The roads were noticeably slippery â€” the pool van did have a hard stop four minutes after crossing state lines. No one was injured and we resumed moving after a brief moment.
Thanks all.

Out of town pool report #6 Leaving brunch
Before the president exited the restaurant, people on the second floor of the Curtis Institute of Music could be heard rehearsing The Star Spangled Banner for those on the sidewalk to hear. The institute is across the street from Parc.
Dozens crowded across S 18th street in Rittenhouse Square to snap a photo of the president.
Biden, the First Lady and their family used the Locust street exit to leave Parc at 2:50 PM. The musicians across the street began playing the Star Spangled Banner.
Biden seemed to immediately hear the music and looked up to see where it was coming from. The president then walked up to S 18th to wave and give a thumbs up to the cheering crowd across the street.
He then walked back down Locust street. The First Lady stopped and looked up to the open window of the Institute where the music was coming from, clapped and shouted "thank you!" Biden shouted "Don't jump!"
We're rolling.
