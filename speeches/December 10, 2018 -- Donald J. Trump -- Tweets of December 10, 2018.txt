I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!Retweets: 17329Favorites: 87406

'Democrats can't find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey's testimony. No Smocking Gun...No Collusion.' @FoxNews That's because there was NO COLLUSION. So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution...Retweets: 25245Favorites: 104794

....which it was not (but even if it was it is only a CIVIL CASE like Obama's - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!Retweets: 22947Favorites: 101074
