    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lehman (D) California and 246 others)
The Administration does not oppose enactment of H.R. 4962 if it is Congress' judgment that this is the appropriate event to commemorate, by the minting of a coin, in 1992.
The Administration would oppose enactment of more than one commemorative coin bill for 1992. More than one commemorative coin program during the same time period taxes the Mint's die making capacity and is detrimental to the success of each program. The Administration notes, that Congress is also considering a coin bill (H.R. 2754) commemorating the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America in 1992.
