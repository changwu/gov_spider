    On Tuesday, November 21st, President Donald J. Trump will pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. This year, the President will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation, as he reflects on our Nation's rich Thanksgiving traditions and wishes American families a safe and healthy holiday.
After the pardoning, the turkeys will join last year's turkeys at Virginia Tech's "Gobblers Rest" exhibit, where students and veterinarians care for the turkeys, and the public can visit and learn about the university's teaching, research, and outreach programs in animal and poultry sciences and veterinary medicine.
Both birds were raised in Western Minnesota under the supervision of National Turkey Federation Chairman Carl Wittenburg and his wife Sharlene, along with five young women from the Douglas County 4-H chapter.
The National Turkey Federation will also bring two turkeys from Jaindl's Turkey Farm of Orefield, Pennsylvania, for the First Family to donate. The First Family will donate the turkeys to Martha's Table in Washington, D.C.
