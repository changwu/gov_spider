    I speak today with the sadness the whole world feels at the sentence given Anatoly Shcharanskiy. We are all sobered by this reminder that, so late in the 20th century, a person can be sent to jail simply for asserting his basic human rights.
It is saddest of all for the Soviet people, who in their time have known war and oppression; who yearn like all others for peace and liberty; who have seen their own Government pledge 2 years ago to respect those human rights and desires; and who now have seen that pledge broken once again.
The struggle for human liberties is long and difficult, but it will be won. There is no power on Earth that can long delay its progress.
