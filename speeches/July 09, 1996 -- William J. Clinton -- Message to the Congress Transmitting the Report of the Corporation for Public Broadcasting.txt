    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1995 and the Inventory of the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications Entities by Federal Departments and Agencies: Fiscal Year 1995.
Since 1967, when the Congress created the Corporation, CPB has overseen the growth and development of quality services for millions of Americans.
This year's report highlights ways the Corporation has helped millions of American families and children gain new learning opportunities through technology. At a time when technology is advancing at a pace that is as daunting as it is exhilarating, it is crucial for all of us to work together to understand and take advantage of these changes.
By continuing to broadcast programs that explore the challenging issues of our time, by working with local communities and schools to introduce more and more children to computers and the Internet, in short, by honoring its commitment to enriching the American spirit, the Corporation is preparing all of us for the 21st
century.
