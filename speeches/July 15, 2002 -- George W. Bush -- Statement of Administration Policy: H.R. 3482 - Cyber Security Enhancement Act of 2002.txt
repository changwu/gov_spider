    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) Texas and 25 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 3482, but will seek to delete from the bill Title II relating to the Office of Science and Technology. The Administration strongly opposes Title II of H.R. 3482, because it would separate the Office of Science and Technology from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The Office of Science and Technology is currently an integral component part of NIJ, which is the Nation's resource for crime and justice research and development, whether related to the social sciences or technology. The Administration urges that the Office of Science and Technology remain, as it is today, part of NIJ.
