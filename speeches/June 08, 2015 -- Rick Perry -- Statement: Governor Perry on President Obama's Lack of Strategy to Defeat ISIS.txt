    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry issued the following statement regarding President Obama's admission today that he still does not have a strategy to defeat ISIS:
"It is a failure of leadership that nine months after President Obama first said we don't have a strategy to defeat ISIS, the United States is in no better position in the fight against this radical terror group. As we see ISIS continue to inspire more followers and see Ramadi fall under their control, the Obama Administration's rhetoric about 'setbacks' does not match the reality on the ground. Positive rhetoric alone does not solve problems, action does. If I were Commander-in-Chief, it would not take nine months to work with our military leaders to develop a complete strategy to destroy ISIS and protect American security interests and values."
FLASHBACK: In August 2014 President Obama Said The United States Didn't "Have A Strategy Yet" To Combat ISIS. "President Barack Obama seemed to commit the worst of Washington gaffes Thursday when he updated the American people about the ongoing threat from Islamist militants wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria. 'I don't want to put the cart before the horse: we don't have a strategy yet,' Obama said of the effort to combat the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) in its safe haven in Syria."
