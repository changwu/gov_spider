    The President is pleased that Judge Leslie Southwick will soon receive a fair up or down vote by the full Senate. Today's bipartisan vote of support by the Senate Judiciary Committee is a refreshing victory for America's judicial system.
Leslie Southwick has proven to be an excellent judge and a man of great integrity. In addition to receiving the American Bar Association's highest possible rating, Judge Southwick is widely respected for his sound legal mind and extensive experience in both the public and private sector. After serving for over a decade on the Mississippi Court of Appeals and recently as a member of Mississippi National Guard's 155th Brigade Combat Team in Iraq, he has demonstrated his clear commitment to serving the people of Mississippi and our Nation. When confirmed, Judge Southwick will serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals with distinction.
