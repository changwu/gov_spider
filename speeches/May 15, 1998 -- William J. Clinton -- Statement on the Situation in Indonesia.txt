    I am deeply concerned about the upsurge in violence in Indonesia. I intend to discuss my concerns today with my other colleagues.
The recent deaths in Indonesia are tragic, and I call on the Indonesian Government and the security forces to avoid violence and exercise maximum restraint.
I strongly urge the Indonesian Government to initiate quickly a dialog on reform with its citizens. Giving the people of Indonesia a real voice in the country's political affairs can make a real contribution to restoring political order and stability based on human rights and the rule of law.
We are working closely with our friends and allies to help the Indonesian people meet their humanitarian needs. I believe that if the Government of Indonesia pursues the needed economic and political reforms, Indonesia can return to the path of recovery and growth.
