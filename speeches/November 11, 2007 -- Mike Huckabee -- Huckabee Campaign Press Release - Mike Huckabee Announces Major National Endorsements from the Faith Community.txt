    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee today announced additional endorsements from influential faith leaders across the country, augmenting a strong show of support he received Friday from Southern Baptist Convention leaders.
The new major endorsements include:
· Stephen Strang, Founder of Charisma Magazine – Lake Mary, Fla.
· Rick Scarborough, President and founder of Vision America – Pearland, Tex.
· Jerry Cox, President of Arkansas Family Council – Little Rock, Ark.
· Janet Folger, President of Faith2Action – Dania Beach, Fla.
· Jim Pfaff, President and CEO of Colorado Family Action – Castle Rock, Col.
· Mathew Staver, Founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel – Lynchburg , Va.
· Kelly Shackelford, President of Free Market Foundation – Plano, Tex.
· Phil Burress, President of Citizens for Community Values – Ohio
"To have the support of these leaders of faith means so much to me," Huckabee said. "I have the greatest level of respect for each person – and I know they will be vital in helping me spread my conservative message of hope and my vision for a stronger America ."
Stephen Strang, who was recognized by Time magazine in 2005 as one of the "Top 25 Evangelicals in America," said: "Mike Huckabee is an outstanding communicator who has a proven track record of success as governor of Arkansas . He is a true conservative who holds values common to most Americans. Governor Huckabee is a strong, Bible-believing candidate who articulates our values as well as any politician in my lifetime."
Rick Scarborough, who heads Vision America, a national coalition of Pastors whose mission is to call Christians to be proactive in restoring America to her Judeo-Christian heritage, said: "In Mike Huckabee, we have a man who has successfully bridged the chasm that divides people of both parties who share common values and faith. At this time in American history, we desperately need someone to lead us who can step over the partisan divide and unite people if we are going to solve the massive problems facing our nation."
Jerry Cox, who is also the past director of Unborn Child Amendment Committee, said: "Long before his involvement in politics, he was a defender of the unborn, a promoter of character in our schools, and stalwart champion for traditional values. His compassion for people, his command of the issues, his faith in God, and his genuine desire to work with people on both sides of the aisle are a rare find in the politics of today."
Janet Folger, who also served as national director of the Center for Reclaiming America, said: "We have one more chance to get our country and our courts back, and only one candidate we can count on to do it: Governor Mike Huckabee. He provides solution to the issues we care most about."
Jim Pfaff, who is president and CEO of the Colorado Family Action and has been active in pro-life/pro-family politics for more than 20 years, said: "It is critical, at this time in the history of our country, that our elected representatives truly understand the significant role that families play in our culture today and in the future. Mike Huckabee has been a reliable champion for the values of faith, family and the protection of the unborn over many years of public service."
Mathew Staver is Dean of Liberty University School of Law and founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a nationally prominent legal, educational and policy organization specializing in religious liberty, the sanctity of human life and the traditional family. He said: "We need a leader who understands and is prepared to confront radical Islamic terrorism, who will protect America and her boarders, who does not merely lip sync moral and religious values but who really believes and practices them, and who has the experience and personality to govern a divided Congress. Mike Huckabee is that man."
Kelly Shackelford, who serves as Chief Counsel of Liberty Legal Institute and president of Free Market Foundation, said: "The reason you are starting to see everyone coalesce around Mike is that he doesn't just talk about conservative issues, he breathes them and has a passion for them. He speaks the truth with an honesty and grace that no other candidate can match in either party."
Phil Burress, the president of Citizens for Community Values who won this year's Focus on the Family Grassroots Action Award, said: "I have met and interviewed most of the Republican Presidential candidates. After several months of research, I am pleased to announce that Governor Mike Huckabee is the most qualified candidate to hold the office of President of the United States ," Burress said.
"I am humbled by the faith and confidence that these strong advocates of faith and freedom have placed in me to lead our great nation forward. I look forward to working with them as we move forward together in the weeks and months ahead," said Huckabee.
