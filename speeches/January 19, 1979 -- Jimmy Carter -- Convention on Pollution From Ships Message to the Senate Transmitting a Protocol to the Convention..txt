    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, a certified copy of the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, with its Annexes I and II, and Protocols I and II, 1973, done at London February 17, 1978 (the MARPOL Protocol). I send along with it, for the Senate's consideration, the State Department's report.
The MARPOL Protocol results from proposals the United States made last year following a series of tanker incidents in or near United States waters. It aims to reduce accidental and operational pollution from tankers. The Protocol applies many new operating and construction standards to more tankers than are covered by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (the MARPOL Convention). The MARPOL Convention has not been ratified by the United States, and has not entered into force.
The MARPOL Protocol incorporates, with modifications, the MARPOL Convention transmitted to the Senate on March 22, 1977 for advice and consent to ratification. Ratification of the Protocol will, therefore, constitute acceptance of the provisions of the Convention, subject to the modifications and additions contained in the Protocol. Accordingly, I request that the Senate give advice and consent to the Protocol in place of the Convention. The MARPOL Convention contains three optional Annexes, Annexes III, IV and V, which deal with pollution from packaged harmful substances, sewage and garbage. I am not now seeking the Senate's advice and consent to these optional annexes.
The entry into force of the MARPOL Protocol will be an important step in controlling and preventing pollution from vessel discharges. I recommend that the Senate give early consideration to this Protocol and advise and consent to its ratification.
