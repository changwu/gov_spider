Another informative exercise would have been for each state delegation to announce how many jobs Biden's failed policies have killed in their communities, through high taxes and regulations, disastrous trade deals, and coddling of economic rivals like China. While television networks will never get that time back, someone should have explained that Biden will give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens and award them work permits so they can compete with Americans for jobs. And finally, someone should have explained to Joe Biden that he is now the official nominee of the Democrat Party, meaning his supervisors from the radical left are now formally in charge."
