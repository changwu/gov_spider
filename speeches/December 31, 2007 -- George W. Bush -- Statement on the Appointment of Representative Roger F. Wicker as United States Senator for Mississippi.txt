    Today Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour announced the appointment of Representative Roger Wicker to serve as United States Senator for the State of Mississippi, succeeding Senator Trent Lott.
I welcome Representative Wicker's appointment and commend Governor Barbour for the selection. Representative Wicker's leadership has earned the respect of his constituents and his colleagues inthe House of Representatives. He is an advocate for our men and women in uniform and a champion of modernizing our health care system, and he shares Senator Lott's commitment to promote the interests of the people of Mississippi.
I look forward to working with Roger in his new role representing Mississippi in the United States Senate.
