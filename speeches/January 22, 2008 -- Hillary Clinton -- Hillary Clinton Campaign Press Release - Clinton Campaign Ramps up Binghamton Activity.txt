    BINGHAMTON, NY – In addition to announcing the opening of a regional office in Binghamton – and dozens across the state -- the Clinton campaign has ramped up activity in the Binghamton area. The campaign is actively recruiting supporters, volunteers, and "ambassadors" in the region to assist with critical organizing, phone banking and visibility in the area.
Following are some upcoming events and gatherings (closed to media) underscoring the strength of the campaign's grassroots activity and outreach:


On Wednesday, January 23, the campaign will host a meeting for local supporters, where it will recruit new volunteers and supporters in the run-up to the primary.
On Sunday, January 27, the campaign will host an Ambassadors for Hillary Meeting. Ambassadors for Hillary is a grass-roots effort to engage, inform and energize women to be advocates for Hillary. Hillary campaign staff will attend the meeting to discuss why Hillary is the best choice to be President.
On Thursday, January 31, the Democratic Women of Broome County will sponsor a Debate Watch Party to watch the last debate before the February 5th primary. Following the debate, the party will dial-in to a special conference call with campaign supporters to discuss Hillary's performance in the debate.
Over the weekend before the primary, Gloria Whitmore, the former chair of the Tioga County Democrats, will travel throughout the 22nd Congressional District campaigning for Hillary in each of the nine counties.
On February 4th, the evening before the primary, the campaign's regional office will host a gathering for local supporters and volunteers at "bonfire park" near the county's regional office, 39 Washington Street.

Those interested in attending any of the events or in volunteering for the campaign can contact the Binghamton campaign office at 607-773-8369.
