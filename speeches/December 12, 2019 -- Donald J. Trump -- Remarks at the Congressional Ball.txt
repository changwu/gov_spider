    The President. Well, thank you very much. We're having a very exciting month in Washington, DC. There haven't been too many like it.
I will say this: We have the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And the stock market, as you probably have heard—all those 401(k)s and all of those jobs out there—the stock market just hit a brandnew high. That will be 129 records that we have in, really, fairly much, substantially less than 3 years. So that's something.
Our country is doing really great. I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank our great Vice President and Karen for being with us. Where's Mike?
Vice President Michael R. Pence. Right here, Mr. President. Thank you.
The President. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. Thank you.
And I want to congratulate Melania. She did such a beautiful job with the decorations. She did such a beautiful job.
We're very proud of this country. We're very proud of this home. We call it a home; some Presidents called it a house. And some Presidents called it much worse than a house, I will say. [Laughter] But we love the White House. It's a special place. And our country is a special country.
I just want to thank you. We're going to come down and mingle and see everybody. We'll spend some time here.
Have a good time tonight. But happy New Year, merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah. We're going to have a fantastic year. We're going to have the best year we've had in many, many decades. This is—we're set up for one great, big, beautiful success.
Thank you all for being here. Thank you for being with us. Thank you very much.
