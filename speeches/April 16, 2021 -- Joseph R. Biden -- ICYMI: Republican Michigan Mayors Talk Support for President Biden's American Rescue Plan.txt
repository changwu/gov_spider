    Yesterday, Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett (R) and Sterling Heights Mayor Michael Taylor (R) sat down with Fox 2 Detroit's Roop Raj to talk about the American Rescue Plan and the help it's brought – and will continue to bring – to their cities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The two Mayors – both Republicans – touted the direct aid to state and local government, that is having a profound effect on their cities, helping them get back to normal.

"The biggest impact I can talk about directly is $20 million in direct federal aid that we're receiving from the federal government as a part of this plan," said Mayor Taylor. "It's been a great benefit to our city, whether our residents want to admit it or not."
The millions of dollars in aid will help cities like Sterling Heights and Rochester Hills make ends meet after a year of hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue lost to the pandemic.
Mayor Barnett explained the importance of getting money directly to local officials:
"When you have direct control of the spending and the ability to move it quickly and effectively, I consistently feel that local levels of government are the best able to plug the hole needed because they understand them better."
Barnett also expressed his pleasure with the Biden administration's efforts thus far.
The funding will not only help cities make ends meet, but will also lend a helping hand to struggling small business, which have been shuttered or forced to cut back during the pandemic.
"It's getting things back to normal – trying to get things back to normal. And that federal money is going to go a long way in making sure that we can continue to provide the services that our residents have come to expect and deserve."
