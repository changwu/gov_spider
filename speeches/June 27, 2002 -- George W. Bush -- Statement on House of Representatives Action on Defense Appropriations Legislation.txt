    I commend the Members of the House for their strong, bipartisan show of unity in our war against terrorism with passage of the defense appropriations bill. I urge the Senate to work in a similar bipartisan fashion and pass the bill in July so that our men and women in the armed services have every resource they need to continue defending freedom. It is critical in this time of war that the defense appropriations bill be at the front, not the end, of the legislative line. Our troops deserve nothing less.
