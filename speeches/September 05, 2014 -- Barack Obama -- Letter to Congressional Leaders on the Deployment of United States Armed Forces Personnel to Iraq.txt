    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
As I previously reported on June 16 and June 30, 2014, U.S. Armed Forces personnel have deployed to Iraq to provide security and support for U.S. personnel and facilities. On September 2, 2014, I authorized up to approximately 350 additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel to deploy to Iraq to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The first of these additional personnel arrived in Iraq on September 4, 2014. This force is deploying for the purpose of protecting U.S. citizens and property, if necessary, and is equipped for combat. This force will remain in Iraq until the security situation becomes such that it is no longer needed.
This action is being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq and has been directed consistent with my responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
