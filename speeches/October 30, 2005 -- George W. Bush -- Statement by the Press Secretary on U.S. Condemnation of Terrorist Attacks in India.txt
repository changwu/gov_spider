    The United States strongly condemns the heinous terrorist attacks in India. By targeting innocent civilians making final preparations for holiday celebrations, terrorists have demonstrated yet again that they are enemies of humanity and contemptuous of the values all in the civilized world share. On behalf of the American people, the President extends his deepest condolences to all of those who lost loved ones.
