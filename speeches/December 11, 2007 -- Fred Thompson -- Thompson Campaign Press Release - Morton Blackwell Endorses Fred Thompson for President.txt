McLean, VA - Today the Fred Thompson campaign announced that conservative leader and Virginia Republican National Committeeman Morton Blackwell is endorsing Senator Thompson for President of the United States.
"Of all the candidates who have a chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination, Fred Thompson is my choice," said Morton Blackwell. "Senator Thompson has the most conservative instincts on the public policy issues that are important to America."
Morton Blackwell is well known in conservative circles as the Founder and President of the Leadership Institute, an educational foundation, which trains young conservatives for leadership in the political sphere. Prior to founding the Leadership Institute, Mr. Blackwell was Barry Goldwater's youngest elected delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco. He was a national convention Alternate Delegate for Ronald Reagan in 1968 and 1976, and a Ronald Reagan Delegate at the 1980 national convention. He currently serves as a Virginia Republican National Committeeman.
"I am grateful for the endorsement of Morton Blackwell, who is one of the most respected leaders of the conservative movement in America," said Senator Thompson. "His long history in the conservative movement matches my own journey. We were both early supporters of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and we have been consistent conservatives since. I appreciate Morton's confidence in my commitment to conservative principles, my vision for our country, and my ability to lead it."
