    We are increasingly concerned by news reports today of an economic crackdown in Lithuania. Although our information is sketchy, we are disturbed that this signals another unfortunate step in the pressure being brought to bear on Lithuania by the Soviet Union.
The President has stepped up consultations with our allies concerning appropriate responses that the United States should take. We expect these consultations, now underway through a wide array of diplomatic channels, to be concluded early next week. At that time, President Bush will meet with congressional leaders to advise them of our consultations and to discuss possible courses of action. We continue to urge the Soviet Union to pursue a course of peaceful dialog in the hope that this matter can be resolved in a responsible manner.
