(House Rules)
(Rep. Shuster, R-Pennsylvania, and 12 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 749, which aligns with the Administration's goals of driving improved performance at Amtrak through accountability and encouraging States' participation in planning and funding improvements to passenger rail corridors. The legislation does not, however, contain adequate railroad safety provisions nor provide the level of resources, long-term certainty, and additional organizational reforms that are included in the Administration's GROW AMERICA proposal to support a high performance rail system. The Administration also looks forward to working with the Congress to improve or clarify certain other aspects of the bill, such as the time-limited approval process for grants.
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact its fully-paid-for GROW AMERICA proposal, which provides $478 billion over six years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail programs. By incorporating rail into the surface transportation multi-year funding framework, the GROW AMERICA proposal provides the funding and certainty needed to improve passenger rail service at the national, regional, and State levels, enable local communities to implement critical grade crossing safety measures, and help commuter railroads enhance safety by installing positive train control systems. The Administration urges the Congress to move quickly to enact a long-term surface transportation bill that lays the foundation for long-term economic growth.
