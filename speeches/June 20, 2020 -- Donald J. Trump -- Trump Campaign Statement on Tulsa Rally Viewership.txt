    "President Trump's rally in Tulsa attracted over 4 million unique viewers across all of the campaign's digital media channels. The live-streamed pre-rally shows drew an audience of more than 2.5 million unique viewers by themselves. These numbers don't even include television viewers. The news media, which encouraged protestors and bombarded Americans for more than a week with dire warnings against attending a Trump rally, are still unable to prevent President Trump from reaching the people. These numbers represent unmatched enthusiasm behind the President's re-election and a massive audience that Joe Biden can only dream of."
