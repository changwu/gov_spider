    AUSTIN â€“ Gov. Rick Perry issued the following statement on today's announcement that the federal debt has now hit $15 trillion dollars:
"Today, the federal debt hit a depressing $15 trillion. This astounding debt is a heavy pair of cement shoes for our children and America's economic future. Now more than ever, America needs leadership committed to overhauling Washington. That's why my Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan includes a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, a ban on earmarks, real spending and tax relief, and a part-time Congress to bring fiscal conservatism and responsibility back to our nation's capital."
