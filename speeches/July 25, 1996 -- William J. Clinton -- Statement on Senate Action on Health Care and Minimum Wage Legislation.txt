    I am pleased that the Senate has broken the gridlock and appointed conferees to deal with two of my highest priorities to help working families: health care and the minimum wage. I commend the leadership of both parties who have diligently worked to reach this point.
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will allow American workers the security of knowing that they will not lose their health coverage if they change their jobs. We now have the opportunity to move forward and enact real health insurance reform this year.
Raising the minimum wage for millions of America's hardest workers is also the right thing to do. Working parents simply cannot support a family on $4.25 an hour.
I urge the conferees to take swift action on these two important measures before the August recess. America's working families deserve nothing less.
