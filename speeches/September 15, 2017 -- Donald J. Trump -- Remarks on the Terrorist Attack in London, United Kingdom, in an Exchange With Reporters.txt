    Q. Mr. President, any reaction to London, the terror attack?
The President. No, it's a terrible thing, just keeps going and going. And we have to be very smart; we have to be very, very tough, which perhaps we're not nearly tough enough. But that is just an absolutely terrible thing. In fact, I'm going to call the Prime Minister right now.
Q. Have you been briefed on any intelligence about the attack?
The President. Yes, I have, on numerous things happening, including North Korea.
Q. [Inaudible]—on the London attack——
The President. So I've been briefed, and I'm going in right now for the briefing. And I'm going to see Frank inside too.
Q. What did you mean when you said that the Muslim ban had to be more specific?
The President. We have to be tougher, and we have to be smarter. Thank you.
