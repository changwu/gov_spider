    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ As Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi meet today, Senator John Edwards issued the following statement calling for strong action against China for illegal currency manipulation:
"The Bush Administration should stop sitting on its hands and actually do something to save American jobs. We have known for years that China is manipulating its currency to boost its trade advantage with the United States, and working families are suffering.
"Because China is a member of the World Trade Organization, we have tools to use to hold China accountable for its currency manipulation. Once again, I call on President Bush to use his authority and end this unfair Chinese advantage. Simply pointing fingers at China cannot substitute for getting our own economy in order, but neither can we allow China to continue policies which harm American workers and the entire global trading system."
