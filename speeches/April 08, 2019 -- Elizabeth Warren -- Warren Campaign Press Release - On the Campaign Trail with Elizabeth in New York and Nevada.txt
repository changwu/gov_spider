Elizabeth isn't just talking about the big, structural change we need. She's building a movement and laying out a plan to actually make it happen.
Just look at the past few days on the campaign trail. At the National Action Network convention in New York City on Friday, she talked about why the fight for Universal Child Care is so personal for her — and so important for millions of families.
And she said that if Senate Republicans keep abusing the filibuster to stop us from getting anything done, we should get rid of the filibuster.


Later, she talked with grassroots donors at a pop-up event in Brooklyn, thanking them for supporting our campaign.


Then yesterday, Elizabeth held an organizing event in Reno, Nevada — taking questions, bringing people together, and staying to chat and take a picture with everyone who wanted one.


Elizabeth's only able to spend so much time at events like these — talking with people about real solutions to real problems — because she isn't holding any fancy fundraisers for wealthy donors behind closed doors.
If you like what you're seeing and hearing from Elizabeth on the campaign trail, you have the power to keep her voice strong in this race — chip in for the first time to power our grassroots movement.
