    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to title 2, United States Code, section 2a(a), I am transmitting the statement showing the apportionment population for each State as of April 1, 1990, and the number of Representatives to which each State would be entitled.
The population counts set forth herein are subject to possible correction for undercount or overcount. The Department of Commerce is considering whether to correct these counts and will publish corrected counts, if any, not later than July 15, 1991.
Sincerely,
George Bush
