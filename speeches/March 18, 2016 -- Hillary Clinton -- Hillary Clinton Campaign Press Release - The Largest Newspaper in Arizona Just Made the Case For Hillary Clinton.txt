Arizona's largest newspaper, the Arizona Republic, is backing Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Four days ahead of the state's primary, here's why they're urging Arizona voters to do the same:
Hillary has the most experience—and best judgment—of any candidate running for president.
"The point here is that Hillary Rodham Clinton has been doing this for a long time: seeing the world through a political lens and revealing an uncommon solidity of judgment and perspective. ...
"Not just because she has risen higher than any woman in American politics, but because she is by far the most experienced candidate of any of those running in either party this year. In fact, she is one of the most experienced people to ever run for president."
She has an unrivaled command of the issues—domestic and international.
"Clinton's record of achievement is long and storied. She was a top student in college who went on to Yale Law School and to practice law. She served as first lady in the Clinton White House with an ambition to tackle huge national and global problems—universal health care and women's rights. ...?
"Her relationships with world figures would be invaluable in framing America's outreach beyond our shores. She is reticent to put American troops on ground the in highly charged conflicts in the Middle East, preferring instead to leave the ground fighting to Middle Eastern allies."
She's never backed down from a tough fight.
"Few people engaged in the large policy debates of our land could withstand the kind of public scrutiny Clinton has endured during her near-lifetime of public service. ...?
"Her enemies, and they are legion, have sought to tear her down. But she is still standing, and on the cusp of the highest office in the land."
And to sum it up:


  " She has the mettle to be president. The sound judgment to be commander in chief."
