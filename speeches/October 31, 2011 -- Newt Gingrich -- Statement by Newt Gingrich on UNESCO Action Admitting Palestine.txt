    Atlanta, GAâ€“ Newt 2012 released the following statement today from presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, reacting to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) decision to admit Palestine as a member state:
"I condemn the decision of the UNESCO to admit Palestine as a member state, and applaud the State Department for immediately moving to cut off funding. This is a hostile action on the part of United Nations bureaucrats and the Palestinian leadership to circumvent the peace process with Israel illegitimately, and the United States must immediately cut off funding to any other UN entity that illegally recognizes Palestine."
"The vast anti-Israel faction at the United Nations will now try to use this vote as a first step toward full Palestinian recognition, giving voice to a government that counts terrorist organization Hamas as a key participant. The United States must be prepared to suspend all funding to the United Nations if the General Assembly moves to recognize a Palestinian state under the control of Hamas."
