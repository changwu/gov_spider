    The United States Government strongly and unequivocally condemns last night's criminal bombing of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. There have been two cowardly bomb attacks against foreign diplomatic missions in New York in the last week, both allegedly perpetrated by the same group, which calls itself Omega 7. (The Cuban Mission to the U.N. was also attacked on December 7.) We want to emphasize that the United States is totally committed to the carrying out of its responsibilities for the protection of foreign diplomats in the United States.
Ambassador McHenry has expressed the official regrets of the U.S. Government to the Soviet Permanent Representative to the U.N., and the Department of State has made a parallel statement of regret to the Soviet Charge d'Affaires. We shall do all in our power to see that such outrages are not repeated.
