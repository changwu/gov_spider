    Today, Biden for President released a new national ad featuring Bridgett Floyd, the sister of George Floyd, sharing her personal message about the power of standing up for change and voting this election in the wake of the tragic killing of her brother by law enforcement in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Today should have been George's 47th birthday. In "Change," airing nationally on television, radio, and digital outlets, Bridgett discusses how the Floyd family gathered for a conversation with Vice President Biden after George's death and highlights Vice President Biden's sincerity.
"We need a change, and we need it now," Bridgett said. "Biden is the change we need."
