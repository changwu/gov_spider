National Incident Commander Allen discussed the federal government’s authorization for BP to continue the well integrity test for another 24 hours, and reported on efforts to look for anomalies in pressure readings and the status of the relief well. Administrator Lubchenco discussed the potential for severe weather in the Gulf, which is being closely monitored. Secretary Chu wrapped up the briefing with an overview of the ongoing work by the federal science team to collect and analyze acoustic, sonar and seismic data. The President pushed his team to be prepared for any scenarios related to the potential development of a tropical storm in the Gulf.
