    Wilmington, DE - The Biden Campaign today announced the endorsements of several prominent former and current elected officials, leading members of law enforcement and key business leaders from throughout the state of South Carolina.
"These endorsements illustrate the depth and breadth of support that our campaign has received across the state of South Carolina," said Valerie Biden Owens, National Chairwoman of the Biden Campaign. "As most everyone acknowledges, the Democratic nominee will likely be decided by the four early voting states. To have this level of early support in this state puts us in a great position to win."
The endorsements announced today are in addition to those of Senator Gerald Malloy and Representative Jerry Govan, prominent members of the South Carolina State Legislature and Legislative Black Caucus, who joined Biden on the campaign trail during his two-day trip to the state where they also officially announced their endorsements of him.
