    I'm pleased that Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate are working together to get a bipartisan comprehensive energy billâ€”let me start over. I'm pleased that Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate are working together to get a comprehensive immigration bill.
I want to thank the efforts of those involved in the process. I appreciate their understanding there needs to be a comprehensive immigration bill. I recognize there are still details to be worked out. I would encourage the Members to work hard to get the bill done prior to the upcoming break.
Thank you all.
