Democrats are trying to block Trump's judge picks with vile, hypocritical smears

Democrats and the liberal media are slamming President Trump for packing federal courts with supposedly "unfit" judges. Nonsense. Trump's nominees have impressive credentials.
...
Look for fireworks in the Senate Wednesday, when the American Bar Association tries to justify rating several of Trump's nominees "not qualified." Such ABA ratings are a political hit job masquerading as high-minded objectivity.
Consider the ABA's "not qualified" rating of Leonard Steven Grasz, a Nebraska attorney nominated to the appeals court.
One complaint: During 11 years as Nebraska's chief deputy attorney general, he defended many of the state's laws, including a ban on partial-birth abortion. But defending that law was his job.
...
Opposing any limit on abortion is enough to outrage pro-choice activist Cynthia Nance, the law professor who led Grasz's recent ABA review.
...
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) argues "there's simply no way to prevent a judge's .?.?. personal beliefs from influencing" rulings.
...
To Democrats like Whitehouse, it's not about credentials but agendas â€” and only nominees with left-wing agendas are acceptable.
Not Brett Talley. Last Thursday, Talley won Senate Judiciary Committee approval to serve on an Alabama district court despite the ABA's claim that Talley lacks "requisite trial experience" and is "unqualified."
...
He's got about as much trial experience as Justice Elena Kagan, who got a "well qualified" rating when President Barack Obama nominated her to the highest court.
What's Talley's real problem? His political views and Trump connections.
...
Amy Barrett, nominated to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, got hammered for her Catholicism. Feinstein suggested Barrett's religion "lives loudly within" her, making her unfit.
...
Millions voted for Trump because he pledged to appoint judges who would uphold the Constitution, not invent law to advance a social agenda. But the ABA and other activists aren't surrendering their grip on the courts without a fight. Remember that when you hear the smears about "unfit" nominees.
