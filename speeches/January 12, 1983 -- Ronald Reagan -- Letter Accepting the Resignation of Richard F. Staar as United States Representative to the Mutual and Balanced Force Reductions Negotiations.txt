    Dear Dick:
It is with great regret that I accept your resignation as U.S. Representative to the Mutual and Balanced Forces Reduction Talks.
Your efforts to implement the arms control objectives of this Administration have been appreciated, especially your work on the concept of a draft treaty which NATO tabled for the first time in Vienna last July.
You have served honorably and worked hard in support of our policies, and all of us owe you a debt of gratitude.
Thank you for your loyal and dedicated service. You may be sure you have my best wishes for every success.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
Dear Mr. President:

Respectfully submitted,
RICHARD F. STAAR
