    I commend the House for passing legislation that will help ensure the safety of the traveling public by strengthening security at America's airports. I am pleased the bill includes many of the safety measures proposed by my administration, including strong Federal oversight of airline security, an expanded Federal air marshals program, and important aircraft security enhancements.
The American people deserve tough security standards, and the House plan delivers. I urge the House and Senate to quickly work together to send a strong and effective bill to my desk.
