    Today Massachusetts State Rep. Lenny Mirra announced his support for Ohio Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign.
Said Mirra, "Governor Kasich has the experience and the record of accomplishments that is head and shoulders above all other candidates. As a homeowner, parent and small businessman, I know that's exactly the kind of leadership we need in the White House. I am proud to endorse John Kasich for president."

Mirra, a resident of West Newbury, has represented the 2nd Essex District in the Massachusetts House since 2013, serving constituents in Georgetown, Groveland, Merrimac, Newbury and West Newbury as well as precincts of Boxford and Haverhill. A graduate of Boston College, he is also the manager of Mirra Company, Inc., a family-owned utility construction company based in Georgetown.
Said Kasich, "I am grateful to Rep. Lenny Mirra for his endorsement. As an influential Republican legislator and respected business owner in his community, his support and advice will help us expand our outreach to voters and other community leaders in these critical weeks before the primary election."
