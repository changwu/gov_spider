    Governor Nikki Haley today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"In choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney has confirmed that he intends to run a campaign based on ideas to challenge a President who has no new ideas, is running away from his record, and is relying instead on smears, distractions, and demagoguery. That's a failing strategy and a Romney-Ryan ticket is going to prevail against it."
