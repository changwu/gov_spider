    The United States congratulates the European Union on the sixtieth anniversary of the 1957 Treaties of Rome and the founding of the European Economic Community. Our two continents share the same values and, above all, the same commitment to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. Together we look forward to another sixty years and more of shared security and shared prosperity.
