    I am pleased to sign into law S. 2055, an act to establish a reservation for the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon.
Early in my administration I signed into law the Siletz Indian Restoration Act of 1977, restoring Federal acknowledgment of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and making them eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States for Indians. Section 7 of that act provided for the establishment of a reservation for the tribe and required the administration to submit to the Congress within 2 years a plan for the establishment of the reservation.
S. 2055 reflects this administration's plan and strikes a balance among the interests of the tribe and those of the local community, the State of Oregon, and the Federal Government. Most of the lands to be conveyed to the tribe under the act are timberlands. They also include an important area which would permit the tribe to centralize its facilities and activities in a place to which the tribe has strong historical, cultural, and emotional ties.
All parties involvedâ€”officials of the administration, of the tribe, and of the State and local governments of Oregon are to be commended for their fine spirit of cooperation. I want to specially commend Congressman Les AuCoin and Senator Mark Hatfield for their leadership in this endeavor.
It is with pleasure that I sign S. 2055.
