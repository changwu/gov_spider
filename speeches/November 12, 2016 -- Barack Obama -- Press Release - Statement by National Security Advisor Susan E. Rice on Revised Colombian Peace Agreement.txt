    The United States congratulates the Government of Colombia on reaching a revised peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. This progress is a testament to the commitment shown by all sides, including those who did not support the original accord, to ending this 52-year conflict and building a just and lasting peace in Colombia. We commend President Juan Manuel Santos for forming an inclusive national dialogue to incorporate into this revised agreement concerns of those who voted against the initially proposed peace agreement. We appreciate how difficult and complicated the negotiations have been and recognize that the new provisions, while an important step forward, will not necessarily satisfy everyone. For our part, we intend to continue the United States' bipartisan support to Colombia through the Peace Colombia framework to assist implementation of the peace accord, as well as the Global Demining Initiative for Colombia, which the United States co-sponsors with the Kingdom of Norway.
