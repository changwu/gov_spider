    "After nearly four years in office, President Obama's foreign policy is unraveling and America's safety and security is threatened. Iran is marching toward nuclear weapons capability and mobs have threatened our embassies abroad. And while our enemies have grown stronger, the President has left our nation's closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, increasingly isolated. As president, Mitt Romney will restore our nation's leadership in the world and reverse President Obama's policies of weakness and decline." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
President Obama's Foreign Policy Is Unraveling In The Middle East And America's Security Is Threatened Throughout The World
President Obama, On His Foreign Policy In The Middle East: "I Was Pretty Certain And Continue To Be Pretty Certain That There Are Going To Be Bumps In The Road..." KROFT: "Have the events that took place in the Middle East, the recent events in the Middle East given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the Arab Spring?" OBAMA: "Well, I'd said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path. ... But I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because-- you know, in a lot of these places-- the one organizing principle-- has been Islam." (CBS's "60 Minutes," 9/23/12)
Recent Unrest In The Middle East Has Called "Into Question Central Tenets" Of President Obama's Middle East Policies. "The upheaval over an anti-Islam video has suddenly become Mr. Obama's most serious foreign policy crisis of the election season, and analysts say it is calling into question central tenets of his Middle East policy. Did he do enough throughout the Arab Spring to help the transition to democracy from autocracy? Has he drawn a hard enough line against Islamic extremists? Did his administration fail to address security concerns? Has his outreach to the Muslim world yielded any lasting benefits?" (Peter Baker and Mark Landler, "U.S. Is Preparing For A Long Siege Of Arab Unrest," The New York Times, 9/15/12)
"The White House Is Girding Itself For An Extended Period Of Turmoil That Will Test The Security Of American Diplomatic Missions..."

Although the tumult subsided Saturday, senior administration officials said they had concluded that the sometimes violent protests in Muslim countries may presage a period of sustained instability with unpredictable diplomatic and political consequences."

(Mark Landler, "Shifting Reports On Libya Killings May Cost Obama," The New York Times, 9/28/12)
  

President Obama "Has Been Roundly Criticized For Lacking An Overall Strategy" In The Middle East.

But Obama and his staff have repeatedly warned of the dangers of the perception that the United States is intervening in Arab countries." (Sam Youngman, "Obama Considering 'Targeted Sanctions,' Against Syria," The Hill, 4/25/11)
For Weeks, The Obama Administration Has Struggled To Offer Consistent Accounts Of The Terrorist Attack On Our Diplomatic Mission In Libya:
For Weeks Following The Terrorist Attacks In Libya, President Obama And His Advisers Offered "Shifting Accounts Of The Fatal Attacks." "The Obama administration's shifting accounts of the fatal attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, have left President Obama suddenly exposed on national security and foreign policy, a field where he had enjoyed a seemingly unassailable advantage over Mitt Romney in the presidential race." (Mark Landler, "Shifting Reports On Libya Killings May Cost Obama," The New York Times, 9/28/12)

Clapper Jr., to issue a statement on Friday acknowledging that American intelligence agencies 'revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.'"

In fact, every aspect of the early account — peddled most prominently by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice — has unraveled." (Editorial, "Shifting Libya Attack Story Raises Red Flags," USA Today, 10/1/12)
President Obama's Foreign Policy Failures Have Left Iran Emboldened And Moving Toward Nuclear Weapon Capability:

(Matt Spetalnick and Mark Felsenthal, "Obama Warns Iran On Nuclear Bid, Containment 'No Option'," Reuters, 9/25/12)
Iran Has Succeeded In "Adding Thousands Of Centrifuge Machines To Its Underground Facility" And Has Grown Its Uranium Stockpile. "No firm dates for new negotiations have been set, and Middle East analysts say no breakthrough is likely until after the November election. Meanwhile, Iran's success in adding thousands of centrifuge machines to its underground facility — and the inexorable growth of its uranium stockpile — continues to stoke fears of an Israeli airstrike. It has also left the White House vulnerable to Republican charges that administration policies, while well-intentioned, have ultimately been fruitless."

The Washington Post: "The Result Is That President Obama Is Not Even Leading From Behind On Iran; He Is Simply Behind."

(Editorial, "More Half-Measures From Obama Administration On Iran," The Washington Post, 11/22/11)

They're one of our closest allies in the region. And we've got an Iranian regime that has said horrible things that directly threaten Israel's existence." (CBS's "60 Minutes," 9/23/12)

The maneuver triggered booing by delegates in Time Warner Cable Arena and raised questions about how President Obama's campaign overlooked the omissions in the drafting process..."
