AD FACTS: Script For "Broken" (TV :60)
ANNCR: Washington's broken. John McCain knows it. We're worse off than we were four years ago. Only McCain has taken on big tobacco, drug companies, fought corruption in both parties.
The New York Times' David Brooks: "McCain Has Fought One Battle After Another Against Lobbyists And Special Interests." (David Brooks, Op-Ed, "The Real McCain," The New York Times, 2/26/08)
Public Citizen's Joan Claybrook: "John McCain has fought for 14 long, hard years for reforms that seriously limit lobbyists' power ... He has fought for campaign finance reform, limits on gifts and travel from lobbyists, and extensive public disclosure of lobbyists' activities all of which limit the influence of lobbyists and the companies that hire lobbyists in Washington, D.C." (Public Citizen, "One Thing Overlooked In Flap Over McCain And Lobbyists: His Record On Reform," Press Release, 2/26/08)
The Boston Globe: "McCain Took On The Tobacco Industry." "Ten years ago, Senator John McCain took on the tobacco industry, saying he would never back down from legislation to regulate the industry. ... McCain's decade of work on tobacco, one of the most significant efforts of his congressional career, has earned him enmity from the industry and from some fellow Republicans over the years." (Michael Kranish, "McCain's Stand On Tobacco Is Put To Test," The Boston Globe, 3/26/08)
McCain's Championing Of Anti-Smoking Legislation "Faced Furious Opposition From The Tobacco Lobby." "In 1998, McCain championed anti-smoking legislation that faced furious opposition from the tobacco lobby. McCain guided the legislation through the Senate Commerce Committee on a 19-1 vote, but then the tobacco companies struck back. They hired 200 lobbyists and spent $40 million in advertising (three times as much as the Harry and Louise health care reform ads). Many of the ads attacked McCain by name, accusing him of becoming a big government liberal. After weeks of bitter debate, the bill died on the Senate floor." (David Brooks, Op-Ed, "The Real McCain," The New York Times, 2/26/08)
In 2004, John McCain Co-Sponsored Bipartisan Drug Reimportation Legislation. "At a press conference today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) introduced breakthrough bipartisan, consensus prescription drug reimportation legislation, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, with Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), John McCain (R-AZ), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Tom Daschle (D-SD), Trent Lott (R-MS) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI)." (Sen. Olympia Snowe, Press Release, 4/21/04)
John McCain Fought To Allow The Importation Of Cheaper Drugs Which Was "Adamantly Opposed By Industry Lobbyists."

(Eamon Javers, "Is John McCain Good For Business?" Business Week Online, 2/7/08)
A John McCain Bill To Make It Easier For Cheap Generic Drugs To Come Onto The Market Drew "Strong Opposition From The Pharmaceutical Industry." "The most public front was active last week, with the Senate passing a bill intended to make it easier for cheap generic drugs to come onto the market. The bill, sponsored by Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., drew considerable support in Congress and strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry." ("Insurers' 'Counter' Attacks Aim To Boost Generic Drugs," Grand Rapid Press, 8/11/02)
McCain Passed Campaign Finance Reform Which "Was A Direct Assault On Lobbyist Power." "In 2002, McCain capped his long push for campaign finance reform by passing the McCain-Feingold Act. People can argue about the effectiveness of the act, but one thing is beyond dispute. It was a direct assault on lobbyist power, and earned McCain undying enmity among many important parts of the Republican coalition, who felt their soft money influence was being diminished." (David Brooks, Op-Ed, "The Real McCain," The New York Times, 2/26/08)

John McCain Will Be Vigilant In Holding Corporate Abuses To Account. "Americans are right to be offended when extravagant CEO salaries and severance deals bear no relation to their company's success or shareholders' wishes. As president, John McCain will see that wrongdoing of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors. Under his reforms, all aspects of a CEO's pay, including severance arrangements, must be approved by shareholders." (John McCain 2008, "A Leader We Can Believe In To Help Small Businesses," Press Release, 6/11/08)

"Congress already has several investigations underway to examine this kind of wagering in our energy markets, unrelated to any kind of productive commerce, because it can distort the market, drive prices beyond rational limits, and put the investments and pensions of millions of Americans at risk. John McCain believes that where we find abuses, they need to be swiftly punished. To make sure it never happens again, we must reform the laws and regulations governing the oil futures market, so that they are just as clear and effective as the rules applied to stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments." (John McCain 2008, "Securing Our Energy Future," Press Release, 6/17/08)
