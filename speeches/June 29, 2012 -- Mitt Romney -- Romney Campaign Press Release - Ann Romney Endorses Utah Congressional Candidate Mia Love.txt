    Ann Romney today announced her support for Utah Congressional candidate Mia Love.
"Women across the country are concerned for our children's futures," said Ann Romney. "Will our children be able to find jobs and will they be faced with burdensome debt? Mia's record of reducing spending and making government more accountable to the taxpayers should be an example for Washington. With leaders like her, we can help ensure that our children and grandchildren have bright futures."
"I am honored to have Ann's support," said Mia Love. "She understands the importance of fostering an environment for job creation and making government more responsible. These are the same principles that I have fought for as mayor and as a councilwoman, and they are the same principles that I will bring to Washington."
