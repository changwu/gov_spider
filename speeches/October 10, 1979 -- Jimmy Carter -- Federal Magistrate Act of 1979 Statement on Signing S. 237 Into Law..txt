    I have today signed the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979. This act will expand the jurisdiction of United States magistrates in both civil and criminal cases, and will ensure that magistrates are appointed on merit. It will also improve the capabilities and efficiency of the Federal court system, while at the same time preserving parties' rights and reducing the expense of litigation.
I congratulate Congressmen Kastenmeier, Rodino, and Railsback, and Senators DeConcini, Kennedy, and Thurmond for their leadership on this bill. Without their able efforts its passage would not have been possible.
On February 27 of this year, I sent a message to Congress in which I supported six judicial reform measures to increase the efficiency, cut the cost, and maintain the integrity of the Federal court system. The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 is the first of these six measures to have passed Congress. I ask the Congress to act promptly on the remaining measures, which will benefit our Federal court system and the public.
