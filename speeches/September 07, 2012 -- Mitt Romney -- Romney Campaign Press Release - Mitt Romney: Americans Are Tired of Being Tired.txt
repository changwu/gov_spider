MITT ROMNEY: "Now I know that today, a number of you would come away with heavy hearts because we've had a lot of bad news lately. We've seen, over the last three and a half years, a lot of bad news. Americans are tired of being tired. These have been tough times. And just today, another report came out on the jobs front. Another disappointing, sad report. There were four times as many people who dropped out of the workforce as the net new jobs created under this president. And it's not just a one month figure. The White House has, I think now, for 31 straight months said, 'well, just don't look at the monthly numbers. Monthly numbers aren't that critical.' Well, if you take thirty months and put them together, that's pretty critical. And you see what's happened across this country, the American people had expected the President to deliver on his promises because at the convention, four years ago, he laid out a lot of promises. He said that he'd create jobs and instead we have unemployment now still over 8 percent for 43 straight months. He said by now it would be down to 5.4 percent."
