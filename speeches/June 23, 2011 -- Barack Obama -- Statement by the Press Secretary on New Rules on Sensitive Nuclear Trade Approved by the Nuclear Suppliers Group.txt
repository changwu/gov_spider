    The United States welcomes the decision of the 46-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to approve new guidelines covering transfers of sensitive nuclear technologies used for the enrichment of uranium or the processing of spent nuclear fuel. This decision establishes agreed criteria that limit allowed transfers only to those nations in compliance with their nonproliferation obligations and that meet agreed standards for nuclear safeguards, safety and security. This Administration remains committed to ensuring that nations in good standing can have access to peaceful nuclear energy without increasing the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation. This latest step, coupled with the agreement last December to establish an International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear fuel bank, advances the President's nuclear agenda laid out in Prague in 2009. It further demonstrates the clear determination of nations to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime and build new frameworks for civil nuclear cooperation.
