    Today, USA Today published an op-ed by Anne Zimmerman, a small business owner, in which she argues that small businesses owners support President Biden's proposal to pay his infrastructure investments by taxing the wealthy their fair share.
Zimmerman writes: "Despite what â€¦ critics would have you believe, many small business owners welcome the investment in our infrastructure because of the economic benefits it will deliver. And they, like most other Americans, want to see corporations and the wealthy chip in more."
She continues: "Most small businesses are not taxed as corporations, and their owners are not wealthy. They are largely members of the middle class. And the assertion that taxing the wealthy hurts investment in small business is another version of the theory of trickle-down economics often deployed to protect the rich."
