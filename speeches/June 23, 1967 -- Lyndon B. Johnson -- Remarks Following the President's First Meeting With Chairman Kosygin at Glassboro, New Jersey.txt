    The Chairman and I have met since we arrived here a little after 11 today.
Our meeting gave us an opportunity to get acquainted with each other. We have exchanged views on a number of international questions.
Among these problems were the Middle East, Vietnam, and the question of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
We agreed that it is now very important to reach international agreement on a nonproliferation treaty.
We also exchanged views on the questions of direct bilateral relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.
Finally, we agreed that discussions on these questions should be continued in New York between Secretary Rusk and Mr. Gromyko during next week.
This meeting today was a very good and very useful meeting. We are in the debt of the great Governor of New Jersey for his hospitality.
We are inviting ourselves to return here again at 1:30 on Sunday afternoon. We will continue our discussions here then. Those of you who have Sunday afternoon off, we will be glad to have you come, too.
