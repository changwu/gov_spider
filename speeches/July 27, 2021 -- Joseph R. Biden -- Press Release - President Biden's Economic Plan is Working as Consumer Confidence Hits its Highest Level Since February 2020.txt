    President Biden's economic plan is working. The Consumer Confidence Index – a measure of consumers' assessments of the economy – is at its highest level since February 2020. The Index increased to 129.1 in July, exceeding consensus expectations. The latest increase in July marks the sixth straight month of gains, as Americans continue to feel the results of President Biden's historic economic and health plans.
According to the Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, "Q3 is off to a strong start. Consumers' optimism about the short-term outlook didn't waver, and they continued to expect that business conditions, jobs, and personal financial prospects will improve."
It's clear that President Biden's economic plan is working – and consumers agree.
