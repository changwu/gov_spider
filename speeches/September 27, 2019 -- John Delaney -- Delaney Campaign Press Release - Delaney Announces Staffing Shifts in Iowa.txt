    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD - The Delaney campaign releases the following statement:
Brent Roske will become State Director of Iowa as the campaign ramps up its focus on rural Iowa. Brent brings a broad range of experience to the campaign, including media and production capability, which will be very helpful to the recently announced Heartland StartUp Tour.
"The Heartland StartUp Tour is a great way for Iowans to meet John in a business setting where he started his career and I'm excited to be the new Iowa State Director for the campaign to help create this initiative," said Brent Roske.
Xan Fishman, Campaign Manager, added:
"We appreciate the work Monica Biddix has done on the campaign and we wish her the best in all of her future endeavors, but we are excited about the focus and expertise Brent will bring to the campaign, particularly with our new Heartland StartUp Tour and showing Iowans that John's not just a smart, truth-telling policy wonk; he's also a former Entrepreneur-of-the-Year and is the only Democrat in the field who has both real-world experience in business and in Congress."
