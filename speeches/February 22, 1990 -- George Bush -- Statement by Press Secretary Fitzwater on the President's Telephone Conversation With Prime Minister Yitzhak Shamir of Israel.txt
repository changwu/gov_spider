    Prime Minister Shamir of Israel phoned the President this morning. The Prime Minister thanked the President for U.S. support of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, for opposing anti-Semitism, and for supporting the restoration of diplomatic relations as well as the establishment of direct flights between the U.S.S.R. and Israel. The President said that the United States would continue to support these policies.
The Prime Minister stated that Jewish immigration into Israel was a separate matter from the question of settlements and that the Israeli Government had no policy of directing where the new immigrants would live. The President thanked the Prime Minister for his statement and said that the United States would continue to support free emigration from the Soviet Union. At the same time, the President reiterated U.S. opposition to any settlement activity. The President also expressed his hope that the peace process could move forward so that the U.S., Israeli, and Egyptian foreign ministers could meet and that a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian delegations would take place in Cairo soon.
The President expressed his appreciation to the Prime Minister for his call, which both leaders described as helpful and constructive.
