    I was surprised by the news reports that have said my endorsement last evening of the Vice President was "lukewarm." I am enthusiastic, fully committed and, as I have said, will go all out to make Vice President Bush the next President of the United States. George has been a partner in all we have accomplished, and he should be elected. He has my full confidence and my total support. I will campaign actively on his behalf.
