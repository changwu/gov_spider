  A Proclamation

The success of the National School Lunch Program-now in its 29th year-reaffirms those qualities which we, as a people, have exhibited for the past 200 years.
Our awareness, our concern, our willingness to work together for a common good have preserved and enriched this Nation. Today, these same qualities are ensuring the health and well-being of our country's children and youth.
The National School Lunch Program is a product of the awareness and cooperation of parents, teachers and civic groups. It is also an outstanding example of cooperation between people at Federal, State and local levels.
Recognizing the importance of their activities and the good which this program does our Nation, Congress, by a joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (76 Stat. 779, 36 U.S.C. 168), designated the week beginning the second Sunday in October each year as National School Lunch Week. The President has been requested to annually issue a proclamation calling for observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe the week of October 12, 1975, as National School Lunch Week and to give special attention to activities which will focus on good nutrition for our young people.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.

GERALD R. FORD
