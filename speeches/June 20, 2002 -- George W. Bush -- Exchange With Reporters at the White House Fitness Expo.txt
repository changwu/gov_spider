    President's Workout
Q. Have you worked out today, sir?
The President. This afternoon. As you know, I'm giving a speech tonight, the Sullivan speech. So after working all day long, before the speech, I'll work out. I'm going to lift weights. I'm going to do a little elliptical training. I'm going to do some physical fitness stuffâ€”not an outdoor run today.
Upcoming Speech on the Middle East
Q. How's the other speech coming?
The President. The speech I'm giving tonight?
Q. No, the other one.
The President. I'll give it at the appropriate time. Thank you all.
