    The Clinton campaign announced today the endorsement of Congressman Dennis Cardoza (CA-18) and named him Co-Chair of its National Hispanic Leadership Council.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring about the change that our country so desperately needs," said Congressman Cardoza. "Her time as First Lady and as a two term U.S. Senator uniquely prepares her to be President from day one. There is no doubt that she will work tirelessly for the underserved," he added.
Cardoza represents California's 18th Congressional District, which includes Merced County and portions of San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Madera, and Fresno Counties. In 2007, he joined the prestigious House Rules Committee, and also serves as Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture. Congressman Cardoza has been a strong and consistent advocate for reducing our nation's dangerous dependence on foreign oil and he strongly supports investing in alternative and renewable energy sources.
Prior to serving in Congress, Cardoza spent six years in the California State Assembly, where he chaired the powerful Rules Committee and helped forge the Moderate Democratic Caucus. A broad group of organizations honored Cardoza as Legislator of the Year for his efforts to help family farms, and promote education and children's safety.
"I'm honored to have earned the support of Congressman Cardoza," said Senator Clinton. "With his help, we will continue to bring our message of change across the country."
