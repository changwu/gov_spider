    The President is pleased to approve the U.S.-India Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation (also known as the 123 Agreement). The conclusion of this agreement, which completes the U.S-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative, has been a priority for both President Bush and Prime Minister Singh, and strengthens the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership.
This historic achievement will bolster international nonproliferation efforts, provide economic and business opportunities in both countries, and help India address its growing energy needs in an environmentally responsible manner. The President looks forward to working with Congress to ensure passage on the agreement this year.
The President also looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Singh to the White House on September 25, 2008, to strengthen the Strategic Partnership and build upon our progress in other areas of cooperation, such as agriculture, education, trade, and defense.
