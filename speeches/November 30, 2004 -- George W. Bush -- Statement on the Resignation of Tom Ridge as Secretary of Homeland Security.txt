    Tom Ridge has been a key member of my Cabinet, working to help make America safer and stronger. As the Nation's first Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and first Secretary of Homeland Security, he oversaw the most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government in 50 years. His efforts have resulted in safer skies, increased border and port security, and enhanced measures to safeguard our critical infrastructure and the American public. In the fight against terrorism, he has played a vital role in protecting the American people from a real and ongoing threat.
Tom has served America for decades, including as a decorated Army soldier, as a United States Congressman, and as Governor of Pennsylvania. He is a long-time friend, and I thank him for his leadership and dedicated service to our country. America is safer and our Government is better able to protect our people because of his hard work. I wish him and Michele all the best.
