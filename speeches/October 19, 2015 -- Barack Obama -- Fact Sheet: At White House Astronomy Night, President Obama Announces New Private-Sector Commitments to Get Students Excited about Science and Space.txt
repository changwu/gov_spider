Marking Six Years of Discovery and Accomplishment in Space
This week, NASA is celebrating Exoplanet Week, which celebrates the remarkable discoveries of exoplanets that have been made in recent years. With the recent discovery of Kepler 452b, "Earth's bigger, older cousin," worlds that used to be considered science fiction are drawing closer to fact. Indeed, just over 20 years ago, it was uncertain whether there were any other planets outside our solar system that orbited other stars. Now, astronomers believe there is at least one distant world for every star in the sky.
Because of this Administration's investments, which include the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the James Webb Space Telescope (both scheduled to launch in the next few years), NASA's fleet of powerful observatories will peer even deeper into the universe. In addition, the Administration's investments over past six years are yielding progress across the President's outlined space priorities: These include:
•      Journey to Mars. The Administration's investments in space technology development and the Asteroid Redirect Mission are key to developing the capacity for a future human mission to Mars. NASA's current science missions are already providing important insight into the Red Planet. For example, the roving Mars Science Lab, Curiosity, which landed in August 2012, continues to produce a scientific treasure trove of data providing new understanding of the history of that planet's surface, including definitive proof that water once flowed there. Also, the MAVEN mission, which began orbiting Mars last September, is providing unprecedented insights into the history of the Martian atmosphere.
•      Space Technology. Investments in advanced technologies have improved U.S. capabilities in areas that could revolutionize exploration missions and help U.S. industry. For example, improved deployable space solar arrays, demonstrated with funding from the Space Technology Mission Directorate, are now being leveraged by U.S. commercial satellite manufacturers and NASA missions.
•      Earth Science and Climate. Today, NASA is launching a new website so the world can see images of the full, sunlit side of the Earth every day. The images are taken by a NASA camera one million miles away on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Air Force. In addition, NASA has successfully launched five Earth-science missions in the past 20 months.
•      International Space Station. The International Space Station will mark 15 years of humans continuously living in space on November 2. Orbiting 250 miles above the Earth, astronauts aboard the station are conducting research not possible on the ground, like the one-year mission with astronaut Scott Kelly. The space station also is facilitating the growth of a robust commercial market in low-Earth orbit for research, technology development, and crew and cargo transportation.
•      Commercial Space Industry. NASA's support has helped to create a burgeoning U.S. private space sector. Two private providers, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, are delivering cargo to the ISS, and contracts were signed late last year with SpaceX and Boeing for transport of astronauts to the ISS on U.S. rockets by 2017. In addition, NASA has named four astronauts – all of whom will be participating in the Astronomy Night event – to train to fly orbital flight tests in Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft.
