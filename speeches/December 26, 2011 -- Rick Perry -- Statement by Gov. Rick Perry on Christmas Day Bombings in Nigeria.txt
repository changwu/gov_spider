    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement condemning the terrorist attacks on Christian churches in Nigeria on Christmas Day:
"These attacks are designed to strike at the foundation of a civil society by massacring innocent civilians at worship. These savage acts are part of a disturbing trend of attacks on Christians extending from Nigeria to Egypt to Iraq. Americans should not be afraid to express solidarity with these Christian communities, and to recognize their persecution for the evil that it is.
"The United States should stand with our allies to support the Nigerian government in the aftermath of the attacks. The terrorist activities of Boko Haram are particularly worrisome for the United States because of the organization's affiliation with Al Qaeda. Through this connection, Boko Haram may eventually threaten not only the people of Nigeria who wish to live free under the democratic rule of law, but also free peoples everywhere. Even after the death of Osama bin Laden we must remain vigilant about the danger Al Qaeda-related networks pose to us, and fashion our policy in Africa accordingly."
