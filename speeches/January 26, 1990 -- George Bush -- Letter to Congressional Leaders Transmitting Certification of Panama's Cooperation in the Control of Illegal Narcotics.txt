    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
I am transmitting to you my certification that Panama is fully cooperating with us on the war on drugs. In addressing the urgent issues connected with rebuilding virtually every aspect of Panamanian society since coming into office, the Government of President Guillermo Endara has made the war against drugs a centerpiece of its program. Panamanian leaders have demonstrated their commitment by cooperating in returning Manuel Noriega to face trial in the United States, by freezing hundreds of bank accounts at U.S. request, and by concluding a comprehensive narcotics control agreement with us.
I am convinced that the Panamanian people and their government recognize that it is in their direct national interest to end their association with the scourge of drugs. I have firmly concluded that the vital national interests of the United States require that assistance and benefits be provided to Panama, and that the United States support multilateral development bank assistance to that country.
I therefore urge you to enact a joint resolution approving my determination immediately.
Sincerely,
George Bush
