    We are deeply concerned about reports that in 2001, some unidentified portions of remains from the 9/11 attacks were disposed of in a landfill, and about the unacceptable handling of remains at Dover. The President has been briefed on the independent review of Dover Port Mortuary and strongly supports the Pentagon's efforts to make needed systemic structural changes so that these types of incidents never happen again. The United States has a solemn obligation to compassionately and professionally care for fallen service members and their families, and those we tragically lost on 9/11.
