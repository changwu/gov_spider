    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Annunzio (D) Illinois and one other)
The Administration urges that H.R. 4529 be brought to the floor under regular, order to permit the deletion of section 2. This section w.ould effectively remove the Mint's numismatic program from the sequestration requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
The Administration believes that attempts to exempt additional programs from sequestration must be strenuously resisted in order to prevent a flood of requests for similar treatment in other programs.
