    We welcome this announcement that some of the Americans held in the Embassy in Tehran will be released. We are thankful the ordeal may be over for them and that they may be soon reunited with their families.
We strongly urge that the authorities in Iran now move to secure the safe release of all those still being held. Their ordeal is not over. The United States Government will continue to work in every channel open to it to achieve that end.
