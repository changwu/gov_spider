Travel pool report #2 - Arrival at the G20 venue 
After an uneventful ride in the streets of Rome, which let us catch a glimpse of the Foro Traiano and other landmarks of the Eternal City, the motorcade reached La Nuvola (« the cloud »), the convention center where the G20 summit is taking place, at 11.34 AM.

Travel pool report #3 - G20/Details about arrival, family photo, plenary 
Rome, Italy
Many thanks to co-pooler Annie Linskey (Washington Post), who shares this about the arrival of POTUS at La Nuvola, where the G20 summit is taking place.
The convention center, a rectangular glass building encasing a cloud-like structure, is located in "EUR/Esposizione Universale Romana", a neighborhood created by Benito Mussolini to glorify his fascist regime.
The president was greeted by the Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi at 11:33 am. Draghi walked towards Biden, they chatted briefly on the red carpet then walked up to a platform where they posed for photos.
POTUS arrived around 11:40 am for the family photo, he was standing on the far left near the French president Emmanuel Macron, who greeted him warmly.
UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the final leader to arrive for the photos. First responders were brought in, and several of them took selfies with Biden at the end.
Pool then moved to the spray at top of the first plenary session of this G20 summit. Biden was already there when pool arrived at 11:53 am.
POTUS stood near his seat at a massive table shaped in an oval shaped ring. Biden sat down at his chair and looked briefly at a white folder. He then chatted with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who had a desk behind him. Then the president walked over toward Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and whispered something that pool could not hear.
Pool was asked to leave at 11:57 am.
According to photos taken before the pool arrived, the president also interacted briefly with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UK's Boris Johnson.

Travel pool report #4 Plenary wraps 
Onpassing from the WH
On background as a SAO:The President just wrapped up plenary one. Most of the Leaders were in person with others there virtually. The Leaders all came out in support of a global minimum tax. The President emphasized the importance of this historic deal during his intervention. The President also mentioned that while we don't see eye to eye on every issue, we can tackle shared interests.
The President underscored his commitment to ending the global pandemic and securing an inclusive global economic recovery, including by supporting developing countries through debt relief and strengthening reallocation of SDRs. He reminded G20 Leaders that new pandemics can arise any time so it is important that we strengthen global health systems and do more to create the global health security infrastructure to make sure we are prepared against the next pandemic.
The President stressed the need for balanced, well supplied, and competitive global energy markets so we don't undermine this critical moment of economic recovery.

Travel pool report #5 - Spray on top of Iran meeting 
Shortly before 4 pm the pool was brought to a corner in the convention center where the president was standing with Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, UK's Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron.
The four leaders posed for photos in front of flags before having a meeting about returning to negotiations with Iran on the nuclear program.
Asked when he would like the talks to resume, Biden seemed to answer but your pool was standing far away and it was difficult to hear.
Will try to get a clean quote.

Travel pool report #12a - SAO briefing, more quotes 
Here are more quotes from a background briefing with a Senior Administration official on Rome.Many thanks to copooler Annie Linskey from the Washington Post
SAO said Biden will have a bilateral meeting "tomorrow morning" with president Erdogan of Turkey.
SAO said that if Erdogan had followed through on his recent threat to expel diplomats the bilat would have been in jeopardy.
"I'm not actually even sure we would have had the meeting if he had gone ahead and expelled," the SAO said.
"certainly the President will indicate that we need to find a way to avoid crises like that one going forward," the SAO said about the threat. "Precipitous action is not going to benefit the US Turkey partnership and alliance."
The SAO said the following topics will be covered: Syria, Libya, Turkey's desire for various defense systems including the s400 system and the country's ambition to acquire F16s.
Also mentioned POTUS had a "brief" meeting today with chancellor Merkel and vice-chancellor Olaf Scholz. It was an "opportunity" for POTUS to speak with Scholdz who is trying to form a government right now.
SAO told us that today the president "raised the issue of energy prices" and "made the point that we need to see adequate supply of energy in this moment as we make the long term transition to a carbon free economy."
"we're using this opportunity with all of the world's key energy consumers to do some intensive consultations about how we see the current picture and then to talk about how we can all effectively advocate to OPEC plus to do the needful when it comes to supply and then if they don't, what could come next has begun to be a topic of conversation."
The SAO did not share more details, saying: "I don't want to front run that."
On supply chain issues the president will make "a couple of announcements" about "our own national stockpile of critical minerals and metals" among other things. He will ask world leaders to work together to resolve the bottlenecks and to increase transparency.
on China said US "found strong convergence" with leaders of Europe "on the nature of the challenge"
In a meeting about Iran today POTUS had a "very detailed" conversation with Merkel, Macron and Johnson. President has "conviction" that "diplomatic solution is the best solution" to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
"We would like them to begin as urgently as possible" he said about these talks.
At this meeting the leaders also "touched base" about Ukraine and "all of them recommitted to Ukraine s territorial integrity and sovereignty"
About how allies now see the United States "I think our allies believe that we have to lock in progress as much as possible while there is a president who is a deeply committed transatlanticist in office."
More quotes will follow about climate and nuclear posture
