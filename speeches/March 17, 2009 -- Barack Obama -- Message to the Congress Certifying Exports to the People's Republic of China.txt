    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify to the Congress that the export of fine grain graphite to be used for solar cell applications and for the fabrication of components used in electronic and semiconductor fabrication, and two dual-motor, dual-shaft mixers to be used to produce carbon fiber and epoxy prepregs for the commercial airline industry is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be derived from these exports, will not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.
