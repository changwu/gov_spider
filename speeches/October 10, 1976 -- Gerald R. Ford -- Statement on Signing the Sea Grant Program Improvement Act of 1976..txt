    I AM signing H.R. 13035, the Sea Grant Program Improvement Act of 1976.
In its 10-year history, the National Sea Grant Program has played an appropriate role in developing and coordinating the resources of universities, laboratories, and other institutions in furthering the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of our Nation's ocean and coastal resources. H.R. 13035 would extend the National Sea Grant Program and ensure that this worthwhile work continues.
Some provisions in H.R. 13035 are unnecessary. The proposed national projects and international cooperation assistance programs are new categorical programs authorizing activities that could more appropriately be carried out by other agencies that have the responsibility to address national marine-related needs and problems.
Provisions in the bill which provide for the establishment of the position of Director of the Sea Grant Program and five other supergrade positions outside the Government-wide quota and without regard to the competitive appointment provisions of the civil service system are also unwise.
The Sea Grant Program provides a valuable means for bringing the resources of colleges and universities to bear on the Nation's efforts to make more productive use of our ocean resources. I believe that this bill will allow us to strengthen those efforts. I am, therefore, signing this bill into law.
