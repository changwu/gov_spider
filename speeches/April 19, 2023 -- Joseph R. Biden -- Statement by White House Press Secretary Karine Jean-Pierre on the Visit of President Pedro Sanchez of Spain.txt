    President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Pedro Sanchez of Spain to the White House on Friday, May 12 to further deepen the historic ties between the United States and Spain. The two leaders will review our efforts as NATO Allies and close partners to strengthen our bilateral defense relationship, transatlantic security, and economic prosperity. They will discuss our unwavering support for Ukraine and our efforts to impose costs on the Kremlin as Russia continues its brutal war of aggression. The leaders will coordinate on a range of issues as Spain prepares to assume the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in July, including climate change and expanded cooperation with Latin America and the Caribbean.
