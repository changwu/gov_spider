LAKE JACKSON, Texas - The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that it is officially launching operations in the candidate's home state of Texas. Efforts to date include the aligning of seasoned regional staff, the commencing of regular activity at the Clute headquarters, and the continued airing of the Texas-themed television and Web ad 'Vote Texas.'
The Ron Paul 2012 Texas headquarters is located at 845 West Plantation Drive, Clute, TX 77531. Initial office hours are from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 2:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Sundays. Those interested in volunteering for the campaign should contact the Clute office directly by calling 979-473-9995 or emailing texas@ronpaul2012.com.
Tomorrow, the 12-term Congressman from the 14th District begins a second three-day campaign swing in the Lone Star State, holding large town hall meetings at the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Houston. So far, Ron Paul has made major campaign appearances at Texas A&M University in College Station, the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, and the Main Plaza in San Antonio. His three-day campaign swing at these locations in mid-April attracted a remarkable 3,000-plus, 3,000-plus, and 3,600-plus supporters and undecided voters, respectively.
"Ron Paul is the only Texan, the only veteran, and the only real conservative competing in Texas. We expect Dr. Paul's fellow Texans to be receptive to his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the restoration of our economic and civil liberties, and a reversal of Washington spending and intrusion into the economy," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
