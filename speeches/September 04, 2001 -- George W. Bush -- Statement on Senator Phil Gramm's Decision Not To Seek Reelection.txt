    The Senate is losing a principled leader with the decision of Phil Gramm to retire after over two decades of distinguished service to the people of Texas and America. Senator Gramm is a man of common sense and uncommon courage who bases decisions on principle and always fights for what he believes is right.
Senator Gramm has been a consistent and committed advocate of tax relief for working Americans, beginning with his work on President Reagan's tax cut in 1981 as a Member of the House of Representatives and continuing with his tireless efforts to pass this year's monumental tax relief package.
As chairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Gramm has been responsible for major reforms, including the landmark Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act.
Senator Gramm is a close friend and valued adviser, and I look forward to working closely with him during the remainder of his term.
Laura and I extend our thanks to Phil, Wendy, and their children, Marshall and Jeff, for their family's commitment to public service and wish them all the best in the future.
