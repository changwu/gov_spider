    New Bern, NC â€” Newt Gingrich released the following statement reacting to Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum suspending his campaign:
"Rick has waged a remarkable campaign. His success is a testament to his tenacity and the power of conservative principles.
"I am committed to staying in this race all the way to Tampa so that the conservative movement has a real choice. I humbly ask Senator Santorum's supporters to visit Newt.org to review my conservative record and join us as we bring these values to Tampa. We know well that only a conservative can protect life, defend the Constitution, restore jobs and growth and return to a balanced budget."
