    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Pennsylvania Treasurer Robin L. Wiessmann, demonstrating Hillary's growing support in the Keystone State.
"Hillary has the strength and experience to deliver the change Pennsylvanians need," Wiessmann said. "She will restore badly needed fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency to our government and begin repairing America's image around the world."
Wiessmann took office in 2007, after establishing a long track record as a pioneer for women in her field. From 1990 through 1999, she was a founding principal and president of Artemis Capital Group, the leading women-owned investment banking firm in the United States. In 1999, the National Women Executives in State Government Association awarded her the "Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award." The Women's City Club of New York lauded Treasurer Wiessmann's efforts to advance the status of women in business by awarding her the Civic Spirit Award in 1996.
Previously, Treasurer Wiessmann served the City of Philadelphia as the Deputy Director of Finance from 1980 to 1984, before spending the next six years at Goldman Sachs as a Vice President. She has served as a financial advisor and investment banker for numerous state treasurers and governors as well as the comptrollers of New York State and New York City.
Treasurer Wiessmann, currently residing in Bucks County, joins a host of Pennsylvania leaders already endorsing Clinton, including Congressman Joe Sestak, Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz, Philadelphia Mayor John Street and dozens of state legislators and local officials.
