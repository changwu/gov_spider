    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, John Edwards for President communications director Chris Kofinis released the following statement regarding a new estimate for the cost of the Iraq war and Senator Clinton's continuing failure to offer straight answers on Iraq and Iran:
"The staggering estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that the war in Iraq will cost $1.9 trillion is a stark reminder of why it is so critical that every presidential candidate offer the American people a real plan for ending the war.
"For over a year, Senator Edwards has proposed a very specific plan for withdrawal, including the immediate withdrawal of 40-50,000 troops to jump-start the political solution needed to end the violence, a diplomatic offensive involving all local, national, and regional parties, and a complete withdrawal of all combat troops within 9 or 10 months. Unfortunately, other than political rhetoric and doubletalk, we've heard nothing from Senator Clinton about her specific plans to end this war.
"Even more disturbing, while Senator Clinton still refuses to lay out a detailed plan for ending the war in Iraq, she seems more than willing to help President Bush take America closer to war with Iran. After nearly seven years of George Bush, and a terrible and costly war, the American people deserve straight answers on Iraq and Iran from every presidential candidate -- the real question is when is Senator Clinton going to start providing them?"
