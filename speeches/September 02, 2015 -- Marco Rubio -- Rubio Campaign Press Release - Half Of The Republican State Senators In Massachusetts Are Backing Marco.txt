    
We're proud to announce the Massachusetts leadership team for Marco's campaign: State Senator Richard Ross, State Senator Vinny deMacedo, State Senator Ryan Fattman, State Representative Keiko Orrall, State Representative Shawn Dooley and former Massachusetts GOP Chairman Bob Maginn.
"As the Assistant Minority Leader of the State Senate, I am proud to endorse Marco Rubio for President," State Senator Richard Ross said. "Marco is a generational leader who has a bold vision for the 21st Century and I look forward to helping him in Massachusetts."
State Representative Orrall said she was won over in part by Marco's higher-ed reforms: "As a mother of two children, I am proud to support Marco Rubio because one of his priorities is to make higher education more affordable. Marco had over $100,000 in student loans a few years ago, so no one better understands the need to make higher education more affordable than Marco."
"As the former chairman of the Massachusetts Party, I believe Marco Rubio is the future of our party and I am excited to support him," Maginn said. "He has defined the right strategy to deal with China, and Marco's New American Century is exactly the vision our party and country needs for the 21st century."
The endorsements mean that fully half the GOP's representatives in the Massachusetts State Senate are backing Marco. We're very glad to have them on board!
