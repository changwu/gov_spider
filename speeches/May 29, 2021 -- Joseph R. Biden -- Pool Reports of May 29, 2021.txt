POTUS out of town pool report #2 - lunch lid called until 2 p.m. 
Pool call time here in Wilmington was noon.
And the WH has called a lunch lid until 2 p.m.
Weather here is cool and cloudy, but it's not currently raining. (So, not ideal golfing weather but perhaps better than it was this morning, if anyone is considering a round of golf in Wilmington, and I'm not saying anyone is.)
