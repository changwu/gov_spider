    Ladies and gentlemen:
Thank you all for this lovely present.
When I heard the list of dignitaries that your chairman just listed, it reminded me of the war--a great group of soldiers standing out here would have thought there was an awful lot of brass coming around the corner. This is sort of the political brass.
We are having a good time in New Hampshire for the past day and a half. We started way down south and have been all around--played golf--got rained out--doing all right up until this moment--everything has been lovely. Spent the night with Secretary Weeks and will be in New Hampshire up until noon today when we leave at Berlin.
As I was coming in, someone told me that there was only one speech you could make in this town, which was quite long ago, that the good Lord could have made a better place than Lancaster, but he didn't. Which does seem sort of a nice way of saying this place is beautiful.
I am grateful to the band for playing Hail to the Chief as I came up here. I am astonished at the crowd out here this morning, but I would be a liar if I didn't say I was highly pleased that you did turn out. It is good to see you all. Maybe I can come back again.
Thank you a lot.
NOTE.: The President spoke at 9:10 a.m. The chairman of the welcoming committee, Wilbur M. Schurman, presented a leather wallet to the President.
