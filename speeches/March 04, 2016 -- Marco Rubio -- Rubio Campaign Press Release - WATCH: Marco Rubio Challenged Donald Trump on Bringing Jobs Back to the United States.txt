Needless to say, the exchange didn't go unnoticed:
.@marcorubio baited @realDonaldTrump and Trump took the bait

So that's a "no" from Trump on whether he will bring his clothing companies back from Mexico and China. #cpacdebate

Trump still isn't actually answering the question about whether or not Trump collection clothes are made in Mexico

So Trump won't make clothes in U.S. B/c of devaluation — got it

Good answer here from Rubio. He's hitting Trump for saying that he, not the private sector, would create jobs. #GOPDebate

Rubio is clearly under Trump's skin. Two hours of this, he might crack. #GOPDebate
