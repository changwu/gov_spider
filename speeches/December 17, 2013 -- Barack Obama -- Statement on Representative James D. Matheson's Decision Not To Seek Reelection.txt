    Jim Matheson has proudly represented the people of Utah for more than 12 years in the United States Congress. He has been a forceful advocate of our Nation's veterans and worked to strengthen our economy through his support of key trade agreements. Michelle and I thank Congressman Matheson for his service and wish him, his wife Amy, and their two sons the very best in the future.
