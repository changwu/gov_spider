    To Sidney Harman
I accept your resignation as Under Secretary of Commerce with genuine regret.
You have made significant contributions during the early years of the Administration, especially in the areas of Quality of Working Life and Minority Economic Development.
Your design and execution of the program to revitalize the domestic shoe industry has been a significant achievement.
I wish you the best of times in your continuing life and work.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
Dear Mr. President:
Please accept my resignation as Under Secretary of Commerce effective December 1, 1978.
I have appreciated the opportunity to serve you and your Administration and I thank you for the confidence and responsibility you placed in me through this appointment.
I believe that the programs I initiated at your instruction are now in good order and that the time is appropriate for me to move to other activity in the private sector.
I shall, of course, be available at your call for any assignment you determine will be of service to you.
Faithfully yours,
SIDNEY HARMAN
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
