    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 proposals in my FY 2011 Budget for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice.
These amendments would support efforts to secure the Southwest border and enhance Federal border protection, law enforcement, and counternarcotics activities.
The amounts requested would be partially offset by cancelling $100 million from a lower priority program within the Department of Homeland Security. The proposed budget authority for FY 2010 would, therefore, increase by a net total of $500 million as a result of these amendments.
This request responds to urgent and essential needs. Therefore, I request these proposals be considered as emergency requirements. The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
