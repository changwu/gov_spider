    Today I am signing S. 2796, a bill which provides continuing authorization for the Consumer Product Safety Commission and makes certain amendments
in that Agency's authority.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has had a troubled 5-year history, but it has a crucial mission: to protect Americans' health and safety. In considering this legislation, the administration and Congress reviewed the problems faced by this Agency and decided to extend its life for 3 additional years. At the end of that period, there will be a "sunset" review. The CPSC has new, vigorous leadership, and this bill gives it more flexible procedures. It now has the opportunity to do an effective, responsible job.
This bill also requires the Commission to review all of its regulations within the next 18 months. This provision is an important contribution to our effort to update outmoded regulations throughout the Government and eliminate unnecessary ones.
This bill also addresses the difficult problem of exports of products which do not comply with U.S. safety standards. While the work that Congress has done in this area has been generally constructive, I am concerned that the shipment-by-shipment notification required by this bill will impose unnecessary burdens on American exporters, and my administration will work with Congress to attempt to reduce these burdens. United States policy governing the export of hazardous products has been proliferating on a piecemeal basis. A number of statutes applicable to differing types of products address the export issue in different ways. An interagency task force, chaired by Esther Peterson, my Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs, has been evaluating the laws in this area with the goal of developing a more uniform policy. We expect to announce recommendations in this area by the end of the year.
