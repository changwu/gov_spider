    BOTH SIDES of the negotiating parties have come here to the White House studio with me tonight to report that they have now reached agreement on the terms of a settlement of the airline strike.
The agreement that was reached just a few moments ago in the Executive Office Building between the five airlines and the International Association of Machinists is essentially within the general framework of the Presidential emergency board recommendations as submitted by Chairman Morse, Mr. Ginsburg, and Mr. Neustadt, who were members of that Board.
Obtaining a settlement within this framework has been the objective of this administration ever since the board made its report to me.
The fact that productivity has advanced so rapidly in the airline industry means, according to all the participants in this strike, that this settlement that has been reached will not be inflationary.
Unit labor costs in the air transportation industry will continue to decline, thus assuring that this settlement will not contribute to any increase in the prices the public pays.
The details of this arrangement, which has just been agreed upon a few moments ago, will now be prepared and presented to--and we expect thoroughly discussed by--the members of this union scattered throughout the United States in order that they might act upon the recommendations of their leaders this Sunday.
As soon as the membership votes upon the matter, the full details of their vote and the settlement will be announced.
We are very pleased that these gentlemen have produced an agreement. [At this point the President introduced William J. Curtin, chief negotiator for the airlines, and P. L. Siemiller, president of the International Association of Machinists. The President then concluded his remarks.]
Thank you, gentlemen.
Good evening, and God bless you all.
