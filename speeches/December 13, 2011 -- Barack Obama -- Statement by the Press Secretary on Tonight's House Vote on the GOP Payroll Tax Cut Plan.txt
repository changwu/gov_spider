    This Congress needs to do its job and stop the tax hike that's scheduled to affect 160 million Americans in 18 days. This is not a time for Washington Republicans to score political points against the President. It's not a time to refight old ideological battles. And it's not a time to break last summer's bipartisan agreement and hurt the middle class by cutting things like education, clean energy, and veterans' programs without asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.
This is a time to help the middle class and all those trying to reach it by extending a tax cut worth $1,000 for the average family. The President has been very clear: Congress should not finish their business before finishing the business of the American people. They cannot go on vacation before agreeing to prevent a tax hike on 160 million Americans and extending unemployment insurance. That is simply inexcusable in this economy. It is our expectation that in the eleventh hour Congressional Republicans and Democrats will come to an agreement to protect the middle class and finish their budget work for the year.
