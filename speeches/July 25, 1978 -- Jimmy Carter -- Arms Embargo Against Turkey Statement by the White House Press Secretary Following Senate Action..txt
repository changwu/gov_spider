    The President is gratified at the strong bipartisan support in the Senate of the administration's request for lifting the Turkish arms embargo. This is a constructive and statesmanlike action that will strengthen the security of the United States and the solidarity of the NATO Alliance. It is an action that we believe is in the best interest of the people of Greece, of Turkey, and of Cyprus. We value both allies and respect the contribution they make to the strength of the West. We wish to do everything possible to help them maintain strong democratic societies, strong economies, and their ability to make a significant contribution to the defense of a very important segment of the NATO area.
We look forward to accelerated progress toward settlement of problems that have persisted in the Eastern Mediterranean for far too long. We desire to see all peoples of the region work in harmony to settle issues that have drawn them apart.
The size of this vote indicates the growing realization that the embargo has outlived its usefulness. The Senate action today can only encourage and enhance the positive developments of the past few days. The President hopes that the House next week will act to further encourage this progress.
