    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act of l945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 of May 25, 1993 (UNSCR 827), and subsequent resolutions,
I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, found in Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998, that the actions and policies of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the "FRY (S&M)") and the Republic of Serbia with respect to Kosovo, by promoting ethnic conflict and human suffering, threatened to destabilize countries of the region and to disrupt progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing the Dayton peace agreement, and therefore constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I declared a national emergency to deal with that threat and ordered that economic sanctions be imposed with respect to those governments. I issued Executive Order 13121 of April 30, 1999, in response to the continuing human rights and humanitarian crises in Kosovo. That order revised and substantially expanded the sanctions imposed pursuant to Executive Order 13088.
In view of the peaceful democratic transition begun by President Vojislav Kostunica and other newly elected leaders in the FRY (S&M), the promulgation of UNSCR 827 and subsequent resolutions calling for all states to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the illegitimate control over FRY (S&M) political institutions and economic resources or enterprises exercised by former President Slobodan Milosevic, his close associates and other persons, and those individualsâ€™ capacity to repress democracy or perpetrate or promote further human rights abuses, and in order to take steps to counter the continuing threat to regional stability and implementation of the Dayton peace agreement and to address the national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 13088, I hereby order:
Section 1. Amendments to Executive Order 13088. (a) Section 1 of Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998, as revised by section 1(a) of Executive Order 13121 of April 30, l999, is revised to read as follows:
