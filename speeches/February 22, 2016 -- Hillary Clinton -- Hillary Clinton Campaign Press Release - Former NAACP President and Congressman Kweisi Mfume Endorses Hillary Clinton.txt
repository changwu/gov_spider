    Former NAACP President and CEO and five-term Maryland Congressman Kweisi Mfume announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president today. Mfume praised Clinton as a time tested leader with a track record of working for everyday people, especially on issues important to the African American and Latino communities.
"For decades, Hillary Clinton has demonstrated her commitment to fighting for Black and Latino communities in both deed and action. She is a proven leader with a long record of working for everyday people and getting the job done. She has been a remarkable colleague and friend who I know and trust. 
"From voting rights, to health care, to education, to reforming our criminal justice system and eradicating poverty the need for a proven and time tested leader is more clear today than ever before.
"The basic American principle of equal treatment under law is in many ways still under attack. We need a leader who has stood up and spent time working on our behalf when it wasn't popular. She has used her life to fight for others and not just to make promises. For working families, minority communities, millennials and our seniors there is too much at stake in this election to give it away.
"I served in Congress with Bernie Sanders and know him to be a likable guy, but I know that Hillary understands our struggles first hand. I believe she is the candidate best suited to carry on the work and progress made on health care and common sense gun reforms… and then actually get something done. As a former student organizer, city council member, congressman and national president of the NAACP, I am proud to enthusiastically endorse and work for Hillary Clinton to be our next President of the United States."
