    Governor O'Malley is a lifelong public servant who has spent his career making Government more accessible and transparent, while keeping the American people at the heart of his work.
As mayor of Baltimore and Governor of Maryland, he adopted data and performance-driven technologies to tackle complex challenges facing the communities he served, and I saw the results firsthand when we worked together during my time as Vice President. As Governor, he made Government work more effectively across his administration and enhanced the way millions of people accessed critical services.
Since day 1 I have fought to strengthen and defend Social Security, which tens of millions of Americans have paid into and depend on to support their livelihoods. I know that Governor O'Malley will continue to be a strong partner who works tirelessly to protect Social Security for generations to come.
