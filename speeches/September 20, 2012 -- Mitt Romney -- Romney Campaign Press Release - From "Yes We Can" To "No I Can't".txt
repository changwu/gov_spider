    "Now the country faces major challenges, you know that we face massive debt, trillion-dollar deficits. We face a Washington that's broken — that can't get the job done. The President today threw in the white flag of surrender again. He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance in November. He's going outside. I can change Washington. I will change Washington. We'll get the job done from the inside — Republicans and Democrats will come together. He can't do it. His slogan was 'Yes, we can.' His slogan now is 'No, I can't.' This is time for a new president." — Mitt Romney
