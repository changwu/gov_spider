In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85), I hereby notify you of my decision to establish a new level for the notification procedure for digital computers set forth in section 1211(a) of Public Law 105-85.

In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(e), I hereby notify you of my decision to remove Latvia from the list of countries covered under section 1211(b).
