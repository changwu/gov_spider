    Dole for President Campaign Manager Scott Reed released the following statement today:
"The Dole Campaign is pleased that the Clinton/Gore campaign is now prepared to discuss the Free TV for Straight Talk Coalition's proposal for daily, serial appearances on network television by the two candidates this fall. We share their desire that these nightly broadcasts not have a deleterious impact on the proposed candidate debates.
It is certainly consistent with Clinton/Gore campaign practice to try preserving use of the Oval Office for these broadcasts; after all, this White House runs more political activity from within its walls that any other in history. We have stated previously that use of the Oval Office for these broadcasts is not acceptable because that is the location where the Commander-in-Chief addresses the nation in times of crisis and should not be cheapened for campaign messages. Surely, within the White House there are other locations for broadcasting.
"For practical purposes, limiting these broadcasts to live appearances does not make sense.
"Nonetheless, Mr. Knight's statement is a positive development, and progress is being made. We look forward to discussing this with the Coalition to see how, now that the Clinton/Gore campaign is moving toward doing this, a serious commitment can be reached."
