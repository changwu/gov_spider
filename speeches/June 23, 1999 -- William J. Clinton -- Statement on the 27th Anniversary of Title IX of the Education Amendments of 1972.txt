    On this 27th anniversary of the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, we celebrate what can be accomplished when we allow all Americans—men and women—equal opportunity to be their best. By opening doors previously closed, Title IX provides women and girls with quality opportunities for achievement in education—in academics as well as athletics.
Today we reflect on the profound changes this legislation has helped bring about in American education, including changing expectations of women's achievements, lowering the dropout rate for women, and increasing opportunities in math and science. Since 1971, dramatically greater numbers of women have completed postsecondary, graduate, and professional degrees. Employment opportunities in many nontraditional professions for women have also opened up. The U.S. athletes in the Women's World Cup, currently being watched by millions of fans across the country, are shining examples of the value of increased participation in athletics by women.
While we have come a long way, there is still further progress to be made in undoing barriers to equal opportunity for women. We must continue to work to close the pay gap and ensure equal pay, enable men and women to meet their responsibilities at work and home, and end discrimination in the workplace. Too many women are paid less than men, and too many still experience discrimination in the workplace.
As we move forward towards the eradication of discrimination based on gender, we celebrate Title IX and our Nation's commitment to equality.
