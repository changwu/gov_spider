    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the death of Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., one of our most thoughtful and conscientious Justices. For over 15 years on the Supreme Court, he approached each case without an ideological agenda, carefully applying the Constitution, the law, and Supreme Court precedent regardless of his own personal views about the case. His opinions were a model of balance and judiciousness. As a result, he was the decisive voice on the Court in addressing some of the most important issues of our day.
Justice Powell was an admirable public servant. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones.
