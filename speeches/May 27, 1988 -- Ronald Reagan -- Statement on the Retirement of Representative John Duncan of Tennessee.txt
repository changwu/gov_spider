    Today I learned that my good friend John Duncan has announced that he will not run for reelection to the House of Representatives from the Second District of Tennessee. John was first elected to the House in 1964 to the seat held by Howard Baker's father and then his mother. John's service in the succeeding decades has demonstrated the highest dedication and commitment to the well-being of the Nation and his beloved State of Tennessee. In recent years, his leadership as ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee has proved critical to ensuring fiscal responsibility in the Federal Government.
Nancy and I wish John and Lois the very best of everything always.
