The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....Retweets: 26949Favorites: 109670

....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S. far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn't immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border I will be CLOSING.....Retweets: 28682Favorites: 126163

....the Border or large sections of the Border next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do but they just take our money and 'talk.' Besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.) that the Border closing would be a good thing!Retweets: 22750Favorites: 96039

Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3.0% GDP & Stock Market would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!Retweets: 20712Favorites: 90586

Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the 'insurance policy' statement was made by a dirty cop I got the answers I wanted the Truth.....Retweets: 27599Favorites: 119739
