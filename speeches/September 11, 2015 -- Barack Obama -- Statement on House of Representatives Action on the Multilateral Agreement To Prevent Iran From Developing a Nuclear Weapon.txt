    Today's vote in the House of Representatives is the latest indication that the more Members have studied the historic deal that will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the more they have come out in support of it. As we conclude the most consequential national security debate since the decision to invade Iraq, I am gratified that the lawmakers, led by Democratic Leader Pelosi, who have taken care to judge the deal on the merits are joining our allies and partners around the world in taking steps that will allow for the implementation of this long-term, comprehensive deal. Now, we must turn to the critical work of implementing and verifying this deal so that Iran cannot pursue a nuclear weapon. In doing so, we'll write the latest chapter of American leadership in the pursuit of a safer, more hopeful world.
