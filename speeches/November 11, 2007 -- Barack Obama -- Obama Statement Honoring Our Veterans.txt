    CHICAGO, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on Veterans Day.
"As we mark Veterans Day, all of America must speak with one voice to America's veterans: we honor your service, we are in awe of your sacrifice, and we will do everything that it takes to be there for you just as you have been there for us. Our veterans are a part of an unbroken line of Americans who have borne the greatest burden for our freedom -- from those who threw off the tyranny of a King to those who fight bravely and brilliantly under our flag today. Keeping faith with those who serve is a cornerstone of American patriotism. Let us rededicate ourselves to honoring those who have served by providing them with the services, support, and respect that they have earned."
