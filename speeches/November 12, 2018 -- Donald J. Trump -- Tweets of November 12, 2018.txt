Exactly 100 years ago today on November 11th 1918 World War I came to an end. We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle.... https://t.co/JPUkOr4rW1Retweets: 20988Favorites: 93273

Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders. Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly which it hasn't on both Military and Trade. We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection........Retweets: 24416Favorites: 107533

.....hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. I told them that this situation cannot continue - It is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the United States. Massive amounts.....Retweets: 18266Favorites: 79950

.....of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses. It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection or protect themselves...and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR!Retweets: 22058Favorites: 94338

The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!Retweets: 34108Favorites: 120216

American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws. 'These guys are acting much worse and have much more potential for damage to consumers than anything AT&T-Time Warner would do.' Charlie GasparinoRetweets: 17735Favorites: 68240
