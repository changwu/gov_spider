    After Donald Trump's comments at his press conference today Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jake Sullivan released the following statement:
"This has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent. That's not hyperbole, those are just the facts. This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue."
