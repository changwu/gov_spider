    The President announced today his intention to nominate Thomas Glynn of Belmont, Massachusetts for the post of Deputy Secretary of Labor. Glynn is currently Brown University's senior vice president for finance and administration.
"One of the most important things we need to do in this administration is learn how to manage the Government better," said President Clinton. "I've pledged to save $9 billion by controlling administrative costs. Thomas Glynn has the kind of experience managing large institutions, both public and private, that is needed to make that happen."
