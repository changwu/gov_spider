Pursuant to the authority contained in title II of the Kenneth M.

• is necessary to support United States efforts to counter international terrorism; • is necessary to support the operational readiness of United States Armed Forces or coalition partners to counter international terrorism; • is important to Azerbaijan's border security; and • will not undermine or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan or be used for offensive purposes against Armenia.
Accordingly, I hereby extend the waiver of section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.
You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this determination and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
