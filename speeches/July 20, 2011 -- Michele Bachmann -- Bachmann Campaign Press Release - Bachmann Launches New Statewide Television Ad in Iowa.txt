    Des Moines, Iowa â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann announced today the launch of a new ad entitled "Courage" to run statewide in Iowa beginning today, July 20, 2011. The ad highlights Bachmann's commitment to voting 'no' on increasing the debt ceiling and her courage to deal with the economic realities facing the federal government.

  
  
  
  

The following is text of the ad:
"I will not vote to increase the debt ceiling. It goes completely contrary to commonsense and how I grew up in Iowa. So here I am in Congress watching these people borrow more money that we don't have so that my children can be further indebted. We have to deal with the economic reality and I have the will and I have the courage to see this through I'm Michele Bachmann and I approve this message."
