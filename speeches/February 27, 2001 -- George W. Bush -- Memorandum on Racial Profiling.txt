    Memorandum for the Attorney General 
Subject: Racial Profiling
I hereby direct you to review the use by Federal law enforcement authorities of race as a factor in conducting stops, searches, and other investigative procedures. In particular, I ask that you work with the Congress to develop methods or mechanisms to collect any relevant data from Federal law enforcement agencies and work in cooperation with State and local law enforcement in order to assess the extent and nature of any such practices.
I further direct that you report back to me with your findings and recommendations for the improvement of the just and equal administration of our Nation's laws.
GEORGE W. BUSH
