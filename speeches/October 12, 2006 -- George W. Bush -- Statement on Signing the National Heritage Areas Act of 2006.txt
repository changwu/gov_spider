    Today, I have signed into law S. 203, the "National Heritage Areas Act of 2006." The Act establishes national heritage areas and reduces the royalty rate on certain minerals.
A number of provisions of the Act purport to give to management entities or local coordinating entities, composed of individuals who are not officers of the United States appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, significant governmental authority, such as authority to make grants from Federal appropriated funds to implement management plans for heritage areas. As is consistent with the Appointments Clause and with requirements in the Act concerning approval by the Secretary of the Interior of the management plans, the executive branch shall construe the provisions to require exercise by the Secretary of the Interior of the significant governmental authority given by the provisions, specifically including the exercise by the Secretary of final authority over any disbursement of Federal appropriated funds by a management entity or local coordinating entity.
