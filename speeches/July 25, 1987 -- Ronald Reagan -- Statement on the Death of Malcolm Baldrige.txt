    The Nation has suffered a great loss with the tragic and untimely death of Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. An experienced businessman and respected community leader, he was a talented and dedicated public servant who sought nothing more than to make a contribution to America. And indeed he did. Under his stewardship, the Department of Commerce played a key role in the rebirth of our country's prosperity, and all of us owe a great debt to Mac Baldrige.
He was a loyal member of the Cabinet, whose common sense, wisdom, and counsel I relied on often and deeply valued. Mac and I shared a special affinity for the West, and I will greatly miss his friendship.
Nancy and I are truly saddened and extend our deepest sympathy to Midge and the Baldrige family. They will be in our thoughts and prayers in the time ahead.
