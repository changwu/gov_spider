Our campaign continues to grind away at ballot access. Every state has a different set of rules, many have fees (some exorbitant!) and others require a dedicated team of volunteers and staff to help collect signatures.
To date, we are on the ballot in the following states:
Arizona, Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.
We are also on the ballot in Guam and American Samoa.
Please keep this effort going strong, chip in $1 today to make certain you have the opportunity to cast your vote for Mike Huckabee.

So please chip in today, to help support our hundreds of volunteers working hard on ballot access.
Sincerely,
Chip Saltsman
Senior Advisor
P.S. Expect another ballot update from Sarah. We have more news to make soon.
