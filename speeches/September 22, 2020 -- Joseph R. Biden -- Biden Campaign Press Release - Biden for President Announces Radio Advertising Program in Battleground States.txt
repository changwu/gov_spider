    New Radio Ads Highlight Joe Biden's Pittsburgh Speech, Plans for Rural America
Today, Biden for President is announcing its radio advertising program across nine battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with two new spots.
"Above All Else" is a 0:60 radio spot airing in all nine states, highlighting the dangers of Donald Trump's America with 200,000 dead from a virus he lied about. The ad features excerpts of Joe Biden's August speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that criticizes Trump for fanning the flames of violence and instilling fear among the American people. The ad also reiterates Biden's commitment to protecting the American people from COVID-19, racial violence, and crime and looting.
Building on the campaign's digital ads that target rural voters, it is also releasing "Our Kids," a 0:60 radio ad geared towards areas outside of metropolitan areas in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The spot features a narrator underscoring how Joe Biden understands opportunity is key to retaining rural jobs for future generations, and it outlines key parts of Biden's plans for rural America: better hospital and health care, reliable broadband internet, clean energy, and access to federal resources.
Radio is a significant investment of the campaign's paid media program and will remain active from now until Election Day. The campaign remains on television airwaves and digital platforms in a total of 13 states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
