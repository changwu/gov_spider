    I am pleased that the Senate unanimously confirmed Steve Preston to serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Steve is a strong leader whose understanding of our financial markets and strong management skills make him highly qualified to serve in this important position. He will aggressively work to ensure that the Department remains focused on its mission of making housing more affordable and helping Americans keep their homes. Steve is also a consensus builder who will build on our efforts to work with Congress on responsible legislation addressing our Nation's housing policies.
