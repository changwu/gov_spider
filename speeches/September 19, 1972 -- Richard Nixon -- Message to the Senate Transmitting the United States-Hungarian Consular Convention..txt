    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Hungarian People's Republic, signed at Budapest on July 7, 1972.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers signed the Convention for the United States during his official visit to Hungary. It is the first bilateral treaty concluded between the Governments of the United States and Hungary since World War II and reflects the increasingly warm contacts developing between Americans and Hungarians as well as between their Governments.
The Consular Convention, like others recently negotiated with Poland and Romania, will make possible improved consular services, including guaranteed communication between a citizen and his consul and prompt notification in case of detention.
I believe that this Convention will provide a cornerstone for the development and maintenance of friendly relations with Hungary, and I recommend that the Senate advise and consent to its ratification.
