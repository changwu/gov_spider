    Today, Biden for President is announcing the endorsement of 16 current and former elected officials and community leaders from Washington, an influential state on the March 10 primaries.
"Today's endorsements add to the groundswell of momentum we're seeing across the country for Joe Biden, including right here in Washington," said Washington State Senator Marko Liias. "These Washington leaders know that Joe Biden will fight tooth and nail for working families and turn the tide against Donald Trump's deeply personal attacks on immigrants, healthcare and the environment. Joe Biden is the only candidate who can build the most broad based coalition necessary to be successful on Super Tuesday, March 10, and beyond."
Today's endorsements build on the endorsement of former Washington Governor, Secretary of Commerce, and U.S. Ambassador to China, Gary Locke who announced his support of Vice President Joe Biden last month.
Today's endorsements include:

Wes Uhlman, Former Mayor of Seattle
Charlie Royer, Former Mayor of Seattle
