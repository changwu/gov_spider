    Urbandale, Iowa - Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann said today that another 22 Iowa pastors, church leaders and grassroots activists have announced their support since Wednesday, adding to the growing list of Iowa evangelical leaders who have endorsed her.
Bachmann's total is now more than 200 men and women of God who publicly support her candidacy. All 99 counties are represented and are committed to working hard for Michele in their local Jan. 3 caucuses.
Drew Klein, the campaign's faith outreach director, attributed the sharp increase to Bachmann's appeal to evangelicals to her record as a consistent conservative in word and deed.
"Michele Bachmann is the most principled Christian candidate in the race. Her core convictions are based on biblical truths and she has a no-compromise record when it comes to public policy," Klein said. "She is the one candidate that one does not need to explain, apologize for, or be embarrassed, ever. Her uncompromised record, paired with her faith, make her a clear choice for faith and family leaders, and more and more continue to join us every day."
The Iowa pastors and faith leaders are:

Rev. Colleen Benway, Chariton
Rev. Cecil Ballard and Susan Ballard, Marion
