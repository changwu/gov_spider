    Q. Mr. President, have you reached any agreements?
President Clinton. We're not finished with our conversations, and we'll have a statement later. We're having a good meeting, and I would just say again what I have said repeatedly—President Yeltsin and I have worked hard for more than 2 years to improve the safety and security of the people of Russia and the people of the United States. We are dismantling nuclear weapons at a more rapid rate than our treaties require. And we are working hard to improve the securities of our people. And that's what we've been doing here this morning. We've had a very good meeting, and we'll have more to say about the conversations we've had and will continue to have when we do our press statement.

The President. No one will ever solve all the problems, but—[inaudible].
