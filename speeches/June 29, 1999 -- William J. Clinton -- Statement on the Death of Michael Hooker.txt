    I was saddened to learn of the death of University of North Carolina Chancellor Michael Hooker. Michael Hooker devoted his life to improving higher education, not only in North Carolina but all over America. As chancellor of UNC, he was committed to building the best educational and cultural climate for students, while deepening the university's commitment to North Carolina and its economic future. His devotion led him to visit every county in North Carolina to discuss new ways of developing educational opportunity, and to encourage more people to participate in the educational system. I am especially grateful for his role in helping Education Secretary Riley implement our America Reads challenge, which enlists college students as tutors to help elementary students learn to read.
Michael Hooker represented the very best in our education system, and the very best in public service. He will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Carmen, and his daughter and grandchildren.
