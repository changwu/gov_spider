    Last month I unveiled my child care initiative to make child care better, safer, and more affordable. Today I am pleased that Congresswoman Kennelly has introduced comprehensive child care legislation that is also designed to meet the needs of America's children and families. Congresswoman Kennelly's bill is a strong package that, like mine, significantly increases child care subsidies for poor children, provides greater tax relief to help low- and middle-income families pay for child care, creates a tax credit for businesses that provide child care for their employees, increases after-school opportunities for children, promotes early learning, and improves child care quality.
This proposal is a testament to Congresswoman Kennelly's leadership on this issue and her commitment to the future of our Nation's children. I look forward to working with her and other Members of Congress to enact bipartisan child care legislation that helps Americans fulfill their responsibilities as workers and, even more important, as parents.
