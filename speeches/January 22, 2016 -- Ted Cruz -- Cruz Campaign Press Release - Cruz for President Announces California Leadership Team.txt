HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today named 118 members of his California Leadership Team.
"We have assembled a powerful team in California from the Oregon border to San Diego, and from the Pacific to the Sierra Nevada and I'm thankful for Ron Nehring's leadership of these courageous conservatives," said Cruz. "They have the commitment, experience, and insight to win and I look forward to working with them towards victory."
Former California Republican Party Chairman Michael Schroeder and former California legislator Ray Haynes will serve as California Co-Chairs of the Ted Cruz for President campaign. The campaign additionally announced the endorsements of Assemblymembers Shannon Grove of Bakersfield and Matthew Harper of Orange County together with former Chapman University Law School Dean John C. Eastman. Los Angeles investor Dan Palmer will serve as California state co-chair.
The endorsements of Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Tom McClintock were recently announced.
What they're saying:
"Conservative leaders trusted by the grassroots of our party are uniting behind Ted Cruz for President as we build the campaign organization to win the June 7th primary here in California. Our state will send the largest delegation to the Republican National Convention and our mission is for that delegation to be a Cruz delegation," said California campaign chairman Ron Nehring, who served as Chairman of the California Republican Party from 2007 to 2011 and as the party's 2014 nominee for Lt. Governor.
"Ted Cruz is the generational principled conservative we have been waiting for since Ronald Reagan. A Republican will win the presidency in this election. As conservatives this is our opportunity to make a difference and make sure that president does the right thing because he is grounded in our values," said campaign co-chair Michael Schroeder, who served as Chairman of the California Republican Party from 1997 to 1999.
"I support Senator Cruz because he proves his conservative bona fides every day he serves the people of this country. We don't have to wonder if we will get the real thing with Senator Cruz, he shows all of us he is the real thing with every word he says and every action he takes," said former legislator Ray Haynes, who served in the California legislature from 1993 to 2007.
"I have listened to each of the candidates and reviewed their records and Senator Cruz is the clear choice for President. He is qualified, conservative, articulate, and has a Reagan-like ability to lead. I look forward to being a part of the grassroots movement for Senator Cruz here in California," said Assemblyman Matthew Harper.
"To me, the most important job the President of the United States has is to protect our God-given rights, hallowed in the Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Ted Cruz understands this. Our founders pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to those ideals. Most Americans, and all who wear the uniform, make that same pledge – to safeguard and keep those sacred rights unsullied by human hands. We expect the same from our president. I trust Ted Cruz to protect and defend America's freedom, borders, and way of life from all who wish us harm, foreign, or domestic. That is why I support Ted Cruz for President without hesitation or reservation," said Assemblymember Shannon Grove.
"I wholeheartedly endorse Ted Cruz for President. I've known Ted for 20 years, dating to our time as co-clerks for Judge Michael Luttig on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia, and then at the Supreme Court of the United States, where he clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist while I was clerking for Justice Clarence Thomas. He was then, and is still, a strong, principled, constitutional conservative. This man has the ability to win both the nomination and against whomever the Democrats put up in November, and by so doing pick up where Ronald Reagan left off in restoring limited, constitutional government to our land," said John former Chapman University School of Law Dean John Eastman.
