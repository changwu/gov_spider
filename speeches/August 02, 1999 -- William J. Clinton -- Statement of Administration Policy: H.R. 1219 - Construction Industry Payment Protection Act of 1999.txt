    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Maloney (D) New York and 23 co-sponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 1219, which would statutorily increase the payment protection afforded subcontractors and suppliers on Federal construction contracts. The Administration recognizes the need to provide additional payment protection, and has worked administratively to do so. This legislation provides a strong statutory base for increased payment protection. Reducing the risk of non-payment helps to improve the likelihood of successful and timely completion of our construction projects and the effective use of taxpayer dollars.
