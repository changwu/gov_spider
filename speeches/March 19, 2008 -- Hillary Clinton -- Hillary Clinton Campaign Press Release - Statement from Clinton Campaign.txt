    In response to the proposal being floated today in Florida to address the primary situation, Clinton campaign Deputy Communications Director Phil Singer issued the following statement:
"Considering that the Obama campaign is essentially disenfranchising 1.7 million Floridians who are now signaling that they will vote for the Republican if their votes aren't counted, there is a very simple solution: Honor the vote that took place in January.
"Everyone was on the ballot, no candidate had an unfair advantage (even if Senator Obama was the only candidate to advertise) and it won't cost an extra penny.
"At this point, that seems to be the best option. Senator Obama should embrace it and abandon his current position which disenfranchises approximately 1.7 million people."
