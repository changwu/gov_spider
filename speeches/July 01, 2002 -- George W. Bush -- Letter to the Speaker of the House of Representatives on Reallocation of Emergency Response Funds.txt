    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In order to fulfill urgent requirements for civil aviation security, I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from the Emergency Response Fund. These funds will now be allocated to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001.
In addition, I am further revising my request for supplemental funding originally transmitted on March 21st to account for this transfer by adjusting my Administration's request for supplemental funding for FEMA and for TSA. This will ensure that FEMA has the full resources necessary to meet my commitment to the recovery of New York.
As provided in Public Law 107-38, the $270 million to be transferred will be made available immediately to TSA to continue its civil aviation security responsibilities.
This is the second time I have arranged a "bridge loan" from FEMA to TSA to allow the Congress to complete action on my March 21st emergency supplemental request. This option will not be available a third time, since FEMA has no additional remaining unobligated funds from Public Law 107-38. It is imperative that the Congress quickly pass an acceptable emergency supplemental bill to prevent a disruption of commercial air travel.
I hereby designate the revised requests contained in the accompanying material as emergency requirements pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
The details of these actions are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and recommendations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
