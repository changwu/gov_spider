    Today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement on Vice President Mike Pence's visit to New Hampshire:
"For four years, the Trump-Pence administration has failed Granite State workers and families. They failed to protect Americans from the COVID-19 crisis, and as a result, 438 Granite Staters have lost their lives and more than 65,000 are out of work. To make matters worse, the Trump Administration is trying to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, which would rip away critical protections from as many as 572,000 Granite Staters living with preexisting conditions. A campaign rally isn't going to reverse the damage wrought by this administration or make New Hampshire voters forget that for nearly four years, President Trump and Vice President Pence's failed leadership has left Granite State workers and families behind.
"New Hampshire needs a leader with a plan to end the pandemic and build the economy back better than before. Joe Biden will be a president who Granite Staters can trust to unite our nation, protect and expand access to quality, affordable health care, and build an economy that deals in everyone."
