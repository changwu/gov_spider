    Chicago, IL - "I deplore and condemn the vicious attacks perpetrated in New Delhi this weekend, which left 21 innocent people dead and nearly 100 wounded. These cowardly acts of mass murder are a stark reminder that India continues to suffer from the scourge of terrorism on a scale few other nations can imagine. I urge all countries to cooperate with Indian authorities in tracking down the perpetrators of this outrage. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families."
