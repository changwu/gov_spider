Boston, MA – Governor Mitt Romney today announced the endorsement of former New Hampshire State Senator Chuck Morse. Morse will assist Governor Romney in spreading his message for a stronger America throughout the Granite State.
"As a businessman and former elected representative, Chuck Morse has been an important leader in New Hampshire. Throughout his service in the State Legislature, Morse demonstrated strong conservative leadership and stood firm for fiscal responsibility. He will be a vital part of my campaign to bring conservative change to Washington," said Governor Romney.
With today's announcement, Chuck Morse said, "We need to stop the out of control pork barrel spending in Washington. Our leaders need to exercise fiscal responsibility. Our next president must be a person who has executive experience in reducing waste, who can make tough decisions, who can balance the books, and who doesn't mind using his veto pen. As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney eliminated a nearly $3 billion deficit– without raising taxes. Mitt Romney is the right candidate to lead this nation, because he has the experience, the character, and the commitment to change Washington and make it work for the American people."
