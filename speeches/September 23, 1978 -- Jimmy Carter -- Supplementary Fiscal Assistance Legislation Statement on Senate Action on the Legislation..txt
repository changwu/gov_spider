    I am pleased that the Senate has acted favorably on the Supplementary Fiscal Assistance program. The assistance provided by this bill will help our economically troubled States and localities to maintain basic services and to hold the line on tax increases. This program is an integral component of the urban policy that I proposed earlier this year. I am hopeful that the House will act quickly on supplementary fiscal assistance legislation.
