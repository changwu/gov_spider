8/14 POTUS Pool report No. 1. Checking in and schedule change.
Good morning all.
I'm your pooler for the day. Pool has been advised of an earlier call time (8:15 a.m. instead of 11 a.m.) The White House has not advised pool of what precipitated the early call time or any scheduling updates. POTUS schedule shows no public events. -Cleve

POTUS pool report No. 2. Bike ride.
POTUS and the first lady went for a mid-morning bike ride on the beach.
After a madcap dash through the islands abutting Charleston and a brief run on the beach, pool was stationed on a beach on Kiawah Island.
POTUS is wearing a blue shirt and khaki shorts and a Beau Biden foundation hat. His bike does not have toe clips.
There are a smattering of people walking on the beach or playing in the gentle surf. Some sat under blue umbrellas or in beach clothes and eyed the assembled reporters, figuring something's going on.
