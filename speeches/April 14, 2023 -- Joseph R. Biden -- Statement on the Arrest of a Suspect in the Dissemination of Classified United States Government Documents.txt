    I commend the rapid action taken by law enforcement to investigate and respond to the recent dissemination of classified U.S. Government documents. While we are still determining the validity of those documents, I have directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information, and our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies.
