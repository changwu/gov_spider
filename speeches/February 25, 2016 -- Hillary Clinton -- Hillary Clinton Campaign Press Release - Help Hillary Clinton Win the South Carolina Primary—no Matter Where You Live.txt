Can you feel the momentum? Saturday is the South Carolina primary—and we're working hard to earn a big win that will put Hillary Clinton one step closer to the nomination.
That means doing everything we can between now and then to get supporters to the polls.
That's where YOU come in. Here's how you can help right now—no matter where you live.
Step one: Find your friends in South Carolina on Facebook. Click this link and they'll pop up.
Step two: Send a message to each of your South Carolina friends. Ask them to text COMMIT2SC to 47246 to get important election updates, breaking news, and all the information they need to make it easy to vote.
This campaign is all about making a real difference in people's lives—that's why we're out there fighting alongside Hillary every single day. But first things first: we've got to lock down this nomination. And every voter we contact between now and Saturday will make a big difference.
So what are you waiting for? Let's get out there and win this thing!
