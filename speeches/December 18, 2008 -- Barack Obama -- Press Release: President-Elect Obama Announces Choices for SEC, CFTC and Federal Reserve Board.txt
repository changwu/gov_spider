    CHICAGOâ€”Today, President-elect Barack Obama announced that he intends to nominate Mary Schapiro as Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; Gary Gensler as Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and Daniel Tarullo to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
President-elect Obama said, "If the financial crisis has taught us anything, it's that failure of oversight and accountability doesn't just harm the individuals involved, it has the potential to devastate our entire economy. That's a failure we cannot afford. Financial regulatory reform will be one of the top legislative priorities of my Administration, and these individuals will help put in place new, common-sense rules of the road that will protect investors, consumers, and our entire economy. I have great faith and confidence in the ability of these outstanding public servants to make this possible."
