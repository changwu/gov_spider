    In light of Governor Reagan's statement yesterday that he would like to see our civil rights laws strengthened, and in light of the fact that he has announced a press conference for this afternoon, we again call upon him to state his position on and to support the fair housing bill which is now in the Senate. The legislation, the most significant piece of civil rights legislation in perhaps a decade, has already passed the House. The Governor's position is also relevant in light of his record as Governor of California, which shows that he advocated repeal of the California fair housing law known as the Rumford Act.
