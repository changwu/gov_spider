    The Clinton Campaign today named State Representative Rachel Storch its Missouri State Director.
"Rachel is a highly respected legislator who brings a deep knowledge of Missouri and its people to this campaign," said Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II. "With Rachel's hire, Hillary is making good on a promise she made to the people of Missouri: the Senator will make the investments needed to compete and win here. Hillary wisely recognizes the importance of Missouri as a bellwether state and is putting down roots here that will bear fruit."
"I'm delighted that Rachel will lead our efforts in Missouri," Clinton said. "With her help, we'll take our message of change across the Show Me State."
Elected to the House in 2004, Storch has risen to the rank of Deputy Whip of the Democratic Caucus, and serves on the Budget, Ways and Means, and Appropriations for Transportation and Economic Development Committees. After her first year in office, Storch was named "Best Local Politician" by the Riverfront Times and an "Up-and-Coming Politician" in St. Louis Magazine.
Prior to serving in the Missouri House, Storch was Deputy Chief of Staff for Senator Jean Carnahan and Legal Counsel and Director of Policy for Missouri Democratic Senate Leader Ken Jacob.
"I am proud to join this campaign, because America needs change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Storch said. "We're going to run an aggressive campaign throughout Missouri and I'm eager to get to work."
