    The President is deeply concerned about the recent acts of violence in Bolivia. The United States condemns needless violence, which undermines the rule of law. We reaffirm our strong support for President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and his democratically-elected government, and urge a peaceful resolution to Bolivia's economic and other challenges. The United States will continue to provide economic and financial assistance and support to the Bolivian government and people through this difficult time.
