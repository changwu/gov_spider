    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Obey (D) and Moody (D) Wisconsin)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2182, which would expand the boundaries of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin to include Long Island, because:
— existing Federal management of Long Island is adequate;
— the location of Long Island, some distance from the other management units of the Lakeshore and much closer to a State park, would complicate management of the existing Lakeshore; and
— the cost for land acquisition, development and operation of Long Island, given the strong action necessary to reduce the budget deficit, is unwarranted.
