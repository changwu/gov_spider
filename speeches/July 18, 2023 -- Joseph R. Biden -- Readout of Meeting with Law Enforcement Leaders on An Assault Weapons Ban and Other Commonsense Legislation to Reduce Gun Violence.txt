    Today, senior White House officials met with more than 20 law enforcement leaders from across the country to discuss how to build additional law enforcement support for an assault weapons and high-capacity magazine ban and other commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence. This meeting is the result of President Biden's May 2023 USA Today op-ed, in which he outlined a roadmap for building on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to enact additional gun safety legislation. One part of that roadmap, President Biden explained, is "build[ing] an even bigger, unrelenting coalition demanding that Congress pass additional gun safety legislation."
Law enforcement leaders discussed how officers all across the country are being outgunned by criminals armed with assault weapons and how those weapons of war grievously injure our children, neighbors, and community members. They provided substantive input on urgently needed actions to reduce gun violence in their communities. White House officials discussed the importance of mobilizing additional law enforcement voices – both leadership and rank and file officers – to make clear to members of Congress that supporting our police and improving the safety of American communities means banning assault weapons and taking other practical steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. Participants agreed on the urgency of building a broad coalition and an agenda for action informed by input from law enforcement. Participants also agreed on the need to work together to support passage of additional gun safety legislation.
