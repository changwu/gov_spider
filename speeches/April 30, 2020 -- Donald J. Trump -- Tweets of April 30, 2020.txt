.@CNN doesn't want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn & why they got the story so wrong. They, along with others, should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man & his family. They won't even cover the big breaking news about this scam!Retweets: 43003Favorites: 147321

Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually, he is doing a great job, I never shouted at him (been with me for years, including the 2016 win), & have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!Retweets: 26988Favorites: 119131

Lyin' Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn't know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He's a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!Retweets: 24941Favorites: 110274

I must admit that Lyin' Brian Williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN "anchorman" Don Lemon, the "dumbest man on television". Then you have Psycho Joe "What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?" Scarborough, another of the low I.Q. individuals!Retweets: 35790Favorites: 148961

Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!Retweets: 17666Favorites: 85266

Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone, a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe), was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred & bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!Retweets: 29082Favorites: 100864

We can't let the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, get away with stealing the Election. They tried that in 2016. How did that work out?Retweets: 44995Favorites: 204436
