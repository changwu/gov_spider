    With just two days until Mississippi's March 10 Primary, former Obama-Biden Administration Secretary of the Navy, Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and Governor of Mississippi Ray Mabus released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I have known and worked with Joe Biden for more than 30 years. As Secretary of the Navy in the Obama-Biden Administration, I worked closely with Vice President Biden and I can tell you from firsthand experience: Joe Biden is ready to take over as Commander-in-Chief on day one of his presidency. I hope Mississippians join me on Tuesday and vote for Joe Biden — a man who stands with Mississippians, understands our issues and needs, and who has the empathy and humanity our country desperately needs right now. In this election, the most important of our lifetimes, we need to nominate the right candidate for the job — and that candidate is Joe Biden."
Mabus served as the Obama-Biden Administration's Secretary of the Navy, the Clinton Administration's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and previously as the Governor of Mississippi.
Mabus joins a strong list of Mississippi leaders backing Biden, including Congressman Bennie Thompson, Secretary of Agriculture and Congressman Mike Espy, and more than 25 state legislators including all 16 members of the Mississippi Senate Democratic Caucus. Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
