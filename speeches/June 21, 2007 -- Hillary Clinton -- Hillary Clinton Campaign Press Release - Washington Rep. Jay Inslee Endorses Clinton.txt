    Inslee will serve as a Co-Chair of Energy and Environmental Task Force
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Washington Congressman Jay Inslee and named him a Co-Chair of Clinton's Energy and Environmental Task Force.
"The people of Washington are ready for change. There is too much at stake to take chances after the last seven years. We need a candidate who has been through the fire and knows how to lead," Inslee said. "Hillary Clinton has the vision to lead this country in a clean-energy revolution. She has the toughness, experience, and resolve needed to end the Iraq war and begin rebuilding America's image around the world."
Inslee first served in Congress from 1992-1994, and was elected again to the House of Representatives in 1998. From his post on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Inslee has pushed for passage of the New Apollo Energy Act to promote clean and renewable energy and legislation to protect our public lands. Inslee has also fought to preserve and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.
Inslee previously served as a Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and was a member of the State House of Representatives and a local prosecutor.
"I deeply admire Jay's tireless efforts to preserve our environment and promote clean energy for America," Clinton said. "I'm delighted that he will advise our campaign and help lead our effort in Washington."
