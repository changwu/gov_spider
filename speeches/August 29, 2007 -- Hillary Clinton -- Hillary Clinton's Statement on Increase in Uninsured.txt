    Nearly 500,000 Nevadans Now Lack Health Insurance; Up 2.5% Since 2005
"Today's new Census Bureau data reporting that now 47 million Americans have no health insurance, an increase of over 2 million people, demonstrates the urgent need to cover every American. When I began the fight for universal coverage almost fifteen years ago, there were 37 million people uninsured. It was an outrage then and with ten million more people uninsured today, it is an even deeper outrage today. Yet, the uninsured have been invisible to this President, but if I'm President, they will not be invisible to me. From day one of my campaign, I have committed to ensuring that every American has quality, affordable health insurance coverage. I look forward to announcing my plan to achieve this long overdue goal next month."
According to the Census Bureau's report, 496,000 Nevadans â€“ nearly 20% of the state's population - are currently without insurance. The number of uninsured Nevadans has increased by 2.5 percent since 2005.
