...The consent decree signed by the Secretary, with the consent of Kemp, is perhaps even more poorly negotiated than the deal that John Kerry made with Iran. Now it turns out that Brad R's brother works for China, and they definitely don't want Trump. So disgusting! #MAGARetweets: 30219Favorites: 127151

I love the Great State of Georgia, but the people who run it, from the Governor, @BrianKempGA, to the Secretary of State, are a complete disaster and don't have a clue, or worse. Nobody can be this stupid. Just allow us to find the crime, and turn the state Republican....Retweets: 41082Favorites: 179051

....that, quite frankly, didn't have much of a chance, like 7, 8 or 9. The Presidential Election was Rigged with hundreds of thousands of ballots mysteriously flowing into Swing States very late at night as everyone thought the election was easily won by me. There were many....Retweets: 25801Favorites: 128681

The Wall Street Journal's very boring & incoherent Editorial fails to mention my big & easy wins in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa & many other states that the @WSJ & other joke polls said I would lose. Also, they fail to mention the fact that I got many Republican Senators elected..Retweets: 34953Favorites: 161868

Barack Obama was toppled from the top spot and President Trump claimed the title of the year's Most Admired Man. Trump number one, Obama number two, and Joe Biden a very distant number three. That's also rather odd given the fact that on November 3rd, Biden allegedly racked upRetweets: 42753Favorites: 189893

...millions more votes than Trump, but can't get anywhere close to him in this poll. No incoming president has ever done as badly in this annual survey. @MarkSteynOnline @TuckerCarlson That's because he got millions of Fake Votes in the 2020 Election, which was RIGGED!Retweets: 31196Favorites: 142278
