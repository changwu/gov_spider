    Today, with Governor Tim Walz's signature, Minnesota has become the twelfth state, along with the District of Columbia, to pass paid family and medical leave legislation, and the first state to do so in 2023. President Biden commends the leadership of Governor Tim Walz, Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan, Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman, Senate Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic, legislative sponsors, and state and community leaders who played essential roles in this achievement for Minnesota families. This legislation will ensure that Minnesotans can take the time they need to recover from a serious illness, care for a sick family member, or welcome a new child without losing a paycheck. The paid family and medical leave program will grow Minnesota's economy by helping Minnesotans stay in the workforce and boosting families' economic security. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to support national paid family and medical leave for families across the country and applauds states like Minnesota that have made significant progress in advancing comprehensive paid leave.
