    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2518, the "Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994."
This Act provides funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and several smaller agencies. Programs within these agencies address the training and employment needs of our Nation's work force, the Federal role in our education system, and fundamental elements of our health care network.
This Act provides funding for a number of my high-priority investment proposals within the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education. These include the Head Start program, Goals 2000 program, School-to-Work program, Immunization grants, and the National Institutes of Health.
The Act provides funding for investment initiatives for automation and disability processing within the Social Security Administration (SSA). This will help SSA improve the quality of service to millions of Americans.
I am pleased that the Act provides a large increase in funding for programs authorized under the Ryan White CARE Act. Programs authorized under this Act represent major steps forward in the battle against the AIDS epidemic.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 21, 1993.
