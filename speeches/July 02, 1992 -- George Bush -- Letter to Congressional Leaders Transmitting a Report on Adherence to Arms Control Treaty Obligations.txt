    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
I am pleased to transmit a report on the adherence of the United States to arms control treaty obligations and on problems related to compliance by other nations with the provisions of arms control agreements to which the United States is a party. I am transmitting the classified and unclassified versions of the report.
This report was prepared by the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in coordination with the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy, as well as the Joint Staff and the Intelligence Community.
The United States will continue to make clear that it expects scrupulous compliance from its arms control treaty partners and that full compliance is essential to a meaningful arms controls process. For its part, the United States will continue to take seriously its commitments to arms control agreements, to set rigid standards and detailed procedures for assuring that it meets these obligations, and to correct any errors in U.S. implementation that arise.
Sincerely,
George Bush
