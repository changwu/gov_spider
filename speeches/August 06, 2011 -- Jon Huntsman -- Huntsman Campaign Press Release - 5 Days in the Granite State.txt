    We just wrapped up Governor Jon Huntsman's trip to New Hampshire and it's been a very eventful week.
On Monday morning, we headed over to Manchester to meet with inventor Dean Kamen (of Segway fame) and took a tour of his research and development firm DEKA , followed by a visit to the non-profit he started called FIRST. Together, both ventures employ over 500 Granite Staters.
At the end of the tour, Jon had the opportunity to speak with some students and summer campers about their work at FIRST-- a science education non-profit that uses robotics competitions to inspire more than 251,000 students across the globe.
Later in the afternoon, Jon headed to Rochester for a house party hosted by the Rochester Republican City Committee and followed it up with another great house party with local supporters in Dover the following night.
Perhaps the highlight of the trip was our walk down Elm Street in Manchester with Mayor Gatsas, stopping in at local favorites from Ben and Jerry's to the Portland Pie Company. One of the best moments was at the Music & Arts store when Jon couldn't resist the urge to bang out a tune on the ivories:

Jon also spoke to both the Nashua and Salem Chambers of Commerce and answered their questions on how we can move this economy forward and create jobs in our communities.
Overall, it's been a great week in New Hampshire and we've heard lots of good things from supporters across the Granite State. From Bob J. in Rochester who said Governor Huntsman "moved up considerably over an awful lot of other people in this race," to Carol W. from Newmarket who said, "I'm impressed with him so far." Everyone's looking forward to Jon's next visit.
