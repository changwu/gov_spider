    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through September 30, 1995. The current submission covers the period October 1, 1995, through November 30, 1995.
The focus of my Administration's activity during this reporting period was preparations for the December trip to Cyprus of my Special Emissary, Richard Beattie. Mr. Beattie's travel reflects my interest in intensifying United States Government efforts to achieve progress towards an intercommunal settlement. His ongoing work supports the U.N.-led effort to attain lasting peace on the island. Consultations with the parties confirmed that security has not diminished as a key concern for both sides.
With respect to Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession process, in discussions with European officials and others, my representatives continued to urge that the EU engage both communities regularly to explain what EU membership would mean for a federal Cyprus state. Such dialogue would encourage the parties to use the period before accession negotiations to establish a bizonal, bicommunal federation that could ultimately enter the EU.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
