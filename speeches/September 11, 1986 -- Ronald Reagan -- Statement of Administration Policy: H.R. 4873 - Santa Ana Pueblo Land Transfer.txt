    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Richardson (R), Lujan (D), and Skeen (D) New Mexico)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4873 because section 1 of the bill transfers the mineral estate of some 494 acres in Sandoval County, New Mexico, worth approximately $3.75 million, from the Federal Government to the Santa Ana Pueblo without any compensation to the Federal Government.
