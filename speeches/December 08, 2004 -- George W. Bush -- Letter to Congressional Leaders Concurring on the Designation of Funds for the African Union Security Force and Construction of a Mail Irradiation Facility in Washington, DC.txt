    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby concur with the Congress in the designation of two provisions totaling $100 million provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (H.R. 4818), as emergency requirements.
These funds are necessary to support the African Union security force in Darfur, as well as to construct a mail irradiation facility in Washington, D.C. Additional information is set forth in the attached letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
