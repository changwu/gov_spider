    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Nickles (R) Oklahoma and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration supports enactment of S.J. Res. 6, which would overturn the recently issued "ergonomics" program standard designed to address injuries caused by repetitive motion or overexertion. These regulations would cost employers, large and small, billions of dollars annually while providing uncertain benefits. If implemented, they would require employers to establish burdensome and costly new systems intended to track, prevent, and provide compensation for an extremely broad class of injuries whose cause is subject to considerable dispute.
In addition, a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences found that none of the common musculoskeletal disorders are uniquely caused by work exposures. A number of outside analyses have shown that compliance with this standard could cost employers significantly more than the $4.5 billion estimated by OSHA. Finally, this program standard is so vague and cumbersome that employers, particularly small business owners, would face an overwhelming challenge in attempting to comply.
