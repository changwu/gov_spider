    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/26/92)(House)(Miller (D) CA and 12 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 306. Although the 1942 explosion at Port Chicago was a tragedy, the Administration believes that other national memorials already commemorate World War II veterans. The National Park Service has not studied this site to determine its national significance or its suitability for designation as a unit of the National Park System. Moreover, the site is an operational naval facility with limited public access.
