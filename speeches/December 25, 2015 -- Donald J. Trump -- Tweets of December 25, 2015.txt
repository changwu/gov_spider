Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!Retweets: 3053Favorites: 8560

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.Retweets: 2169Favorites: 6552

@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!Retweets: 1355Favorites: 3129

.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!Retweets: 1695Favorites: 6108

The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.Retweets: 5023Favorites: 12650
