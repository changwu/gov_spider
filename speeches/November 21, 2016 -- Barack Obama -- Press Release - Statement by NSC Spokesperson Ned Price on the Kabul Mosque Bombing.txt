    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack today at the Baqir-ul-Olum Mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan, which killed dozens of innocent civilians, many of them worshipers, and wounded more than 40. This cowardly attack was clearly intended to stoke sectarian tensions in Afghanistan. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this attack and fully support efforts to bring those responsible to justice. The United States and our international partners remain committed to the people and Government of Afghanistan as we work together to build a more stable and prosperous peaceful Afghanistan.
