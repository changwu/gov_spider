    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement today:
"My presidential campaign has defied the odds, and will continue to do so, as we head into the Super Tuesday primaries, proving the power of message over money and mechanics. I believe the record will show that mine has been one of the most cost-effective presidential campaigns in recent history -- at a time when the campaign season has been the longest. This affirms what I have always known, that this country is not for sale and the office of president cannot be bought.
"My campaign filed our year-end 2007 FEC report in compliance with federal law -- and all of the details are available online. While my fund-raising has increased significantly, with each quarter outperforming the previous one, a majority of my donors are a part of a grassroots army of concerned citizens from across America -- individuals who may have limited financial means but who care about this country deeply and are giving what they can to support my campaign.
"At every juncture, I've been amazed at the power of the people, who represent the core strength and values of this country. I am deeply appreciative of their support, which has fueled my candidacy and will continue to power our campaign in the weeks and months ahead."
