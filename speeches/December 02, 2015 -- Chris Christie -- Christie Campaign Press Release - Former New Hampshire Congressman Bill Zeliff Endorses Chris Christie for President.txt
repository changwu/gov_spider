For Immediate Release:

MORRISTOWN, NJ - Citing his record of strong leadership on national security and fiscal reform, former New Hampshire Congressman Bill Zeliff has endorsed Governor Chris Christie for President of the United States.
"Governor Christie is the tough, no-nonsense leader we need in Washington to reform our broken budget process and get our government working for the people again," said Zeliff, who has been a champion of budget reform initiatives since his election to Congress in 1990 and authored the "A to Z Budget Cutting Tool" for House members during the 1990s.
"As a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted terrorism cases and a governor who works with a legislature of the opposing party, Governor Christie has the broad experience to be our next commander-in-chief. Governor Christie had the fortitude to be the first candidate in this race to present detailed, concrete plans to reform our federal entitlement programs, grow our economy, and restore our role as a world leader on international affairs. I am endorsing Chris Christie because he will be ready to lead on Day One."
Zeliff's long history of leadership in New Hampshire includes serving as a delegate to the Republican National Convention nominating George H.W. Bush in 1988, service in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1991 to 1997 where he was elected Chairman of the Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and Criminal Justice, worked on the Republican Leadership Team as Deputy Whip, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire in 1996. Zeliff is a U.S. Army Reserve veteran and the former co-owner/innkeeper of the Christmas Farm Inn in Jackson, New Hampshire and was granted the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association's Annual Innkeeper of the Year Award in 1987 for the state of New Hampshire.
