    Locke Will Serve As Washington Co-Chair and Co-Chair of Campaign's Technology and Telecom Working Group
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Washington Governor Gary Locke, and named him Washington Co-Chair, Co-Chair of the Campaign's Technology and Telecom Working Group and a member of the Campaign's National Governors Council.
"Hillary Clinton can deliver the change this country needs," Locke said. "Only Hillary has the breadth of experience, the knowledge and the skills necessary to lead our country at a time when leadership is so sorely needed."
"Gary was a visionary governor and he will be a tremendous asset to our campaign as we take our message of change across Washington," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support."
Locke served as Governor of Washington from 1997-2005, raising academic achievement in public schools, strengthening the state's economy and expanding access to affordable health care. He was the first Chinese American governor in U.S. history.
Under his leadership, Washington was named one of the five best managed states in the country by Governing Magazine, a finalist in the Harvard Innovations in Government program, and as the most Digital State Government.
Locke earned a national profile in 2003 when he delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Union address and served as chairman of the Democratic Governor's Association.
Prior to being elected Governor, Locke served as King County Executive from 1994-1997 and in the State House of Representatives from 1983-1994, where he chaired the Appropriations Committee. He began his career as a Deputy Criminal Prosecutor in King County from 1976-1980.
Locke is currently a partner at the law firm of Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle.
He joins King County Executive Ron Sims and Congressman Jay Inslee as Washington Co-Chairs.
