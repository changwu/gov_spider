    The President. Well, I'm happy to have the House and Senate leadership here. You can see Senator McConnell and Leader McCarthy and Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer. And what we're going to talk about today is—you know, when I ran, I said: "I wasn't going to be a Democratic President. I was going to be a President for all Americans."
And what the bottom line here is: We're going to see whether we can reach some consensus on a compromise on moving forward. And we're going to talk a lot about infrastructure today to see if there's any way we can reach a compromise that gets the people's work done and is within the bounds of everyone agreeing. And that's the purpose of this meeting.
Not much more to say right now, but we'll—we're going to get going. That's it.

Q. Mr. President, you know what is happening with Kevin McCarthy and his leadership? Can you trust him and work with him?
The President. Yes. [Laughter] Come on, guys.
Q. On inflation, though——
