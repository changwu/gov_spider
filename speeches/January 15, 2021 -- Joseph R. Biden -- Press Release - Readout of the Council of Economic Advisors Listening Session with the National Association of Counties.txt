    Council of Economic Advisors Chair-designate Cecilia Rouse, and Members-designate Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey met this morning for a listening session with the National Association of Counties (NACo), the only national organization that represents county governments in the United States. The conversation focused on the impact of COVID in local communities, and the importance of direct federal support during this critical time.
The CEA designates listened to NACo's membership concerns and discussed the impact of COVID-19 in communities across the U.S., and the critical role counties play in supporting local services and priorities, including infrastructure, workforce, housing, and health care.
