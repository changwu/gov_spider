    I know I speak on behalf of the Nation when I express a sense of outrage and sadness at the senseless killings today of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.
George Moscone had long and ably served the people of the San Francisco area. At age 33 he became one of the youngest members ever elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He was elected three times to the California State Senate before becoming San Francisco's mayor in 1976.
In every conversation with Mayor Moscone, I always knew that the people of San Francisco and California were uppermost in his mind and heart. He was a good and kind man, and he will be sorely missed.
Supervisor Milk was a hard-working and dedicated supervisor, a leader of San Francisco's gay community who kept his promise to represent all his constituents.
Rosalynn and I express our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of both men.
