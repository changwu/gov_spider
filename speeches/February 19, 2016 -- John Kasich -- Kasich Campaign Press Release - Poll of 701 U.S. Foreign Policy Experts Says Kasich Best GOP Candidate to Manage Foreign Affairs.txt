This snap poll — conducted by the Teaching, Research & International Policy (TRIP) project at the College of William & Mary, in collaboration with Foreign Policy — asked IR scholars 10 questions about contemporary international issues. This poll is the eighth in the series and includes responses from 701 of the 4,078 IR scholars currently teaching and/or researching at colleges and universities throughout the United States.
At 54 percent, the majority of scholars chose Ohio Governor John Kasich, followed by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who garnered the support of just under 30 percent of respondents. Interestingly, no other Republican candidate broke out of single digits with IR scholars. Despite strong support in national and state public opinion polls, just 1.7 percent of IR scholars selected real estate mogul Donald Trump, while 1.5 percent selected Sen. Ted Cruz.
