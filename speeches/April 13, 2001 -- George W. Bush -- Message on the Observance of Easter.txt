    I am pleased to send warm greetings to all those observing Easter. On this day, Christians around the world join in celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and Son of Man.
For Christians everywhere, Easter is a day when, in the words of the ancient Exultet hymn, the earth "rejoices in shining splendor, radiant in the brightness of its King." It is a time to be humbled by and grateful for God's sacrifice and boundless love and to rejoice in the sheer wonder of life and the promise of victory over death.
Easter comes at the end of the Lenten season, a period of penitence and solemnity in many Christian traditions. The Lenten season prepares Christ's followers for the joyous affirmation that "Christ is Risen!" Holy Week activities, including Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, and Good Friday, remind the faithful of the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.
Many traditions associated with Easter have become a part of our American way of life. Although these customs may differ, the universal message of Easter draws all Christian communities together. As families and friends gather to celebrate, we renew our commitment to follow the example of Jesus Christ in loving our neighbors and giving of ourselves for others. On this joyous day, let us also remember all those in need and those Christians around the world who are persecuted for their faith.
Laura joins me in sending best wishes for a wonderful Easter.
