    Sarah Huckabee Sanders is joining Gov. Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign as senior political advisor. She begins her new role in the campaign's Iowa headquarters today, taking the lead for the campaign on the Iowa Straw Poll effort with a focus on expanding the campaign's grassroots operations across the first-in-the-nation caucus state.
"Sarah is a results-oriented person with a great track record in Iowa and around the country," Gov. Pawlenty said. "We are very excited Sarah is joining our team just as we are hitting our stride in Iowa."
"I'm delighted to join the Governor and First Lady in Iowa, which holds a special place in my heart," Sanders said. "It's clear to me that Gov. Pawlenty has what it takes to unite the party, unite the country and beat President Obama."
In 2007-08, Sarah Huckabee Sanders helped lead her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, to victory in the Iowa caucuses as his national political director. In 2010, she was campaign manager for John Boozman's successful U.S. Senate campaign in Arkansas. Sarah was recently named one of TIME Magazine's "40 under 40" and is widely recognized to be one of the best political operatives of her generation. Sarah is a full-time consultant with Tsamoutales Strategies, a transnational consulting firm.
