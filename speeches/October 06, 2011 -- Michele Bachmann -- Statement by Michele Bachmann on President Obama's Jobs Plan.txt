    Urbandale, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has issued the following statement in response to President Obama's jobs plan:
"The do-nothing President once again shifts responsibility to Congress for fixing the economy. Today, the President admitted his agenda is his re-election and not creating jobs in his assertion that he plans to 'campaign against them as a do-nothing Congress.' Mr. President — the Congress and the American people intend to 'act so aggressively' to end your job killing economic policies and end your time as President and begin growing our economy and creating jobs with pro-growth policies and, a President who understands it's the private sector that creates jobs. We need a President who will lead and not pass blame and responsibility to congress, world events or natural disasters.
"As President, I'll cut taxes, regulations, and spending, not increase them. I'll repeal the job killing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank bills. I won't waste taxpayer dollars paying back political donors on failed businesses like Solyndra or billions on other companies that will only create a few jobs. We can't afford any more of President Obama's jobs. I will lead with real solutions that will allow the private sector to grow and create thousands of jobs."
