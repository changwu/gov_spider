Urbandale, IA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum has released print ads in several major Iowa newspapers - including The Des Moines Register - declaring that he will not surrender America on Social Issues.
In the advertisement, Rick Santorum proclaims that as President, he will never call a truce on traditional American values, because he knows that a truce really means surrender. Rick Santorum will protect faith, family and freedom because he believes that's what makes America exceptional. It's not just our economic potential, it's the fact that our nation is a moral enterprise - and Rick Santorum will protect America's moral foundation, empower American families and build America's economic freedom.
