    THIS Sunday scores of Americans, including Members of the Congress, health and athletic associations, and the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, will join in celebrating "Walk a Mile for Your Health Day." I heartily join in saluting this observance.
Whether out of habit or inclination, millions of men and women in this country do not reap the benefits that simple walking will provide. Yet beyond the obvious health benefits of walking, I know from personal experience that long walks are refreshing exercises of the mind as well as the body. It offers time for reflection and time for personal thought.
"Walk a Mile for Your Health Day" this weekend is an opportunity for all Americans to recognize the many health benefits of walking. It is my hope that we will continue this and other important physical fitness programs on every day thereafter.
