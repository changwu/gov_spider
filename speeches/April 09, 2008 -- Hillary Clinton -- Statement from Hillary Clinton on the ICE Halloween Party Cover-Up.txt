    Today the House Committee on Homeland Security released a report that found evidence of a cover-up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) senior officials, including Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for ICE Julie Myers, relating to evidence of racist and inappropriate activities during a Halloween party attended by these officials. Senator Clinton issued the following statement:
"I continue to be appalled about the inappropriate and racially insensitive activities that took place within our nation's highest immigration enforcement entity, and am outraged that there was an effort to cover these incidents up. I have consistently called for a change of tone in the immigration debate and this incident points to the urgent need for that to happen. When the officials who are in charge of enforcing immigration laws display these kinds of prejudice, they become part of the problem instead of part of the solution. It's time for this Administration to hold its public servants accountable."
