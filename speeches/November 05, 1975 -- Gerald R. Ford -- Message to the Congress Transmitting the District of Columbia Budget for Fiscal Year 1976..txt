    To the Congress of the United States:
I am today transmitting for your consideration the budget of the District of Columbia for fiscal year 1976 and for the transition period July 1, 1976, through September 30,1976.
This budget is the first prepared by the city government in full exercise of its powers under the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act. It reflects the results of a constructive city budget process which included participation by many District citizens. As such, this Home Rule budget represents a cornerstone of responsible city government and confirms the strength of a Federal-local partnership in the administration of Washington, D.C.
This budget also carries the Nation's Capital and the District community through the peak of our Nation's Bicentennial observance. I urge the Congress to review these proposals with the knowledge that Washington will be a focal point for the national celebration and that the city will be visited by greater numbers of American and foreign visitors than ever before. At the same time, residents of Washington, who also take pride in their own community, plan local observances just as other cities do across the country. It is, therefore, important that the Congress act promptly on the District Budget for 1976.
