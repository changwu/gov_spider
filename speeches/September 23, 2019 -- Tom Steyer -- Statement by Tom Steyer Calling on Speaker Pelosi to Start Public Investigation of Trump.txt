    (SAN FRANCISCO, September 23, 2019) â€” Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the statement below after allegations that Donald Trump pressed the Ukrainian President to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of his political rival, in exchange for access to $250 million in previously frozen funds:
"Once again it appears Donald Trump has asked a foreign power to interfere in our elections and provide information against a political opponent. For far too long, Speaker Pelosi and the House Democratic Leadership have stood by while this lawless president continues this type of criminal behavior. They are failing in their basic duty to oversee the Executive, and their lack of action enables Trump to continue to threaten our democracy. Enough is enough. Congress must start an immediate and public investigation, with daily hearings into these allegations. History will remember how Congress responds to this moment, and it cannot be complicit with its silence.
I started Need to Impeach almost two years ago because I believed it was important to protect our country from this lawless president, and I am renewing my call to start impeachment hearings. It is time for Speaker Pelosi to launch a public inquiry into President Trump and his criminal actions right away. He must be held accountable for his crimes."
