    New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said today that moving the California Presidential primary election to February 5 is good for the Democratic Party and the primary process in general. The Governor issued the following statement:
"I believe that this change is great for the west and a positive development for my campaign," said Governor Richardson. "I am confident that my message and strong record of action will resonate with the voters of California. As a western Governor I deal every day with issues important to the region, fighting for equal rights, protecting our environment, and promoting aggressive renewable energy policies and energy independence. And like New Mexico, California is a diverse, multicultural state that will help the nominating process become even more inclusive and more reflective of America as it is today and will be in the future."
