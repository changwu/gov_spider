    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to section 123d of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153), as amended, the text of the proposed amendment to the Agreement for Cooperation Between the United States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The proposed amendment is accompanied by these items:
—My written determination, approval and authorization concerning the Agreement;
—The memorandum of the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement concerning the amendment;
—The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and Energy, which includes a summary of the provisions of the amendment; and
—The views of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The United States began negotiating for the proposed amendment in late 1977. This was done in anticipation of the passage of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which calls upon me to renegotiate existing agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation so as to bring them into line. with the Act's provisions. In my judgment the United States-IAEA agreement will meet all Statutory requirements once this amendment is added.
The IAEA is a key element in the framework of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and I am pleased to forward an amendment designed to strengthen our cooperation with the Agency. The proposed amendment will, in my view, further the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States.
I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested agencies in reviewing the proposed amendment and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved the agreement and authorized its execution, and I urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.
