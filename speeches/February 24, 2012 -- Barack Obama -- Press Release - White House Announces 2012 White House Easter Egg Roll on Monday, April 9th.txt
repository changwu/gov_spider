    The President and First Lady announced today that this year's White House Easter Egg Roll will be held on Monday, April 9, 2012. The event will feature live music, sports courts, cooking stations, storytelling and, of course, Easter egg rolling. Tied in to the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative, a national campaign to combat childhood obesity, all of the activities will encourage children to lead healthy and active lives. The White House will open its South Lawn to children aged 13 years and younger and their families.
White House Easter Egg Roll tickets will be distributed through an online lottery system, allowing guests from across the United States to participate in a tradition that dates back to 1878. The lottery will open for entries on March 1st at 10:00am and close on March 5th at 10:00am. Full ticketing details will be available on March 1st at www.whitehouse.gov/eastereggroll.
