    Dear Mr.___________:
I am transmitting herewith a bill to provide for an Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Department of Labor. This bill will better enable the Department of Labor to meet its increasing responsibilities in connection with the growing role of women in the work force of the Nation. In the next decade it is estimated that there will be an increase in that work force of 25 percent. This will require special attention and special emphasis upon the programs devoted to them.
I am enclosing, also, a letter from the Secretary of Labor describing the need for the bill.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
NOTE This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the Senate, and to the Honorable Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The President approved a bill providing for an additional Assistant Secretary of Labor on August II, 1961 (Public Law 87-137, 75 Stat. 338). Secretary Goldberg's letter was also released.
