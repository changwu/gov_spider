    This legislation is unacceptable. It is an injustice to the working people of this country.
The bill passed by the House is a fair one and one that I and the American people can support. I hope and expect that a reasonable bill will emerge from the conference committee and be approved by both Houses.
I look forward to signing legislation that provides adequate production incentives while protecting the interests of American consumers. I will not sign an unfair bill.
