    Presidential Determination No. 96-56
Memorandum for the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense
Subject: Determination to Authorize the Drawdown of Commodities, Services, and Training from the Department of Defense for the Economic Community of West African States' Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) Under Section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as Amended
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348(c)(2) ("the Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national interests of the United States; and
(2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown from the inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $10 million in commodities and services to provide assistance to states currently participating (Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Mali), and for those states that may in the future participate, in ECOMOG to enhance ECOMOG's peacekeeping capabilities to bring about a peaceful solution to the crisis in Liberia.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
