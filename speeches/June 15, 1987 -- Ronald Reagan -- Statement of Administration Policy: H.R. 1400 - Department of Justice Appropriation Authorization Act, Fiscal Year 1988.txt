    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rodino (D) New Jersey)
The administration opposes House passage of H.R. 1400 unless it is amended to delete the following unwarranted or unnecessary provisions:

— prohibiting authorized appropriations from being used to alter the per se prohibition against resale price maintenance (section 13);
— prohibiting the Department from using any authorized appropriations until it submits numerous reports and plans to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (section 15);
— requiring that various immigration fees be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts (section 14) because existing law already provides for the budgetary treatment of such receipts; and
— preventing the Department from proceeding in the name of the United States in litigation in which it disputes the constitutionality of an Act of Congress (section 12). 
In addition, H.R. 1400 should be amended to conform (1) the appropriation authorizations with those proposed in the President's 1988 Budget and (2) the permanent authorities with those proposed by the Department, all of which ate contained in H.R. 902 as introduced.
