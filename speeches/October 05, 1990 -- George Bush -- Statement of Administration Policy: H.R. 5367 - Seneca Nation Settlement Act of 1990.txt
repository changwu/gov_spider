    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Houghton (R) New York)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 5367 because it requires an unnecessary Federal payment of $35 million to the Seneca Indian Nation to resolve a dispute that exists between the Indian community, the City of Salamanca, and the State of New York.
H.R. 5367 requires the United States and the State of New York to compensate the Seneca Nation for a 1890 lease arrangement approved by Congress. The bill provides no justification for the $35 million Federal payment, which was negotiated without Executive Branch participation and represents more than half of the total settlement. Furthermore, the United States has already compensated the Seneca Nation for any impropriety relating to the lease arrangement, and should not be expected to provide further substantial funding to settle a local issue. The Department of Justice advises that the United States has no further legal liability for the lease arrangement.
