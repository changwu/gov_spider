    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Republican Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee received the endorsement of the Republican Sportshooters Association at a sportsmen's "meet and greet and skeet shoot" just outside Spartanburg, South Carolina yesterday.
"The Second Amendment is not about loving guns, it is about ensuring freedom," said Huckabee.
During his remarks, Huckabee told the crowd the story about the rusty old 20 gauge shotgun in his rifle cabinet at home that was his father's gun, and how one day that gun will be his sons. "You don't hear stories about fathers passing down video games to their sons," he quipped.
Wayne Wilkinson, President of the Republican Sportshooters Association, stated: "Mike Huckabee is the authentic consistent conservative, who shares our love of faith, family and freedom. The preservation, promotion, and protection of faith, family, and freedom is the mission of the Republican Sportshooters Association. It is our honor to endorse a candidate who shares our mission and shares our values."
Huckabee, an ardent supporter of the Second Amendment, was named one of Outdoor Life Magazine's "25 Most Influential Hunters and Fishermen" earlier this month.
He also has an A+ from the National Rifle Association, an organization in which he has been a lifelong member. Last year, Huckabee won the prestigious One Shot Antelope Shot in Lander, Wyoming – along with National Wild Turkey Federation President Rob Keck and Ranger Boats Founder Forrest Wood.
Huckabee picked up the endorsement after nearly 24-hours of non-stop campaigning in South Carolina, which included attending Saturday's Clemson-South Carolina football game, speaking at two church services, attending a reception at the home of State Senator David Thomas in Greenville, and skeet shooting (with his wife Janet) at the sportsmen's event in Spartanburg on Sunday.
