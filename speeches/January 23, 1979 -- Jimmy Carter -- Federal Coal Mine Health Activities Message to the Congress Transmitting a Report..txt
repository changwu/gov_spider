    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1977 Annual Report of Health Activities under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.
The Report, prepared by HEW's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Center for Disease Control, Public Health Service, describes the coal mine health research conducted by the Institute, as well as the Institute's medical examination program for coal miners required by the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended in 1977.
I recommend that, in order to save HEW staff resources and time, the statutory reporting requirement for this report be changed from once every year to once every three years. All of the information contained in this 'Report is available to Congress during annual appropriations and oversight hearings, and HEW will inform Congress immediately of any scientific breakthroughs in the field.
