    The Hillary Clinton for President Campaign announced Friday that Virginia Assembly Delegates Adam Ebbin and Jennifer McClellan have endorsed Hillary's candidacy for President. McClellan is also a Democratic National Committee member.
"For decades, Hillary Clinton has been a national champion for our children's health care and education," said Ebbin. "We need someone with her proven experience and track record in Washington, and Hillary has the experience and knowledge to make change happen."
Elected in 2003, Virginia State Delegate Adam Ebbin represents the 49th House District of Virginia, which includes large portions of Arlington and Alexandria. He serves on the Education, Transportation and Health, Welfare and Institutions Committees, and is the former Chief Deputy Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry.
Jennifer McClellan has represented the greater Richmond area in the 71st District of Virginia, which she has served since 2005. She is a member of the House Commerce & Labor and Education Committees, and was appointed by Governor Kaine to serve on the Commission on Sexual Violence. ###
