1. The article that made Hillary stop and say, "What?!"
2. Take notice: Hillary?"will not be silenced" on gun violence.?

3. Hillary was the only candidate to defend Planned Parenthood and reproductive rights during the Democratic debate. We were glad she did—and apparently we weren't the only ones.
4. We learned just how versatile one word can be. (Thanks, BuzzFeed.)?

You can download the GIF, just in case you ever need it (trust us, you will).

  Okay Hillary Clinton on Buzzfeed's Another Round podcast to DELIGHTFUL. If you didn't already have a crush on her, you will.— pru (@oftenimprudent) October 12, 2015

6. Jennifer Lawrence stands up for equal pay, an issue near and dear to Hillary's heart.?
7. And speaking of equal pay: this week was Latina Equal Pay Day—the day that marks how much further into a new year a Latina must work on average to make the same amount of money a white man made during the previous year. The American Association of University Women provides an in-depth look at how the gender pay gap affects women of color.


  #LatinaEqualPay Day represents the day Latinas catch up to white men's earnings from last year. It's October. We need equal pay for all.— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 15, 2015

8. If you're not sure who Lorella Praeli is, you should definitely get to know her.?
9. Pharrell goes on Ellen and declares it "Hillary time." We couldn't agree more.?
