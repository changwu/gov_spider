    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Spence (R) South Carolina and 2 Others)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1350.
The Administration will, however, seek amendments to assure that (1) the bill conforms to any applicable international agreement concerning shipbuilding subsidies to which the United States may become a party; and (2) procedures for providing reemployment rights for certain merchant seamen are consistent with those under the Uniformed Services Employment And Reemployment Rights Act (Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 43).
