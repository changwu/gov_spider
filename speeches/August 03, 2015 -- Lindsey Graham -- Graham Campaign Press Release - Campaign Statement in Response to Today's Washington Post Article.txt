    Alexandria, VA — In response to today's article in The Washington Post, campaign manager Christian Ferry, today released the following statement:
"The article in The Washington Post is nothing but a political hit job of the very worse kind. Using anonymous sources and salacious headlines, The Washington Post has buried the truth of Senator Graham's distinguished and honorable service in the United States Air Force.
While the headline claims Graham served 'light duties,' the article notes he spent 142 days deployed during his time in Congress, mostly in Iraq and Afghanistan. While a subheading notes a 'no show assignment,' it is describing his decision to serve duty in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Additionally, the article notes retired general officers describing Graham as 'really talented,' 'in the top 1% of his peer group,' and 'a national treasure.' The Post has chosen to bury the facts behind quotes from unnamed sources and absurd, un-representative headlines to generate clicks and sell newspapers. It is journalism at its worse.
As Christopher Burne, the Judge Advocate General of the US Air Force said upon Senator Graham's retirement in June, 'Colonel Graham has faithfully served our nation for 33 years. He built a legendary reputation as Captain Graham. I could go on about Colonel Graham's integrity, service before self and excellence. These are his hallmark traits and they have not changed in 33 years.'
The bottom line is, Senator Graham served his country with honor. For his service in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Air Force awarded him both the Meritorious Service Medal and the Bronze Star. The article is nothing but irresponsible."
