Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the endorsement of two additional Iowa House members, Representative Rich Anderson (R-Clarinda) and Representative Chuck Soderberg (R-Le Mars). They join 14 previously announced Iowa state legislators, making Governor Romney the candidate with the most legislative endorsements in Iowa.
"Representatives Anderson and Soderberg represent the kind of conservative leadership we need in government," said Governor Romney. "They have fought to promote fiscal responsibility and conservative values in Iowa, and their support will be critical to my campaign. Together, we will work to make sure America is strong for generations to come."
With today's announcement, Representative Rich Anderson said, "There is not a more qualified candidate for President than Governor Romney. The combination of his business, volunteer and governing experience makes him the strongest leader in the field. His message is resonating with voters in Iowa, and his campaign will continue to grow as more voters have the opportunity to hear his optimistic message."
Representative Chuck Soderberg added, "Governor Romney shares my conservative principles and values, and those of Iowa Republicans. Our nation needs a leader from outside of Washington who believes the way to make America stronger is to strengthen individuals and families, not government. Governor Romney has a proven record of accomplishment, and will be the strong leader our nation needs."
Both Representative Anderson and Representative Soderberg were elected to the Iowa House in 2004. They join 14 other members of the Legislature who have previously announced their support for Governor Romney.
