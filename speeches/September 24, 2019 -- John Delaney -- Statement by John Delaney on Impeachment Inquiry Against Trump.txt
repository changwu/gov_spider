    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD - John Delaney releases the following statement:
"Impeachment is a political process, which has historically been divisive and difficult on the morale of the country. It is a path no American, regardless of party, celebrates the country pursuing. Speaker Pelosi has exercised extremely good judgment on this question thus far, and I agree with her decision today to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry. She deserves our support. The President's behavior, combined with the administration's refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice. Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it. My hope is that we come out of these dark times stronger and more united as a country."
