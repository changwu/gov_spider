    Earlier today, President Obama called Chilean President Sebastian Pinera to congratulate him and the Chilean government on the historic rescue of the 33 miners trapped under more than 2,000 feet of rock in northern Chile since August 5. The President hailed the rescue as a tribute not only to the determination of the rescue workers and the Chilean government, but also the miners and the Chilean people who have inspired the world. President Pinera conveyed his thanks to the President, the United States government, and the American companies and individuals who provided support for the rescue efforts.
