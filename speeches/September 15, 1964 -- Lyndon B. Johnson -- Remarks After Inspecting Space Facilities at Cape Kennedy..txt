    Mr. Webb, ladies and gentlemen:
Thank you very much for giving me this great privilege to come here and observe the results of your labors. I have had a deep interest in this program for many years. I always get optimistic and ambitious and excited when I am permitted to come here and see the progress that you have made. I feel, as I know you feel, that I want only the best in the world for our great Nation and for our people.
I recognize, as I know you recognize, that we cannot be the leader of the world and the follower in space. For that reason, the taxpayers of our country are making great sacrifices in order that we can get on with the job, get ahead with our research, and come up with the answers.
I am so proud of the team that Mr. Webb has assembled. I am so grateful to each of you who make your own individual contribution to that team.
I came down here today with one of our great young Americans. I awarded him the Harmon Trophy yesterday in the Rose Garden at the White House--Major Cooper. He told me of some of the progress that you were making together as we flew down from Washington this morning on the plane. It gave me great pride to hear what he said, and it gives me great pleasure to see what you have done.
I want to commend each of you. I envy you. You are playing a part in history that your children and your grandchildren will be very proud to point to. I trust when all is said and done, that America will not only be the home of the free and the land of the brave, but will be the nation that is first in space, due primarily to what you people are doing here.
Thank you so much for the good work you are doing.
