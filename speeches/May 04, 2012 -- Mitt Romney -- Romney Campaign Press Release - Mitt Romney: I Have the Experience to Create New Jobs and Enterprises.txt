MITT ROMNEY: "I think it helps to have a president who's actually worked in the private sector, who's had a job and who's had the opportunity to help build enterprises and to see a vision for the future of what enterprises are likely to be successful. So, I've helped start some businesses, I've helped lead businesses, particularly those that were in trouble, and get them back on track. That kind of experience will certainly help in leading an economy that can create new jobs, new enterprises that put people to work with rising incomes. The President's a nice guy, but he's never had a job in the private sector. He's never created a job. I think it helps to have had a job to create a job."
