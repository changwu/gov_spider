    Yesterday, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published an advisory to warn United States financial institutions that senior foreign political figures connected to the regime of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may seek to transfer proceeds from acts of political corruption into the United States financial system. This advisory is a strong signal that the Administration of President Donald J. Trump will not tolerate the Ortega regime's continued indiscriminate use of violence, repressive tactics, and corruption, which have worsened the economic situation of Nicaragua's people. The United States calls for the peaceful restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua, which are foundational to long-term economic stability.
