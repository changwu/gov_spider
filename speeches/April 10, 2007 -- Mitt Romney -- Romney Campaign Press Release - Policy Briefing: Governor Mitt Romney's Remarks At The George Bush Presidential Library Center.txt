    Key Excerpts Of Governor Romney's Speech At The George Bush Presidential Library Center, College Station, Texas (As Prepared For Delivery):
Governor Romney: "We need leadership. We are fortunate today to have a President who loves America, who acts solely out of a desire to protect her and to promote liberty around the world. But I think most Americans look at Washington and are appalled at the divisiveness, the bitterness, the smallness, the disunity. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously opined that 'politics stops at the water's edge.' But last week, a committee chair said we have two foreign policies, one for each party. And then the Speaker of the House helped dignify a state sponsor of terror. At this time of war, her action stands as one of the most partisan, divisive, and ill-considered of any national leader in this decade."
Governor Romney: "Unity also means supporting our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The challenges there are immense. But President Bush and General Petraeus are implementing a new strategy for Iraq – and it deserves a chance to succeed. Running away from Iraq now would embolden our enemies, giving them the sanctuary they need to plan more devastating attacks against our country. In this difficult time, some in Congress are trying to deny our troops the resources they need. This is a grave error. We need to rally behind the effort, and support our men and women in uniform in this time of war."
Governor Romney: "I think many of us still fail to comprehend the extent of the threat posed by radical Islam, by Jihad. Understandably, we focus on Afghanistan and Iraq. Our men and women are dying there. We think in terms of countries, because we faced countries in last century's conflicts. But the Jihad is much broader than any one nation or nations. For radical Islam, there is one conflict and one goal – replacing all modern Islamic states with a caliphate, destroying America, and conquering the world."
Governor Romney's Four Changes Needed To Meet A New Generation Of Global Challenges:
First, We Need A Stronger Military. Our military suffered a dangerous decline under the Clinton Administration and has faced serious strains as we confront Jihadist threats following 9/11. To support our troops, we need to ensure we have the personnel and resources needed to maintain a strong America and safe world:
- We Must Increase The Size Of Our Military By 100,000 Troops.
- We Need To Dedicate At Least Four Percent Of Our Gross Domestic Product To Defense, Making Up For Critical Gaps In Our Military Modernization, Equipment, Personnel And Health Care Efforts.
- Investing In Our Military, We Need To Ensure Funds Are Used To Address Critical Needs And Support The Men And Women Of Our Armed Forces, Rather Than Political Or Contractor Interests.
Second, America Must Become Energy Independent. Our economic and military strength require that we end our strategic vulnerability to an oil shut-off by nations like Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, and that we address environmental concerns. To do this, Governor Romney has called for a bold and far-reaching research initiative - an Energy Revolution - to be our generation's equivalent of the Manhattan Project or the Moon mission. This will be a mission to create new, economic sources of clean energy.
Third, We Must Transform And Strengthen Our Civilian International Efforts To Meet A New Generation Of Challenges. Many of our civilian national security and foreign policy structures were created decades ago to confront Cold War threats. Building on the Goldwater-Nichols military reforms of the 1980s, we need to ensure that our civilian instruments of national power have the ability to build joint efforts among our civilian agencies and empower Regional Deputies with clear lines of authority, budgets and responsibility to develop and execute regional plans and strategies. We must also constantly challenge bureaucratic "group think" and revitalize our national security structures so we have the capabilities needed to meet 21st century challenges.
Fourth, We Need To Strengthen Old Partnerships And Alliances, And Inaugurate A New One, To Address The Threat Of Jihadism. The failures of efforts such as the United Nations Human Rights Council have given multilateralism a bad name. But America's strength is amplified when it is combined with the strength of other nations. We need to look to expand alliances such as NATO to face the new threat of radical Jihad and increase our homeland security.
- In The Struggle Against Jihadism, One Of The Greatest Challenges Is The Looming Demographic Crisis In The Broader Middle East Combined With Rising Unemployment. As President, Governor Romney will call together our Middle East allies and the major nations of the developed world to address these issues by establishing a Partnership for Hope and Prosperity. This Partnership would assemble the resources of all developed nations to assure that threatened Islamic states have public schools, micro credit and banking, the rule of law, human rights, basic health care, and competitive economic policies. Resources would be drawn from public and private institutions, and from volunteers and NGOs. Its policies would favor expansion of free trade and investment.
