    PLEASE convey my personal greetings to all those attending tonight's commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Marshall plan.
The Marshall plan succeeded because it was conceived and operated on a scale commensurate with the task. It was an extraordinary reply to an extraordinary challenge. All those who translated this imaginative concept into concrete results can look with satisfaction tonight on the feats they achieved and the honor which they have earned.
Now we face another extraordinary challenge-the task of helping the awakening nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America catch up with the 20th century. Here, once again, a half-hearted response will not do-and I take heart in the knowledge that many of those who helped to win the great victory over "hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos" in Western Europe are still fighting a good fight for freedom.
My very best wishes to all of you on this memorable evening.
