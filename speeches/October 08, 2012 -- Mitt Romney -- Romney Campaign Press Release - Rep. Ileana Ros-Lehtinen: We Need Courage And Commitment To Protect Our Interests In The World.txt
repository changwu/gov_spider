    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"From the onset, President Obama has undermined U.S. interests in Latin America and the President's approach has been to treat our adversaries with kid gloves while turning his back on our allies in the region. A Romney administration will stand by those people who seek true freedom and democracy and condemn those regimes that continue to oppress theirpeople. We must maintain firm ties with those who share our values and priorities in order to empower and strengthen them, matching loyalty with loyalty. It takes courage and commitment to protect our security interests in the Hemisphere, a clear vision and ideological compass based on a full understanding of U.S. economic, political, and security needs in the region. You then need decisive actions to root out the mutual threats we face. Mitt Romney will provide such leadership."
