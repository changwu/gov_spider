Members of the U.S. Armed Forces
Ms. Ryan. When you look at these young players and the seniors, and you know that they enrolled in the academies after 9/11, what does that say about them?
The President. I stand in awe of somebody who would volunteer to serve America in a time of danger. It says that we are blessed to have people of such character in our country.
The Presidency
Ms. Ryan. Mr. President, I know you're probably doing a lot of reflecting here on December 6. What will you miss the most about being President?
The President. I will miss a lot of things. But one of the things I have treasured the most is to be the Commander in Chief of men and women of courage and character and decency.
Ms. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. President.
