    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act"), with respect to a further 12-month extension of the authority to waive subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my recommendation to continue in effect this waiver authority for a further 12-month period, and includes my reasons for determining that continuation of the waiver authority and the waiver currently in effect for Vietnam will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
