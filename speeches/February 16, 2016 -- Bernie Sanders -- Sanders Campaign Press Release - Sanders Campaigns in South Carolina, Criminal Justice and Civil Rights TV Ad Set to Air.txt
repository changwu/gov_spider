Bernie Sanders brought his White House campaign back to South Carolina on Tuesday with two morning stops in Columbia and an afternoon town meeting here where he predicted his come-from-behind campaign will surprise pundits when Palmetto State Democrats go to the polls on Feb. 27.
"On Election Day, I think folks here in South Carolina are going to wake up the next morning and find a very big surprise," Sanders said to cheers from supporters at the historic Memminger Auditorium.
Earlier Tuesday, Sanders spoke at a prayer breakfast at the historically black Allen University about his proposals on a range of issues from reforming the criminal justice system to creating jobs and raising wages.

Speaking to a mostly-student audience at the University of South Carolina, Sanders detailed proposals for tuition-free public colleges and universities. He also detailed plans to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges with a five-year, $1 trillion investment in infrastructure improvements.
Sanders was introduced at the university by Erica Garner, whose father died when he was choked to death during an arrest two years by New York City police officers. She called Sanders a "fearless public servant that is not afraid to stand against the establishment for the people."
Erica Garner is featured in a new television ad set to air here in a six-figure ad buy on stations in South Carolina and on national television beginning Wednesday.

The campaign day in South Carolina followed Sanders' 22-point victory one week ago in New Hampshire and a tie in the Feb. 1 Iowa precinct caucuses.
