    Today, results of a national survey were announced by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that found 83 percent of likely African-American voters view Hillary Clinton favorably. That was the highest favorable rating -- by more than 10 points -- of any candidate running.
In response to the survey results, Hillary Clinton made the following statement:
"I am grateful that African American voters are supporting my candidacy for President and see this campaign as hope for their future. These results are a result of my long term commitment to equality and bringing equal opportunities to African Americans. I believe this country can do better, and will do better in the future. The fight for equal rights never ends."
"I am also grateful that African American voters recognize that I will never give up on this battle. As a college student, in 1970, I spent my summer in South Carolina at the Washington Research Project helping improve the education and health of disadvantaged children. I will never stop advocating for the disadvantaged in our society. I am committed to improving the quality of life for the less fortunate. Working together, we can make a difference for our children, for parents, for our future."
