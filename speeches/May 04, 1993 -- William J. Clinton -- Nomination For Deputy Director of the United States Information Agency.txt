    The President today announced his intention to nominate Penn Kemble, Board for International Broadcasting member and a longtime advocate of democracy abroad, as Deputy Director of the United States Information Agency. Mr. Kemble will serve as Deputy to Joseph Duffey, recently named by the President as Director of USIA.
"Throughout his career, Penn Kemble has worked hard to promote the cause of freedom abroad," the President said. "I am certain he and Joe Duffey will work well together to use all of USIA's resources to continue pursuing that ideal."
