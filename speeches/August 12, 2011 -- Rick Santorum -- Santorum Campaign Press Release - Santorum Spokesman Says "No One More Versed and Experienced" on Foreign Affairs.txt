    U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett, R-South Carolina, who is chairman of Rick Santorum's presidential campaign in his state, told reporters after the Fox News debate that the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania had a good night.
"I thought Rick did a fantastic job," Gresham said. "I thought his statement that this is about leadership, not showmanship, I thought he proved that. When it comes to foreign affairs, no one on that stage was more versed and more experienced. I thought his answers about Iran, especially the Middle East, were spot on."
Gresham added that social issues, in particular, "are right in Rick's wheelhouse." Santorum spoke out strongly during the debate against abortion and same-sex marriage.
"He was the only candidate on the stage who has beaten an incumbent Democrat; not only once, but three times," Gresham continued. "And his personal approach here in Iowa… Show me another candidate who has done the legwork that Rick has done… No one has done it better than Rick has, and I think that come Saturday, it is really going to pay off for him. And that same approach that he is using here in Iowa is really resonating very strong in South Carolina, too. The states are very, very similar."
