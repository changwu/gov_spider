    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Solomon (R) New York and 248 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 2327, because it would transform beneficiary travel benefits into a new entitlement program. H.R. 2327 would also overturn recently published regulations limiting routine travel payments. These regulations were the result of several years of effort to control rapidly escalating expenditures for this travel without impairing access of veterans to needed care.
