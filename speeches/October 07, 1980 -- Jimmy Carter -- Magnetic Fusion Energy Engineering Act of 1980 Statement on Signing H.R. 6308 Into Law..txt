    I have today signed H.R. 6308, the Magnetic Fusion Energy Engineering Act of 1980, a bill authorizing a magnetic fusion research, development, and demonstration program within the Department of Energy. The bill establishes as a national goal the successful operation of a magnetic fusion demonstration plant in the United States by the year 2000. The scientific results of magnetic fusion experiments have been highly encouraging so far, and there is considerable confidence that controlled fusion reaction can be achieved. Congressman McCormack and Senators Church, Tsongas, Baker, and Domenici are to be commended for their foresight in obtaining the enactment of H.R. 6308.
Fusion power offers the potential for a limitless energy source with manageable environmental effects, and H.R. 6308 represents a bipartisan effort to develop fusion as a viable energy option for the United States. Our Nation is the undisputed leader in developing this advanced technology, and H.R. 6308 will help us keep it that way. This bill represents a reasonable approach to the broad advancement of fusion research and technology. I sign it into law with pleasure.
