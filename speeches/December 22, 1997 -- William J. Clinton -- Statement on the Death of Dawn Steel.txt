    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Dawn Steel. She was a pioneer in the film industry, blazing a trail for a new generation of young women, and setting a standard of achievement for all. Our lives have been en riched by her talent, and she will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband, her daughter, and with all her family.
