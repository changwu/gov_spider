    President Biden's economic plan is working. The Global Economic Prospects Report, released yesterday by the World Bank confirms the OECD's assessment from last week that since President Biden took office, the economic picture has improved dramatically in the U.S., and that the U.S. recovery is now outperforming that of other advanced economies.
The World Bank nearly doubled its January projections of US GDP growth from 3.5% to 6.8% -- the fastest pace since 1984 â€“ based on the strength and speed of President Biden's economic and vaccination plans. The U.S. is now expected to exceed its pre-pandemic GDP projections by the end of this year, while other regions remain below pre-pandemic expectations.
