    We applaud the House of Representatives for passing over 50 comprehensive bills in the last two weeks to combat the opioid and drug demand crisis. President Donald J. Trump and his Administration's ongoing work to tackle this important issue could not be possible without complementary legislation from our allies in Congress. These necessary bills will help save American lives through prevention and education, treatment and recovery, and law enforcement and interdiction. Ultimately, this legislation reflects and helps advance some key elements of the President's initiative to reduce the drug demand and drug supply in this Nation, and would be the most significant Congressional effort against a single drug crisis in United States history. We look forward to continuing our work with Congress on a problem that affects everyone and that should be solved by everyone. We urge the Senate to continue the bipartisan tradition of helping Americans who are affected by the crisis, to swiftly pass the legislation from the House, and to get these lifesaving bills to the President's desk. Enacting this legislation will be another step in our long but worthwhile effort to ameliorating and then ending this crisis once and for all.
