    WMUR:
"...the poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center shows that Ohio Gov. John Kasich has emerged as the strongest Republican to take on the Vermont senator in a hypothetical November battle for the state's four electoral votes.
Not only does Kasich come closer to Sanders than his GOP competitors, but the poll, conducted Feb. 20-28, also shows Kasich leading former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 10 percentage points in the Granite State."
