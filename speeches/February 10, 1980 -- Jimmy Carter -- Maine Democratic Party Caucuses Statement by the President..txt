    I am grateful to the Democrats of Maine for this welcome vote of support. I especially appreciate the hard work and dedication of the thousands of supporters and volunteers in the State whose efforts made this victory possible.
I regret that international circumstances made it impossible for me to travel to Maine during this campaign, and I look forward to the time when I am able once again to personally and directly seek the support of my fellow Democrats around the country.
Both Senator Kennedy and Governor Brown ran strong, well-organized races, and I congratulate them on their campaigns.
