    I send greetings to the Jewish community in the United States and around the world as you observe Rosh Hashanah.
As you mark the beginning of the High Holy Days, take time to reflect on the past year. In seeking forgiveness and renewal, may you again appreciate the love and mercy of the Almighty, and look to the year ahead with hope and faith. I encourage you to draw strength from the many examples of courage, sacrifice, and compassion we have witnessed during the last year.
As we face the challenges of a new era, America remains committed to freedom, justice, and opportunity for all people. During this time of examination and remembrance, I join you in looking forward to a future of tolerance and peace.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed holiday spent with family and friends.
