    I called President-elect Vicente Fox today to offer my congratulations and those of the American people on his historic victory in Mexico's national elections yesterday. I also spoke to President Zedillo to express my admiration for his extraordinary contributions to Mexico, including his efforts in working with other Mexican leaders to strengthen and deepen democracy. Mexicans should be proud of the extraordinary steps they have taken during the last 6 years to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and set Mexico on a course of economic growth and prosperity.
Mexico is our neighbor and friend. Mexico's national elections, the freest and fairest in the nation's history, stand as a vivid testimony to the depth of the democratic commitment of the Mexican people. I reiterated both to Presidentelect Fox and President Zedillo that the United States stands ready to work to enhance the close cooperation that characterizes our bilateral relationship.
