    U.S. Representative and Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Mike Rogers (R-MI) today made the following statement on the recent leaks of sensitive national security information:
"Every presidency has seen its share of leaks, but the recent disclosures may be the most dangerous in our lifetime.  Troubling disclosures of highly-classified intelligence matters have occurred far too often, including covert efforts to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.  Mitt Romney has called for a thorough, independent investigation of the White House leaking, and he's right.  An investigation outside of the Attorney General's chain of command is long overdue to ensure the facts can be taken wherever they lead, including to the highest levels of our government.  America's national security officials should never allow politics to interfere with their vital work of keeping the American people safe."
