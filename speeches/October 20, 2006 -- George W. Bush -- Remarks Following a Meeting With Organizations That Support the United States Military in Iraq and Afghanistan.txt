    I've had an uplifting and heartwarming conversation with fellow citizens of all ages from across our country who are supporting our troops. These folks don't really care about politics. What they care about is how best to send a strong message to the men and women who wear our uniform that America supports them.
And so we've had examples of people who started web pages to get different supplies to send to troops who areâ€”who need a care package; to a woman who started a group of people to sew garments to help the wounded recover faster; to a guy who helped start video conferencing capabilities so that loved ones can share big moments in their lives together, even though one is in combat; to a child who started treasure hunts to raise money to help kids go to school. It's a remarkable country when we have people who decide to step up and help men and women who are serving their country in a time of need.
And I want to thank you all for coming, and I appreciate what you're doing. Americasupportsyou.mil is a web site where our fellow citizens can volunteer to help. You can become a part of a group and find out ways that you can support our men and women in uniform. These are brave, courageous people who deserve the full support of the American citizenry.
So I want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate you being here. Thanks very much.
