    It gives me great pleasure to sign into law S. 2322, the "Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1992."
Our Nation provides compensation payments to service-disabled veterans and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits to the survivors of those who die as a result of military service to our country. My Administration is committed to ensuring that these payments keep pace with changes in the cost of living.
S. 2322 provides a 3 percent increase in compensation and DIC benefits, which is the same cost-of-living adjustment Social Security beneficiaries and veteran pensioners will receive. Nearly 2.2 million veterans and their dependents and about 313,000 surviving spouses and children will benefit from this increase, which is effective December 1, 1992.
As a Nation, we must always remember the special debt that we owe those veterans who unselfishly give of themselves to assure that the security and honor of this country are maintained. The freedom and liberty that we enjoy as citizens of this great Nation depend on the men and women of our Armed Forces. The measure that I sign today bears witness to our gratitude and continued commitment to those who serve our country. It tangibly demonstrates that the American people will not forget the valuable contribution that veterans have made to this Nation.
