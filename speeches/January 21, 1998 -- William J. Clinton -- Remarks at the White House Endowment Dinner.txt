    Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? This will be a brief program, because we want you to have a wonderful time tonight at the White House. We thank you for doing so much to support the White House Endowment Fund and for your commitment to ensuring that this house, the people's house, remains the pride of our people well into the next millennium.
No one has been more committed to making sure that this house is for all of our people than the First Lady. Over the past 5 years, Hillary has worked so hard to showcase the talent and creativity of all Americans in each of these grand and historic rooms, from refurbishing the Blue Room to securing the first painting by an African-American, or the first painting by Georgia O'Keefe for the White House's permanent collection. Her contributions to this house will remain a long time after we're gone from Washington.
Let me say it was in no small part because of her dedication that the 1.5 million visitors who walk through the White House every single year have been able to enjoy the richness and diversity of America's cultural heritage. I thank her for her leadership and for making this house on all floors a more wonderful and truly historic place to live.
And now, in reverse of the usual order, it is my pleasure and honor to introduce the First Lady of the United States.
