    WASHINGTON, May 24, 2022 – Tomorrow, May 25th, First Lady Jill Biden and the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy will greet the arrival of the second shipment of infant formula arriving at Dulles International Airport, brought to the United States under "Operation Fly Formula" in response to the infant formula supply chain challenges caused by Abbott Nutrition's voluntary recall.
President Biden launched "Operation Fly Formula" last week, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Department of Defense (DOD), to speed up the importation of infant formula and get it into stores as quickly as possible. Using DOD-contracted commercial aircraft for transportation, infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards is picked up from manufacturing facilities abroad and delivered to hospitals and retailers in the United States. The first shipment arrived on Sunday, May 22, bringing 132 pallets of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infant and Alfamino® Junior formula from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to Indianapolis, Indiana – equating to 500,000 8-ounce bottles of formula. Tomorrow's DOD-contracted flight, also from Ramstein Airbase in Germany, will be operated by FedEx Express and is delivering more than 100,000 pounds of formula, which equates to an additional 1 million 8-ounce bottles of Nestlé's Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA® infant formula. The formula will be transported by FedEx Express to a Nestlé distribution facility near Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Tomorrow's event at the FedEx Express Ramp at Dulles International Airport will be open to the press and begin at approximately 1:00 PM ET, which is subject to change, pending the flight's departure from Germany. For interested media, please RSVP HERE by 5:00 PM ET today, May 24, 2022. Additional logistical details will be provided to the media through the RSVP process.
