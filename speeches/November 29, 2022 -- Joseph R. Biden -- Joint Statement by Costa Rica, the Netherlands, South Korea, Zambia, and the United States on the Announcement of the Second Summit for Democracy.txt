    Today, we the governments of Costa Rica, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Zambia, and the United States are pleased to announce that our leaders will co-host the second Summit for Democracy on March 29-30, 2023.
Building on the first Summit for Democracy held in December 2021, this gathering will demonstrate how democracies deliver for their citizens and are best equipped to address the world's most pressing challenges.
We are living through an era defined by challenges to accountable and transparent governance. From wars of aggression to changes in climate, societal mistrust and technological transformation, it could not be clearer that all around the world, democracy needs champions at all levels. Together with other invitees to the second Summit, we look forward to taking up this call, and demonstrating how transparent, accountable governance remains the best way to deliver lasting prosperity, peace, and justice.
The second Summit for Democracy will assemble world leaders in a virtual, plenary format, followed by hybrid gatherings in each of our countries with representatives from government, civil society, and the private sector. Together, we will showcase progress made by Summit partners on commitments during the Year of Action, and will reaffirm the vitality of the democratic model and collective action to meet the unprecedented challenges of our time.
We look forward to another successful Summit, and accelerating concrete action toward democratic renewal.
