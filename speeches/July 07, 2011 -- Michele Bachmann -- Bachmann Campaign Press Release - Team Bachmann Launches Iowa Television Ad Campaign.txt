    Washington, D.C. â€” The Bachmann for President campaign announced today the launch of a new television ad entitled "Waterloo" which highlights Michele Bachmann's Iowa roots and her efforts to fight wasteful spending in Washington. The following ad will run statewide in Iowa starting Thursday, July 7, 2011.
"As a descendant of generations of Iowans, I was born and raised in Waterloo.
As a mom of five, a foster parent, and a former tax lawyer, and now a small business job creator, I know we can't keep spending money that we don't have.
That's why I fought against the wasteful bailout... against the stimulus.
I will not vote to increase the debt ceiling.
I'm Michele Bachmann and I approve this message."
