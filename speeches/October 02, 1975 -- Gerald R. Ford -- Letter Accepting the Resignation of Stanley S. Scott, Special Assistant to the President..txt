    Dear Stan :
I have received your letter of October 2, and it is with sincere gratitude for your many years of dedicated public service that I accept your resignation from the White House staff upon a date to be determined. You have served very effectively as Special Assistant to the President and before that as Assistant to the Director of Communications of the Executive Branch. I know the work has been demanding, but with your ability, candor and energy, you have made significant contributions in the important field of minority relations. I am sorry to lose you.
I fully understand your desire to accept a new assignment at the Agency for International Development. The appointment will provide you with a larger opportunity to lend your well-deserved reputation and your expertise in government to helping alleviate some of the difficult and complex problems facing Africa. The United States is committed to helping to solve those problems and your appointment reaffirms that commitment.
In departing the White House you may be sure you take with you my best wishes as well as my deep appreciation for a job well done. As you join AID I am confident that you will continue to provide the leadership needed for your important new responsibilities.
Warmest personal regards,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable Stanley S. Scott, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
