    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Panetta (D) CA and 6 others)
The administration opposes the House Education and Labor Committee version of H.R. 1340, because it would severely restrict the Department of Agriculture's administrative flexibility to operate the commodity distribution program effectively and would add unnecessary program costs.
The administration does not object to House passage of the House Agriculture Committee version of H.R. 1340, which is expected to be offered as a substitute. This version is a much more effective approach to improving the commodity distribution program and is budget neutral.
