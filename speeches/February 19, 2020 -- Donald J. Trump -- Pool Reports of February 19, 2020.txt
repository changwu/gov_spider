Onpassing from Stephanie Grisham about Daily Beast article alleging that Trump offered a pardon to Julian Assange in exchange for covering up Russia's involvement in the DNC hack:
"The President barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he's an ex-congressman. He's never spoken to him on this subject or almost any subject. It is is a complete fabrication and a total lie. This is probably another never ending hoax and total lie from the DNC."

Excerpts from President Donald J. Trump's remarks to Rural Stakeholders on California Water Accessibility (as prepared)
...I am thrilled to be here today as we take historic action on behalf of our incredible farmers, ranchers, growers, and communities throughout the Central Valley and across the great state of California....As a candidate for President, I promised to help solve the water crisis that was crippling our farmers due to chronic mismanagement and misguided policies....In 2018, I ordered my Administration to update the outdated scientific research and biological opinions that help determine water allocation here in California....Today, I am pleased to announce that this update is COMPLETE. A major obstacle to providing more water for the region's farmers has now been ELIMINATED....>From the beginning, the Trump Administration has DELIVERED for our great Farmers....Under the previous Administration, net farm income plummeted by 20 percent. Under my Administration, net farm income has increased by nearly 50 percent....We have secured historic trade deals—including a new trade agreement with China and the USMCA—that will massively increase our agricultural exports....We terminated the Waters of the United States Rule....America is a nation built by farmers who work hard to provide for their families, support their neighbors, and draw out God's abundance from the Earth. You pour out your sweat and soul for your land, your communities, and your country....--

Travel report #7a: Event is starting; background
The president just took the stage to deafening applause and "USA USA chants" at an airplane hangar in Bakersfield. Event is open press and streamed on WH YouTube.
Background from Judd Deere: Today, President Donald J. Trump will deliver remarks to highlight his Administration's support for rural America and sign a Presidential Memorandum on Developing and Delivering More Water Supplies in California.
President Trump is committed to reforming outdated regulations that have undermined many Federal western water infrastructure investments for decades.  On October 19, 2018, the President signed a Presidential Memorandum outlining water supply goals for the San Joaquin Valley and other areas in southern California as part of an event in Scottsdale, AZ.  The Presidential Memorandum also directed the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality to review long-term coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project and subsequently to issue an updated Plan of Operationsand Record of Decision (ROD).
The Presidential Memorandum to be signed as part of this event directs DOI, DOC, and CEQ to build upon the success of the Plan and ROD by supplementing these operations to help develop and deliver water supplies in the Central Valley of California.

Travel pool #8: Bakersfield > Phoenix
Event ended at 342 pm. We are departing shortly for Phoenix where POTUS is scheduled to hold a rally.
Few notes:
* POTUS said that Republicans would like to pick up seven House seats in the state of California and "get rid of Pelosi," which earned him a loud round of cheering.* POTUS told the group the border wall construction is up to 122 miles.* A local farmer thanked him for cutting regulations. Another told him: "Every day that you've been in office you've done exactly what you promised. You came to California and sought to understand our water issues."* POTUS invoked disparaging nicknames to bring up some 2020 Dems - "Mini Mike hates the farm. I don't know, I don't think he's going to be the candidate anyway. Have to start working on Crazy Bernie pretty soon."* "You're incredible people," he told the group. "You work so hard, and you're smart as hell."

Travel pool report #9: Phoenix arrival
AF1 landed in Phoenix at 6 pm on the dot. POTUS disembarked against the watercolors of a very beautiful Arizona sunset and gave a small wave.
The flight was uneventful, though Judd Deere passed the pool a paper printout of POTUS's tweet naming Richard Grinell the acting director of national intelligence.
Fox News was playing aboard and flashed several of the polls that have apparently irritated the president regarding his potential 2020 matchups, at least according to his tweet earlier today.
We are rolling to the rally at 6:21 pm.

"I assure you my father will be in the fight. And he'll make it very, very, very entertaining."
Some 40 minutes after POTUS arrived at the venue, the crowd, apparently tired of waiting for him to emerge, began chanting "We Want Donald."
