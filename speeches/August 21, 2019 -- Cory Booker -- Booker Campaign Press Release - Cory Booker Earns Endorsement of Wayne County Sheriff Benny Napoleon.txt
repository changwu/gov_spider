    Newark, NJ â€” Today, Cory Booker earned the endorsement of Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon.
Sheriff Napoleon credits Cory's comprehensive plans to take on criminal justice reform, combat gun violence, and address the rise in violence incited by white nationalism in America as reasons he is endorsing Cory.
Benny Napoleon is the Sheriff for Wayne County in Michigan, a post he has held since 2009. Napoleon started off as a police officer in 1975, and in 2004, after climbing through the ranks, was appointed Assistant Wayne County Executive.
The Detroit News: Benny Napoleon backs Cory Booker for president
Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon is backing Democrat Cory Booker for president, giving a boost to the New Jersey U.S. senator with Detroit ties six months out from Michigan's primary.
Napoleon is a high-profile African-American leader in vote-rich Detroit, which Democratic presidential candidates flooded late last month for their second series of debates. Booker, whose mother was born in the city, stuck around for a separate "Detroit Rise" event.
"I have known Cory Booker for years and continue to be personally inspired by his comprehensive plans to take on criminal justice reform, combat gun violence and address the rise in violence incited by white nationalism," Napoleon said in a statement shared by Booker's campaign.
"He understands the problems facing urban communities and communities of color, and is ready to lead with compassion and strength. I believe that the Democratic Party should nominate Cory, because he is just the candidate we need to energize voters in places like Detroit, who are essential to winning back the White House in 2020."
