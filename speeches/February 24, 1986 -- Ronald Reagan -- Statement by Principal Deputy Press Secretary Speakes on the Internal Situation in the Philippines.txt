    We have received disturbing reports of possible attack by forces loyal to General Ver against elements of Philippine forces that have come to the support of General Ramos and Minister Enrile. We urge those contemplating such action to stop.
Marcos has pledged to refrain from initiating violence, and we appeal to him and those loyal to him and all other Filipino people to continue to do so. Attempts to prolong the life of the present regime by violence are futile. A solution to this crisis can only be achieved through a peaceful transition to a new government.
