    In a phone call today with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Vice President Biden expressed his disappointment in the Ukrainian government's decision to delay preparations for signature of an Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU. As the Vice President has told President Yanukovych before, it is our strong conviction that closer integration with Europe offers Ukraine a strategic opportunity to strengthen its democracy and return its economy to prosperity. The Vice President underscored the continued support of the United States for the Ukrainian people and their aspirations for European integration.
