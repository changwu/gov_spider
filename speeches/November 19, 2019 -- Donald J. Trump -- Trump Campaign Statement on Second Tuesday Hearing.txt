    "It couldn't be more clear that Democrats are looking to impeach first and find a reason later, as these latest witnesses clearly illustrate. Tim Morrison was actually on the Ukraine phone call, testified that he had no concerns about it, and confirmed that the transcript of the call is accurate. Ambassador Kurt Volker's testimony merely rehashed information we already knew from the transcript, which everyone in the world can already read for themselves. There was no quid pro quo, no bribery, and no extortion. The Democrats' entire premise has fallen apart for the entire nation to see."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 director of communications
