Memorandum For Federal Employees and Military Personnel
The Combined Federal Campaign gives each of us the opportunity to show our individual concern for those in need. In this one campaign are combined the annual fund-raising efforts of the local United Way, the National Health Agencies, the International Service Agencies, and the American Red Cross.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign we can provide support for these voluntary organizations which are working to make our community, our nation, and the world a better place in which to live. Through CFC we can support organizations which are performing essential services to the disadvantaged and are serving the youth and the aged in our community. We can help voluntary agencies which are working to lessen the pain and distress of illness and are conducting research to seek cures from dreaded diseases. And we can assist agencies which serve beyond our own national boundaries, extending a helping hand to our friends in overseas lands. We have a unique opportunity to do all this through one gift--a gift made easier by the availability of payroll deductions.
Federal employees and military personnel have a proud tradition of generosity and concern for others. I am confident that tradition will be upheld this year. While the amount you give is a personal, voluntary decision, I hope that each of you will join me in supporting the Combined Federal Campaign to the fullest extent possible.
