    Ask Megyn Kelly:
"You can see if [Donald Trump] loses [Ohio or Florida], he is in a much more precarious position because it would require him to win at a much higher rate than we've seen him capable of doing so far."
The good news? The most recent poll shows John Kasich slightly ahead of Donald Trump in Ohio.

It's called "delegate math." Ohio and Florida are different from most other primaries in that they are "winner-take-all" states. When John Kasich wins Ohio it virtually assures Donald Trump will fail to secure the majority of delegates needed for the GOP nomination. It also propels Kasich forward to states where he will perform well, enabling him to secure a surge of both delegates and momentum as we head to the convention.
