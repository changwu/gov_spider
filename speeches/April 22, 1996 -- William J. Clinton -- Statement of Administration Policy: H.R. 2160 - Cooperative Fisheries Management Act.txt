(House)(Saxton (R) New Jersey)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2160. The bill would reauthorize the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act and the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act and enhance the ability of the Commerce Department to provide disaster assistance to fishermen.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2160 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB is developing its preliminary PAYGO estimate for the bill.
