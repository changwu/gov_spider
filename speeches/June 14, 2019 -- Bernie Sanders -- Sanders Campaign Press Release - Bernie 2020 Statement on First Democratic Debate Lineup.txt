    WASHINGTON â€“ Bernie 2020 today issued the following statement in response to the lineup announced by the DNC for the party's first presidential debate:
"This is a terrific lineup because there will be a real debate over the key set of choices in this Democratic primary," said Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir.
"This debate will also provide Senator Sanders the opportunity to highlight his leadership on a host of important issues, including Medicare For All, opposition to the Iraq war, votes against horrific trade agreements, and record of boldly taking on the fossil fuel industry and corporate greed. We look forward to hearing other candidates outline their visions for the country and plans to fully guarantee all people the right to health care, housing, education, a clean environment, and the freedom of basic economic rights."
