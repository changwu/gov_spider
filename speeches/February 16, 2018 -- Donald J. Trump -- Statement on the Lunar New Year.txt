    I send my warm greetings to those in the United States and around the world celebrating the Lunar New Year.
Our Nation has the unique privilege of a diverse and spirited Asian American population that has left its mark on the country in more ways than one. Asian Americans have made countless contributions to our national unity and makeup. It is not difficult to notice how deeply they cherish a rich heritage and emphasize the importance of sacred traditions and familial ties.
The American people join with those in Asia and around the world in welcoming the Year of the Dog. According to tradition, the dog represents qualities such as honesty, reliability, and sincerity. These are virtues that all Americans celebrate and hold dear. Indeed, they underlie the strength and prosperity of our Nation and guide our relations with our neighbors, friends, and partners. Today, and every day, we redouble our commitment to maintaining these values in all that we do.
In that spirit, Melania and I send our best wishes for a happy Lunar New Year as people come together to celebrate this special occasion with family gatherings, fireworks, festivals, and parades.
