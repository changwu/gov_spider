PAUL RYAN: "And there's one issue that I've focused on much of my time in Congress, serving with great guys like Bob Goodlatte. And that is we have got to stop spending money we just don't have. We can't keep doing this to our children and our grandchildren. We know without a shred of doubt that this country's on the wrong path. This is not even refutable. We know that for the first time in the history of this nation, this generation of adults is consigning the next generation to a diminished future. We have a moral obligation to preserve the American dream not only for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren. That's why we have to get this debt and deficit under control and balance the budget and pay off our debt so our kids have a shot at the American dream."
