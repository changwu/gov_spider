    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Owens (D) NY, Waxman (D) CA, and Madigan (R) IL)
The Administration shares the Congress' concern about the problem of infants born addicted to drugs or with AIDS who are abandoned in hospitals. The Department of Health and Human Services has already initiated a grant program, using available funds, for demonstration projects to address this problem, including foster family care and innovative community-based alternatives to hospitalization. The Administration does not object to H.R. 4843.
