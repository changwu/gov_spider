Governor Kasich's leadership was credited with bringing jobs back to America from Mexico
Today Donald Trump took credit for Ford moving jobs back to the United States from Mexico.
The truth is that Ford began moving jobs back to Ohio four years ago under the leadership of Governor John Kasich.


"Our country needs real leadership and not empty, false rhetoric. Working as a TEAM, we brought Ford production jobs back from Mexico to Ohio years ago. That's how things really get done. Hard work and teamwork brings results for the people," said Governor John Kasich. "Our nation needs a leader with a record of actually delivering for all of us, that's why I'm running for President."
When the Governor announced Ford onshoring of jobs in 2011 the Vice President of Ford North America Manufacturing said it was "enabled by the Governor and his strong leadership."
