    Today, the president-elect hosted a virtual meeting with civil rights leaders. Joined by Vice President-elect Harris and Congressman Cedric Richmond, President-elect Biden thanked the leaders for meeting with him, for their support and counsel over the years, and expressed the desire that this was the first of an ongoing relationship with his administration. They discussed their joint priorities including advancing racial equity across the board, enforcing civil rights, and assembling a diverse White House and Cabinet that represents America. They expressed the need to make sure the public knows the historic nature of many of the president-elect's diverse nominees and the need to galvanize the community around making sure that the Senate confirms them.
