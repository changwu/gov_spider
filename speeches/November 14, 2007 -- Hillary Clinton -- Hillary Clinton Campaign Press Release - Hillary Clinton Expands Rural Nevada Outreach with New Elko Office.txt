    With Hillary's support continuing to grow throughout Nevada, the Clinton campaign is expanding its Silver State presence with a new office in Elko. Located at 445 Fifth Street, the new office will expand Hillary's presence in rural northern Nevada to continue mobilizing caucus-goers in Elko County and throughout the state.
The Elko office is the fourth storefront for Clinton in Nevada, joining offices in Las Vegas, Reno and Pahrump.
"With less than 10 weeks to go before January's caucus we are continuing to grow our Nevada organization, actively moving to shore up support for Hillary in all corners of the state," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "Hillary's message of change is clearly resonating among Nevadans, evidenced by large numbers of volunteers working the phone lines, knocking on doors and attending campaign events every day. The Elko office will be another important outlet to contact voters and drive supporters to the caucus."
The Elko office is open to the public seven days a week. Individuals interested in learning more about campaign efforts in the state, Nevada's caucus and ways to get involved should call or visit the office.
