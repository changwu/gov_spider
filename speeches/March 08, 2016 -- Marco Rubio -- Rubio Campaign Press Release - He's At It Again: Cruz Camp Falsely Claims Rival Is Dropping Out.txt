Ted Cruz is at it again, with his Hawaii team pushing a debunked CNN story to try to convince voters that one of his rivals is dropping out.
Again @tedcruz caught spreading rumors and lies. A campaign built on disgusting tactics, IA all over again. pic.twitter.com/Hwjo4iMlTk

The parallels to the Cruz campaign spreading rumors about Ben Carson in Iowa are eerily similar: That was based on a CNN report too!
Team Marco's Joe Pounder added that voters in Florida should be wary of similar tactics:
Senator Cruz is up to his dirty tricks again spreading false rumors and lies. We won't allow him to do to Marco Rubio in Florida what he did to Ben Carson in Iowa. Floridians and voters across the country will reject Senator Cruz's campaign of disgusting tactics because they know a vote for Cruz is a vote for Donald Trump.

Marco is going to continue his fight in all 50 states, and no number of dirty tricks from the Cruz campaign can stop him.
