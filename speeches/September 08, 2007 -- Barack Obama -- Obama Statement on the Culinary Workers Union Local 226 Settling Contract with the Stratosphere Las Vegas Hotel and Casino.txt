    Las Vegas, NV - Barack Obama made the following statement today on the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 settling their contract with the Stratosphere Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.
"This is exciting news for the workers at the Stratosphere Las Vegas Hotel and Casino who now have fair contracts and the security of a living wage. I'm thrilled to see them working together to help their employees achieve the Las Vegas dream.
With over 10,000 workers still without contracts, I once again pledge my support to stand with the Culinary Union until every last worker receives the fair contracts they deserve and their opportunity to achieve the American dream."
