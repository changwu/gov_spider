    President Bush will welcome Salva Kiir, First Vice President of the Government of National Unity of Sudan and President of the Government of Southern Sudan, to the White House on January 5, 2009. The two leaders will discuss the status of implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which marks its fourth anniversary next week. This transformational peace agreement, which ended 22 years of devastating war, continues to face serious challenges in the lead up to national elections in 2009. President Bush and First Vice President Kiir will also discuss the situation in Darfur and our joint efforts to advance the cause of peace there.
