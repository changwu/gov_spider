    
BURLINGTON, Vt.— Despite promises to take on special interests, the Clinton campaign continues to accept millions in contributions from corporate interests for its campaign and its affiliated super PACs. The list of corporate interests include lobbyists for the National Rifle Association.
As late as this month, the Clinton campaign advertised a March 21 fundraising event hosted by Jeff Forbes, who was a long-time lobbyist for the NRA. She has also received maxed out contributions from NRA lobbyists.
"How can you claim to take on the gun lobby when the gun lobby is funding your campaign?" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "If Secretary Clinton is sincere about gun safety reform she should give back their money and ban gun lobbyists from any involvement in her campaign."
Gun lobbyists are the latest interest group that Secretary Clinton says she will take on as president – when in fact they are funding her campaign. They are in addition to Wall Street interests, pharmaceutical companies, fossil fuel interests, and lobbyists who have worked for the private prison industry.
Clinton's record on gun safety is all over the map. While running for president in 2008, she spoke against federal gun laws and attacked then-Sen. Obama for being too tough on gun safety. This came after having previously advocated more gun laws when running for U.S. Senate from New York.
