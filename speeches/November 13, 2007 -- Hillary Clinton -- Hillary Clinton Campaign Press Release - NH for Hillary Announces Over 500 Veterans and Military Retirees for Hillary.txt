    MANCHESTER, NH – Hillary continues to receive widespread and diverse support throughout the Granite State, and today the New Hampshire for Hillary campaign announced the names of 527 Veterans for Hillary.
"Hillary Clinton believes that once our soldiers have fulfilled their obligation to our country, our country must fulfill its obligation to them and to their families," said Bob Hannan, Air Force veteran and Co-Chair of Veterans for Hillary. "She has worked diligently to see that the brave men and women who serve are our nation receive the benefits they have been promised."
Hillary Clinton has a long history of fighting for our veterans. As President, she will enact a GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century that will offer service members, veterans and their families with expanded education, housing and entrepreneurial benefits. In addition, as President, Hillary will ensure that all of the 1.8 million uninsured veterans in this country has access to quality, affordable health care and will establish a pilot program on homelessness prevention for veterans. The program will provide subsidies, eviction prevention, and one-time assistance for veterans who fall behind on their rent.
"Senator Clinton has been a champion for proper treatment of our troops – while they are serving and when they return," said State Representative and Air Force Veteran Eleanor Kjellman. "As a leader on the Senate Armed Services committee, she has successfully fought to ensure the troops receive proper training and necessary supplies, such as body armor. Hillary has also worked to make certain that our veterans receive quality medical care, and that they have access to educational and employment opportunities.
When Hillary Clinton is president, she will end the war in Iraq. Her three-step plan would bring our troops home, work to bring stability to the region, and replace military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in securing Iraq's future. Hillary has also been fighting in the Senate to force the President to change course.
"I was registered as an independent for a long time and always explore every option before making a decision. After getting a chance to meet Hillary, my choice was clear," said John Cesana of Hudson, who served 27 years in the Army and the Army Reserve. "She will listen to you. She will talk to you. And she will answer you. I know that she will be a leader who stands up for our nation's troops."
The New Hampshire for Hillary campaign also released a new video featuring local Veterans for Hillary. The video can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW08j6_glkU.
"I am honored to have the support of these men and women from across the Granite State who have so honorably served on our country's behalf," said Senator Clinton. "Together we will work to finally bring an end to the war in Iraq, rebuild America's role in the world, and deliver on the promises made to the men and women who have served our country."
Following is a complete list of Granite State Veterans for Hillary.
