    Melania and I send our warmest greetings to all Jewish people on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish faith. Yom Kippur is a day of atonement, prayer, and fasting, and is the last day of the Ten Days of Repentance. Yom Kippur provides an opportunity to draw nearer to God through the practice of teshuva in accordance with the words of Leviticus: "For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord."
Melania and I pray that you are all inscribed in the Book of Life and hope this period of reflection and repentance leads to a deeper relationship with God. We send our best wishes for a meaningful Yom Kippur and a Gmar Chatima Tova.
