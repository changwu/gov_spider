    The United States and Vietnamese Governments have agreed on the dates of August 1-3, 1987, for the visit to Hanoi of General John Vessey, Special Presidential Emissary for POW-MIA and other humanitarian issues. Both sides have agreed that these discussions on humanitarian issues should not be linked to any outstanding political problem between the two countries, such as normalization of relations or the Cambodian question.
General Vessey's distinguished background and his dedication to this issue are well known. The United States looks forward to fruitful discussions with the Vietnamese on these issues through his mission. In this regard, Members of the Senate and House yesterday informed the Vice President of a joint resolution they expect to be passed soon expressing full support for General Vessey's mission and calling upon the Vietnamese to respond positively on the POW-MIA issue. The President is grateful for the strong bipartisan support of our policy on this issue.
