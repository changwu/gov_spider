    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Pelosi (D) CA and 15 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5140, the bipartisan economic growth compromise, without amendment. This legislation meets the criteria set out by the Administration that an economic growth package be large enough to make a difference, immediate in its impact, broad-based, temporary, and based on tax relief rather than government spending programs. The Administration commends the House for taking swift, decisive bipartisan action to improve the Nation's near-term economic outlook.
