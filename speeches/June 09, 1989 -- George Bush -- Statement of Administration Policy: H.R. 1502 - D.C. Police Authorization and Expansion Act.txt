    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fauntroy (D) District of Columbia)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1502 unless it is amended to delete the additional authorization of Federal appropriations for the District of Columbia for FYs 1990-1994.
The Administration strongly supports local efforts, including those on the part of the District, to strengthen enforcement of our drug laws. However, the District Government already has sufficient budgeting and taxation authority under home rule to achieve this objective.
