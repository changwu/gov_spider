    Today, State Representative Kate Campanale announced her decision to support Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president and join the Kasich for America leadership team in Massachusetts.
Campanale said, "John Kasich is a tireless leader, a strong voice and a fearless advocate on behalf of all Americans so that they can rise and reach their full potential. We need him in the White House. I am proud to endorse him today and spread his optimistic message across our great state."

Kate Campanale serves the 17th Worcester District, including the town of Leicester and the City of Worcester. She was elected in 2014 and was recently named one of the top "Women to Watch in Massachusetts Politics" by the United Independent Party.
