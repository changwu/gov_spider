    Today's retirement announcement by Michael Jordan marks a sad day for all those who love basketball and for sports fans around the world. In his many years on the court, Michael brought superhuman skill and unmatched athleticism, competitive fire, dedication, and teamwork to the all-American sport he loves. Like those other American pioneers, the Wright brothers, Michael Jordan proved that humans can indeed fly.
Beyond his uncanny ability to defy gravity or hit the crucial shot when everything depended on it, Michael showed generations of young sports fans how to be a good person while being a great champion. Although we will miss seeing him play, we know at least that his career ended exactly as it should have, with one last gamewinning basket to bring the Chicago Bulls their sixth championship.
As a daughter of Chicago, Hillary is especially sorry to see him go. We wish Michael, Juanita, and their family all the best in the future.
