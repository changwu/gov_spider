    Today, Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee Communications Director Katie Levinson issued the following statement regarding tonight's Democratic candidate debate:
"The leading Democratic candidates have had three debate opportunities to utter the name of our nation's biggest enemy but have refused. America needs a leader who can not only say the words â€˜Islamic terrorists' but can also stand up to them. Tonight, voters shouldn't be surprised if the leading Democratic candidates once again refuse to acknowledge that Islamic terrorism is at the root of the Terrorists' War on Us."
