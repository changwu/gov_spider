My dear Mr. Corsi:
Among the varied services of social agencies, one of the most important is that of promoting knowledge of the duties of citizenship among those who have come to our country from other lands. Their assumption of the duties of citizenship, as well as the enjoyment of its privileges, is highly desirable. I have been interested to learn of the Americanization work done by Haarlem House during the past thirty-four years, and I wish on the occasion of the graduating exercises of your school of citizenship on July 2nd, to extend my cordial congratulations and good wishes.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
