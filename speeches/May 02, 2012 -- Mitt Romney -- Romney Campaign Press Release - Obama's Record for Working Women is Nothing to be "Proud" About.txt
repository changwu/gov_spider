    "Last week, President Obama claimed he was 'proud' of his record on behalf of women. But women -like all Americans - have struggled in the Obama economy. After more than three years of failed economic policies, nearly a million more women are unemployed and poverty among women is at its highest rate in almost two decades. If this is a 'proud' record for the President, Americans truly can't afford another four more years of Barack Obama." -Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
