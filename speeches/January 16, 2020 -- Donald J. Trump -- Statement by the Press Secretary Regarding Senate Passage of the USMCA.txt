    Following a monumental signing of the Phase One Trade Agreement with China, President Donald J. Trump has delivered another trade win for American workers with the Senate's passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The trade agreement, which has now been approved by both chambers of Congress with unprecedented bipartisan support, 89-10 in the Senate and 385-41 in the House, will replace the job-killing, huge failure NAFTA â€“ fulfilling a core promise the President made to the American people. USMCA, which the President successfully negotiated over a year ago, rebalances trade between the three countries and will lead to significant economic and job growth in the United States.
