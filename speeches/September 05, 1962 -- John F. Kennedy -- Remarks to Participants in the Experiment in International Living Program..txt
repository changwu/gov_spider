    I WANT to express my thanks for all these generous presents and to welcome you to the White House.
How many of you are from India here? Will you hold up your hands? Fine.
Then we have two from Iran, I think. Seven from Iran.
And from Pakistan. Do you want to hold up your hands?
Then from Europe? Who do we have from Europe? From Italy?
Well, I want to express my welcome to all of you and to express strong support for this program of exchanges between the United States and between your countries. On not all occasions do our governments get along so well, but I think our people do. I know in the case of India that Prime Minister Nehru has welcomed a good many Americans who have visited on these programs, and on other occasions my fellow countrymen have been warmly greeted by the leaders of your country.
We're glad to have you here. I understand that you're spending 2 days in Washington comprehending and analyzing how the United States Government works, and I look forward to the results of your study.
Winston Churchill once said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other systems that have been tried. It is the most difficult, and I am glad you are here analyzing our experience, and I am sure it will make it possible for you to provide greater leadership in your country. So we're glad you are here. I'm sorry about the bugs, but it indicates something about the tropical nature of Washington.
Thank you.
