  A Proclamation

No job presents greater challenges, demands broader responsibilities, or promises more profound rewards than parenthood. Parents are daily caretakers and lifelong role models. They guide us and share the values and lessons that enable us to grow and flourish. Throughout our lives, we remember our parents' example, recognizing that their joys and aspirations, triumphs and disappointments, have shaped our experience and given us meaningful direction.
Our Nation has always depended on strong families, and we must continue to do all we can to help hardworking men and women shoulder the duties of parenthood. It is vital to support today's parents, to honor those who have taught us so much, and to impress upon young people the awesome responsibility of parenthood.
On this day and throughout the year, let us take time to celebrate the special, enduring bond between parents and children. Foster parents and stepparents, biological and adoptive mothers and fathersâ€”all deserve our respect and gratitude. Parents open their homes and hearts to nurture and protect us; let us offer in return our deepest appreciation for their devotion and care.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 28, 1996, as Parents' Day. I call upon the States, communities, and all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to express affectionate thanks to our Nation's parents.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-first.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
