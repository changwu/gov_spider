    Earlier today on the margins of APEC, President Obama met with President Ollanta Humala of Peru to continue their discussion, which began at the White House in July, of key issues in the U.S.-Peru bilateral relationship. President Obama noted President Humala's active efforts during his first 100 days to address poverty and inequality in Peru while sustaining the strong economic growth of the past decade based on sound market principles. The two presidents underscored their commitment to continue partnering on an agenda that prioritizes social inclusion and reiterated the importance of close coordination to address security challenges in Peru and throughout the Americas. The presidents also discussed the upcoming Summit of the Americas.
