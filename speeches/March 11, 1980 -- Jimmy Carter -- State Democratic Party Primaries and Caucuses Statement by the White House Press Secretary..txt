    The President would like for me to express his deep appreciation to the voters of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama for their very strong vote of support. It now appears that from these three States the President will have received between 85 and 90 percent of the total delegates selected. And the four other States that are yet to be heard from tonight—Oklahoma, Washington, Hawaii, and Alaska—we expect to receive a generous majority of the delegates to be selected there. We're beginning to. get some fragmentary returns from Oklahoma, and it appears that Oklahoma will be consistent with the three previous States and the majority that they've given the President.
