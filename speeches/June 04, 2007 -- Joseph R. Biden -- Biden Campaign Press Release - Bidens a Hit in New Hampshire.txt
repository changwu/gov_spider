A Passionate, Break Out Performance Beth LaMontagne, NHPols.com
[Sen. Biden] did manage to have that break out performance, speaking passionately on allowing gay men and women to serve in the military, the war in Iraq and genocide in the Darfur region of the Sudan. State Rep. Jim Ryan, D-Merrimack, and co-chair on the Biden campaign, said he felt the senator came across as passionate and decisive. His mention of Darfur, saying it was Americas moral authority to help, was the highlight of his performance.

Biden Funny, Forceful, and Knowledgeable Scott Lehigh, Boston Globe
Biden was forceful -- and funny -- about letting gays and lesbians serve openly in the military. The candidate who seemed most knowledgeable about foreign affairs, he also spoke powerfully and passionately about establishing a no-fly zone to help end genocide in Darfur.

Biden Brings Passion, Conviction and Substance To The Table Dante Scala, NHPR Guest and St. Anselm Professor
I think Biden is going to stick to his principles no matter what. Hes not in the same position as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama and I think hes going to speak out with passion and conviction and try to speak out with substance and bring that to the table and see whether that attracts voters or not.
On Darfur: For that moment, if you didnt know anything about the polls, youd think that Joe Biden was the frontrunner and everyone else was just following in his wake.
Biden experienced and passionate, its hard to beat Joe Biden on foreign policy Scott Spradling, NHPR Guest and Co-Moderator of the Democratic Presidential Debate
On Darfur: That answer, his credibility, his foreign policy experience and the passion that he brought to that answer, is exactly why Republicans are happy right now that hes not the frontrunner, because when it comes to the global war on terror and foreign policy issues, its hard to keep up with Joe Biden
