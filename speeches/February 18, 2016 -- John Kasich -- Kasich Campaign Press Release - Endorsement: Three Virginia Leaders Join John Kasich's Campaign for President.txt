    Today, three leaders from Virginia – Senator Frank Wagner, Arlington County Supervisor John Vihstadt, and Fairfax City Councilman Jeff Greenfield – announced they have joined Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign as members of the Kasich for America leadership team.
Wagner said, "At a time when there is considerable angst about the economy, we need a President who has a proven track record of turning an economy around. John Kasich has literally transformed the economy of Ohio. We need John in the White House to do for the nation what he has done in Ohio. He has proven conservative credentials and a proven track record of performance."

Frank Wagner represents the 7th District of Virginia. A resident of the Bayside area, Wagner serves as Chairman of the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee.
Vihstadt said, "Only Governor Kasich demonstrates both the temperament and executive leadership to get things done in today's fractured political environment."

John Vihstadt was elected to the Arlington County Board in 2014 and is the first non-Democrat to be elected to this seat since 1999. Vihstadt is an active member of the Arlington community and has an extensive record of protecting taxpayer dollars on local projects.
Jeff Greenfield, a small business owner and lifelong resident of Fairfax, is serving his eleventh term on the city council.
Responding to these key endorsements, John Kasich said, "Our leadership team in Virginia is expanding exponentially, and it's exciting to see the momentum grow. I am very grateful for the support of these leaders as we share our positive, commonsense message across the state."
