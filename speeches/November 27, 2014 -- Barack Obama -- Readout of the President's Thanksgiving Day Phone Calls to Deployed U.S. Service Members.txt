    The President today spoke by telephone with deployed members of the U.S. Armed Forces to offer his profound gratitude for their service. Specifically, the President convened phone calls with representatives of each of the five service branches: the Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy, and Coast Guard. The President underscored to each U.S. service member that he was expressing his appreciation on Thanksgiving Day on behalf of a grateful nation. He further noted that while they were engaged in distinct missions—from supporting the effort to stamp out Ebola on the frontlines to helping to prosecute the campaign against ISIL—their objective was singular: the safety and security of the American people.
