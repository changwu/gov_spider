    It is an inspiring thing for Nations and communities to have high objectives, to unite their energies in self-appraisal and boldly plan for the future.
The World's Fair to be held in New York beginning in 1939 is a challenge to all Americans who believe in the destiny of this Nation, and who welcome the knowledge that the exposition is to focus upon one central theme: building the world of tomorrow.
At this great fair all the world may review what the United States has achieved in the 150 years since George Washington was first inaugurated as President of the United States; here millions of citizens may visualize the national life which is to come.
That it will be a memorable and historic fair, that it will profoundly influence our national life for many years to come, and that success may attend every phase of its activitiesâ€”these are the hopes of the people of the United States. All power to you sponsors.
Hon. Grover Whalen,
New York, N.Y.
