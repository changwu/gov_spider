    Dole/Kemp Debate Negotiator Carroll Campbell released the following statement today on the Commission's decision regarding Ross Perot's participation in the presidential debates:
"The unanimous decision today by the Commission on Presidential Debates to move forward on debates without the presence of third-party candidates was the right one. In 1996, only one of two men will be elected President: Bob Dole or Bill Clinton. The inclusion of any other participant in the debates sponsored by the Commission would have violated the Commission's own standard to include only third- party candidates who have proved the3, have a 'reasonable' chance to be elected President. None of the third-party candidates in the race would make this claim.
"Now that this issue has been resolved, the Dole/Kemp campaign looks forward to negotiating on the remaining issues with the Clinton/Gore campaign. Our desire is for four presidential and two vice presidential debates, commencing September 26 in St. Louis. We hope all of the remaining issues can be resolved today so the campaign schedule can be set."
