    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights Between the United States of America and the Republic of Finland of February 13, 1934, as modified by the Protocol of December 4, 1952, signed at Washington on July 1, 1991. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to this protocol.
This protocol will establish the legal basis by which the United States may issue investor (E - 2) visas to qualified nationals of Finland. The protocol modifies the U.S.-Finland friendship, commerce, and navigation (FCN) treaty to allow for entry and sojourn of investors. This is a benefit provided in the large majority of U.S. FCN treaties. It is also a benefit already accorded to U.S. investors in Finland who are eligible for visas that offer comparable benefits to those that would be accorded nationals of Finland under E - 2 visa status.
As I reaffirmed in my December 1991 policy statement, the United States has long championed the benefits of an open investment climate, both at home and abroad. U.S. policy is to welcome market-driven foreign investment and to permit capital to flow freely to seek its highest return. Finland also provides an open investment climate. Visas for investors facilitate investment activity and thus directly support our mutual policy objectives of an open investment climate.
I recommend that the Senate consider this protocol as soon as possible and give its advice and consent to ratification of the protocol at an early date.
