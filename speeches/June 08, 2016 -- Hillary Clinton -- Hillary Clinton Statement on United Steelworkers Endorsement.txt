    Following the endorsement of the United Steelworkers and their 1.2 million active and retired members, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the United Steelworkers.
"The USW helped build America—and along the way, they have helped build the mighty American middle class.
"Steel is crucial to our economy, our manufacturing base, and our national security. As President, I will stand with the USW in the fight to protect workers' fundamental rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to stay safe on the job and retire with dignity. As a Senator from New York, I stood with steelworkers against efforts to undermine the competitiveness of American steel. And as President, I will throw the book at China and stop their illegal efforts to dump cheap steel in U.S. markets.
"And together, we will fight to make the kinds of investments that make America's economy grow for workers everywhere. We'll make the biggest investment in infrastructure since Dwight Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System, and make sure that we're buying American materials to build America's infrastructure. We'll invest in manufacturing, because we can and we will make things in America.
"Above all, I will always have workers' backs. Unions like USW will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House. Because when workers are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
