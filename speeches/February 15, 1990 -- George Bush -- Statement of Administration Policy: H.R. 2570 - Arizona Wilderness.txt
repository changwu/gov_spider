    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Udall (D) Arizona)
Although the Administration supports the concept of designating additional wilderness in Arizona, the Administration opposes H.R. 2570 because its enactment would be premature. Many of the areas that would be designated by the bill are still being studied by the Department of the Interior — as required by law — for wilderness designation. The existing review process should be completed before final wilderness designations are made.
