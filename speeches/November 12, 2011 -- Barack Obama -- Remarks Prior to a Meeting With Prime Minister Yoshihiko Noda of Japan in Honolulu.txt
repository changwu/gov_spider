    President Obama. Well, I just want to welcome Prime Minister Noda to Hawaii, to the United States, for this APEC meeting. I had the opportunity to have my first extensive discussions with the Prime Minister recently, and I have been extremely impressed already with the boldness of his vision. And we confirmed, once again, the importance for both of our countries--the alliance between the United States and Japan has been a cornerstone of our relationship, but also for security in the Asia-Pacific region for a very long time. And I'm confident that working together we can continue to build on that relationship in the areas of commerce, in the areas of security, in not only the Asia-Pacific region, but around the world.
And, Prime Minister Noda, welcome to Honolulu. I'm sure that we'll have another round of productive discussions. And I want to thank you and the people of Japan for your friendship. We continue also, by the way, to be concerned about the rebuilding process in the wake of the terrible earthquake and tsunami. And I want to assure you that the American people continue to stand beside you and ready to help in any way they can.
Prime Minister Noda. Well, this is my first visit to Honolulu after 34 years. And this very morning I went to the Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific and laid a wreath there, and I got to see the panoramic view of Honolulu. And I renewed my recognition of how beautiful and great this city is. And I would like to express my deep appreciation for hosting us in--here in Honolulu as the chair of APEC.
I'm very much encouraged by the fact that America is increasing its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, and I do believe that Japan and the United States must work closely together to establish economic goals and also establish security order in this region. And I hope that in the meeting today I can discuss with you these issues.
President Obama. Thank you, everybody.
