    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Martinez (D) CA)
The Administration supports providing employment and training services to displaced homemakers. Such services are being provided under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) and the Carl B. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.
The Administration, therefore, objects to H.R. 3069 because it is unnecessary. It would authorize a new grant program to serve displaced homemakers at $50 million for FY 1991 and "such sums as may be necessary" for each succeeding fiscal year. Displaced homemakers can be served more effectively through the JTPA's local delivery system and the Perkins Act programs.
