    The Turkish Cypriots have made an important new offer regarding the presently deserted city of Varosha on Cyprus. In a message to the Greek Cypriot community, they have agreed in effect to the creation of a U.N.-supervised interim administration for Varosha as soon as intercommunal negotiations are resumed, and they have expressed a readiness to enter into discussions immediately concerning plans for the interim administration. This is intended to facilitate the early return of 35,000 Greek Cypriot refugees to their homes and businesses in Varosha.
The President commends this new proposal as a positive and forthcoming step on the part of the Turkish Cypriots. He especially welcomes the important new element in this proposal which will permit the United Nations to supervise the administration of Vatosha. The President believes it is particularly important that no time be lost and no effort be spared in facilitating the return of thousands of refugees to their homes and in resuming meaningful negotiations under the United Nations to achieve a Cyprus settlement.
