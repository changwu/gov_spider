    Congratulations to Senator Obama and his campaign on their victory tonight. It's been a hard fought race here in Iowa for the last year and all eyes now turn to New Hampshire.
Hillary is going to continue making the case that in these serious times when America faces big challenges, it will take a leader with the strength and experience to deliver real change.
This race begins tonight and ends when Democrats throughout America have their say. Our campaign was built for a marathon and we have the resources to run a national race in the weeks ahead.
