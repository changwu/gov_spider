    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kennedy (D) MA and 7 others)
Although the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1199, it would prefer that action on this legislation be deferred. H.R. 1199 would restructure significantly the nurse pay system of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA believes such action should await the results of the work of its Nurse Pay Task Force, which expects to complete shortly a proposal for revision of the nurse pay system. In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about the provision of H.R. 1199 expanding eligibility for treatment of reproductive disabilities in the absence of a consensus on the proper role of the Government in regulating access to reproductive technology.
