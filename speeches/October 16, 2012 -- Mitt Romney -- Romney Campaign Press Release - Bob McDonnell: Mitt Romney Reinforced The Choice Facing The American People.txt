    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on tonight's second presidential debate:
"Tonight Mitt Romney won the debate and reinforced the clear choice facing the American people. Whether he was talking about jobs, taxes, debt, healthcare or foreign policy, he drew a stark contrast between his pro-growth policies, which will ensure American strength at home and abroad, and President Obama's tax-hiking, government-growing record, which has failed to turn around our economy or increase our nation's influence around the world. Americans know that we can't afford another four years like the last four years, and tonight's debate confirmed that Mitt Romney is the leader we need to deliver the change that Americans expect and deserve."
