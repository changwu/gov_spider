    I applaud the leadership demonstrated today by British Petroleum with its plan to dramatically reduce emissions contributing to global warming.
By committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2010, British Petroleum is setting a new standard in corporate responsibility. The company plans to meet its ambitious target through a cost-effective strategy that combines innovative market-based approaches with the latest in energy-efficiency technologies. British Petroleum's bold strategy is further proof that we need not choose between a healthy economy and a healthy environment.
I urge other businesses to follow British Petroleum's lead and help meet the challenge of global warming. And I again call on Congress to help speed this effort by funding my proposals for new tax incentives and research investment to spur energy efficiency and clean energy technologies.
