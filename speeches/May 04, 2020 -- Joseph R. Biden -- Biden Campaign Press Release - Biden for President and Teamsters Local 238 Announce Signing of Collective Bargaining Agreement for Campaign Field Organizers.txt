    Biden for President field organizers, represented by Teamsters Local 238, have ratified with overwhelming support a collective bargaining agreement effective May 1.
Teamsters Local 238 Secretary-Treasurer Jesse Case said the agreement reflects long overdue changes in an industry where workers have traditionally worked long hours for low pay.
"For the first time in history, the campaign staff for a presumptive nominee of a major political party will be covered under a union agreement that includes overtime pay for all hours worked after 40 in a week, 100 percent employer-paid health insurance, a six-day work week, a union grievance procedure and other protections afforded by a union contract," Case said. "We are pleased to announce that Biden for President field organizers, represented by Teamsters Local 238, have ratified a collective bargaining agreement effective May 1."
"Since the campaign launched, Vice President Biden has been clear that if his staff chose to unionize, he would be fully supportive of that effort," said Maju Varghese, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Advisor, Biden for President. "We are proud that our campaign continues to live out the values that have defined Vice President Biden's career. That is why his plan to grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class – the backbone of the American economy – demands that we strengthen public and private sector unions and help all workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. Our hardworking field organizers are no exception, and their efforts are critical to our success at the ballot box this fall."
In line with Vice President Biden's calls for a $15.00 federal minimum wage, this agreement will guarantee an hourly wage above $15.00 and overtime wages for all hours above 40 hours each week. This will result in an overall average increase of $1,900 in annual wages for field organizers, who will also get a 100% employer contribution for employee medical and vision coverage.
