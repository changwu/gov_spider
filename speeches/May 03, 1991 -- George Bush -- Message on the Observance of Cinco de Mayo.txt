    I am delighted to send warm greetings to all those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
As you recall the events of the Battle of Puebla, it is fitting that you pay tribute to the brave individuals whose tenacious love of freedom helped to secure independence for Mexico. Through your parades, festivals, dances, and speeches, you not only celebrate their victory but also ensure that every generation continues to learn about Mexico's perseverance on the long road to freedom.
Today, the United States and Mexico are determined to follow a path that will promote greater opportunity and prosperity for our two peoples.
As we celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we reaffirm our friendship and our commitment to the successful conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. By working together to remove barriers to trade and investment, we can promote growth and prosperity for our countries and throughout this hemisphere.
Barbara joins me in sending our best wishes for your celebration.
