    Vice President Cheney will be released from George Washington University Medical Center this morning. He will rest at home following a procedure to reopen a focal narrowing in the previously stented diagonal coronary artery.
The angioplasty was necessitated by a common complication of the stent procedure, not a progression of his heart disease.
Three sets of cardiac enzymes are normal indicating no damage to the heart muscle. Multiple EKGs have been unchanged.
No work restrictions have been placed on the Vice President who intends to resume his schedule later this week.
