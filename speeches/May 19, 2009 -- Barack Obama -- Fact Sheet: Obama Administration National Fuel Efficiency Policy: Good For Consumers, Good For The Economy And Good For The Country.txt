    BACKGROUND
The proposed national autos program adopts uniform federal standards to regulate both fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions while preserving the legal authorities of DOT, EPA and California. The program covers model year 2012 to model year 2016 and ultimately requires an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016. The result is a projected reduction in oil consumption of approximately 1.8 billion barrels over the life of the program and a projected total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 900 million metric tons. This groundbreaking policy is good for consumers, good for the auto industry and it helps our country by reducing pollution and promoting energy independence.
Ten car companies and the UAW have embraced the national program because it provides certainty and predictability to 2016 and includes flexibilities that will significantly reduce the cost of compliance. The program also honors President Obama's commitment to reconsider the denial of the California waiver by the Bush Administration.
Good for Consumers:
•      Consumer Savings: This will save American consumers money over the long term in increased fuel efficiency.
•      Consumer Choice: The proposed new national policy will preserve consumer choice. The new rules will not dictate the size of cars, trucks and SUVs that manufacturers can produce; rather it will require that all sizes of vehicles become more energy efficient.
•      A Cleaner Environment: New policy will produce environmental benefits that will reduce air pollution from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other conventional pollutants.
Good for the Economy:
•      Clear Rules: One national policy for all automakers, instead of three standards: a DOT standard, an EPA standard and a California standard that would apply to 13 other states.
•      Lower Costs: This national policy has the potential to lower compliance costs for automakers by avoiding a patchwork of fuel efficiency and pollution rules.
•      Flexibility: The new national policy provides the industry what any business wants: clarity, predictability and certainty concerning the rules. As importantly, it gives them flexibility on how to meet the expected outcomes and the lead time they need to innovate.
Good for the Country:
•      Energy Independence: The new policy will result in yearly 5% increases in efficiency from 2012 through 2016. The end product - - cleaner cars and reduced dependence on oil (1.8 Billion barrels of oil cumulatively, over the lifetime of the program) and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (savings equivalent to taking 177 million of today's cars off the road).
•      Effective Government: Historic collaboration between two agencies; breaking down silos and working towards a common goal and outcomes.
•      Bringing People Together: The national policy has the support of CEOs, Governors, the UAW, the environmental community and others around this first, comprehensive national policy.
