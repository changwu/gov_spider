    Dear Napoleon:
I was saddened and distressed to hear of the earthquake that has hit El Salvador. You know my thoughts are with you and your countrymen in this tragic moment. Please accept our promise to help in any way we can. I have directed all U.S. government agencies to provide assistance as appropriate. I know you are doing all you can to help your nation in this sad hour. Please remember we will do our utmost to help.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
