    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced the endorsement of Arkansas Secretary of State Mark Martin. Martin became the Secretary of State in January of 2011. Prior to becoming Secretary of State, he served three terms as a State Representative, where he fought to balance the budget and reign in government spending.
"I am proud to support Ted Cruz for President of the United States," said Martin. "It is time for this country to have a proven, courageous, and consistent conservative in the White House. This election is critical for our country and we need someone who will stand up and take the power from Washington and give it back to the American people. Ted Cruz has been on the forefront of fighting for issues important to conservatives like repealing Obamacare, reigning in Obama's lawless executive orders, defending life and religious liberty, and protecting all of our Constitutional freedoms. I am eager to help continue to coalesce conservatives around this campaign."
"Mark has been a consistent fighter in the state of Arkansas, protecting the liberties of all his constituents," said Cruz. "During his term as Secretary of State he has consistently ran a fiscally conservative state government, working to reign in out of control spending and supporting small businesses in order to grow the economy. I am thrilled to have Mark as part of our team to help bring conservatives together to win the White House in 2016."
