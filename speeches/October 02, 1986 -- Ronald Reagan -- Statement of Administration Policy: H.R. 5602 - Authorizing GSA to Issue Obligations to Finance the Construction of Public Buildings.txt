    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Shaw (R) Florida and 1 other)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5602, because it is unnecessary. Further, the bill's ambiguous language would result in a program that could not be administered effectively. Accordingly, the Administration opposes Congressional action at this time.
