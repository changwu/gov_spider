    We, the Partners of the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, support the Summit's goal of securing vulnerable nuclear material and radioactive sources around the world. The Global Partnership is a multilateral initiative to reduce the risk of WMD terrorism through cooperative capacity building on specific projects. The Global Partnership countries have contributed more than $55 million to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Nuclear Security Fund (NSF) since 2010. The IAEA created the NSF in 2002 to support IAEA's activities, including those to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism. We welcome the continuation of this crucial support as the IAEA principally relies on voluntary NSF contributions to carry out this vital mission.
The 24 Partners in the Global Partnership are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
