Marco discussed his successful effort to stop the Obamacare bailout on The Michael Medved Show today. 

The key quote:
The only way Obamacare can exist is if the American taxpayer bails out insurance companies. And we should not be bailing out insurance companies.

His full comments on the issue:
Well, I never felt there should be a bailout. So we were successful last year, I was successful at getting that bailout fund eliminated from last year's budget document. And the result is that this year the companies came for their money and there was $2 billion missing. And the reason why there was $2 billion missing from that fund was because we X'd it out. In essence, we said no we were not going to put any taxpayers' money.
As a result of that, one of the biggest companies selling Obamacare is United. They have stopped marketing their plan and are threatening to pull out of the whole program. And that will begin the steady unwinding of the exchanges, which of course leads to the unwinding of Obamacare.
And it proves our point: that Obamacare is a loser for these companies. The only way Obamacare can exist is if the American taxpayer bails out insurance companies. And we should not be bailing out insurance companies.
We are going to have a fight again this month, in December, and I hope my colleagues all once again rally around us to get the bailout fund defunded this year.
Marco's stand has earned him praise from conservatives. Just today, Fox News reported that he's getting "a surprisingly big boost" from his work to fight the bailout.
