    Today, California Congressman Harley Rouda released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"Joe Biden has spent his entire life delivering real results for American families. He's the best candidate to beat Donald Trump and the one I know can unite and heal our nation. From delivering on healthcare and taking on the NRA — Joe's record speaks for itself. What sets him apart is his compassion, his integrity and his empathy. Joe knows the kitchen table issues so many families are dealing with — including in my Congressional District. He has the wisdom, grit and experience to start tackling these challenges and so many more on day one. I'm proud to endorse him."
Rouda was elected to Congress in 2018 when he defeated 15 term incumbent Dana Rohrabacher. He represents California's 48th Congressional District.
Rouda's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California, which includes prominent leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steingberg, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congressman Tony Cárdenas, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Lou Correa, Congressman Jerry McNerney, and more than 50 others.
Biden for President has announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.
