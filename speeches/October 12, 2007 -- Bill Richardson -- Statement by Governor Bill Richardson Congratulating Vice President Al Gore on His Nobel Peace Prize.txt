    SALEM, NH-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today issued the following statement congratulating Vice President Al Gore on having been awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize and urging leadership in the fight against global warming:
"Vice President Al Gore has a remarkable record of public service. For over twenty years, he has been dedicated to fighting global warming for our nation and the world. His Nobel Prize is well-deserved.
"This prize is important, not only in recognition of Vice President Gore's extraordinary achievements, but also in acknowledgement of the importance of fighting global climate change. We must confront this threat head-on, and we must act now. Our dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security. Global warming threatens our environment, and its catastrophic effects threaten the livability of our planet. The Nobel Committee has recognized that the fight against global warming truly is about peace.
"We need bold change. I have proposed a plan that the Sierra Club calls the most aggressive of any of the Presidential candidates. I also have the experience to lead on this issue. I was Secretary of Energy, and as Governor, I have made New Mexico the Clean Energy State. President Bush may not follow the Kyoto Protocol, but my state does.
"Vice President Gore's efforts on global warming are awe-inspiring. However, solving this problem will take more than the heroic efforts of one man. It will require sacrifice from every American. It will require the resolve of the world. It also will require bold Presidential leadership. I am ready to provide it."
