    
It was a big day for Team Marco in Georgia on Monday.
Marco spoke at a packed, excited campaign event in Atlanta yesterday, and some great conservative leaders in the state announced they're endorsing him for President. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution calls the group "a youngish crew of up-and-coming Georgia lawmakers."
First up, congressman Austin Scott of Georgia's eighth congressional district, who had this to say about his endorsement of Marco:
Marco Rubio is the candidate who is ready to be Commander in Chief the first day in office. He will provide the type of strong conservative leadership in national security that is important to the state of Georgia and vital to our country as a whole. He has a bold vision for uniting the nation, and has the optimism and strength of character to move our economy and country forward.

In addition, Marco's been endorsed by a state senator and five state representatives:

State Senator P.K. Martin (Lawrenceville)
State Representative Buzz Brockway (Lawrenceville)
State Representative Geoff Duncan (Cumming)
State Representative Chuck Efstration (Dacula)
State Representative Trey Kelley (Cedartown)
State Representative Bert Reeves (Marietta)

More from the AJC:
"There is no candidate that I trust more to keep our country safe in the 21st Century than Marco, and I am proud to be part of his Georgia leadership team," said Duncan, R-Cumming.
Martin, of Lawrenceville, said Rubio's performance in Wednesday's debate "proved once again that he's ready to lead us into a New American Century."

We were pleased with Marco's campaign swing, too. Local station Fox 5:

We're excited by these additions to our Georgia team and the reception we got yesterday. The state's primary is March 8, and Marco looks forward to making the case for his candidacy and a New American Century all across the South.
