    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of EnergySubject: Proposed Amendment to the US-UK Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes
I have reviewed your joint letter to me of November 2, 1979, recommending approval of a proposed Amendment to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes. I note from your joint recommendation that the United Kingdom is participating with the United States pursuant to an international agreement by substantial and material contributions to the mutual defense and security. The proposed Amendment will permit cooperation which will further improve our mutual defense posture and be in support of NATO.
I hereby:• approve the program outlined in the proposed Amendment to the 1958Agreement;• determine that cooperation under the proposed Amendment will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security; and• authorize the execution of the proposed Amendment for the Government of the United States in a manner specified by the Secretary of State.
