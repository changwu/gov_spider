    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Iceland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and accompanying Protocol, signed on October 23, 2007, at Washington, D.C. (the "proposed Treaty"). The proposed Treaty would replace the existing income tax Convention with Iceland that was concluded in 1975 (the "existing Treaty"). Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the proposed Treaty.
The proposed Treaty contains a comprehensive provision designed to prevent so-called treaty shopping. The existing Treaty contains no such protections, resulting in substantial abuse of the existing Treaty's provisions by third-country investors. The proposed Treaty also reflects changes to U.S. and Icelandic law and tax treaty policy since 1975.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
