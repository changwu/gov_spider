My dear Senator Clark:
I regret deeply that the condition of your health has been such of late as to give anxiety to your friends, and seems to preclude the strain which would ensue from important negotiations which are likely to be designated to the International Joint Commission.
Furthermore, none of the section east of the Mississippi River, which comprises a large part of our boundary relations with Canada, is now represented on the Commission. These areas are pressing strongly that they should be represented, especially in view of the character of problems that are now likely to arise.
Under these dual circumstances I feel it would be desirable to make a change in the Commission in the matter of the position held by you and I should be glad to know if this would meet with your convenience.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Clarence D. Clark, International Joint Commission, Washington, D.C.]
