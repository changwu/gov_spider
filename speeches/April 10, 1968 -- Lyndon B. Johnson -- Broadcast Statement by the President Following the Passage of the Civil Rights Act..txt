    TODAY, the Nation's Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968.
This is a victory for every American because the only true path to progress for a free people is the one we will take when this legislation is made the law of the land.
Through the process of law, we shall strike for all time the shackles of an old injustice.
A few years ago when we met here in the White House and discussed open housing and how to handle it by regulation or statute, there were very few who thought that in our time we could bring this justice to all Americans. But the Congress today has shown that if we have the will, there is a way.
Therefore, I call upon the Congress again now to complete its work of hope for millions of Americans by passing the measures recommended in more than 20 messages I have sent to the Congress and in some 15 appropriations bills in order that we can move forward with our program of social justice and progress.
Now we look to the Congress for action-not just on this civil rights bill--but on the many other measures pending before it.
