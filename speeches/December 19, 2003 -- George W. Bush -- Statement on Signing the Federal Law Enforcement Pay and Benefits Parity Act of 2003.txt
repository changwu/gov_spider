    Today, I have signed into law S. 1683, the "Federal Law Enforcement Pay and Benefits Parity Act of 2003." The Act provides for a report on the pay and benefits of Federal law enforcement officers and for a program of law enforcement officer exchanges between the Federal Government and States or localities.
To the extent that section 2(b)(2) of the Act calls for submission by the executive branch of legislative recommendations, the executive branch shall implement the provision in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to submit for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient.
