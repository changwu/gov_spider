Paul T. Williams, Jr. today announced his endorsement and enthusiastic support for Senator Hillary Clinton's candidacy for President of the United States. Williams will chair the urban agenda working group for the campaign.
"Hillary Clinton has demonstrated outstanding leadership abilities," said Williams, former president of the New York Chapter of 100 Black Men and co-founder of the Eagle Academy for Young Men. "She has a record of years of commitment to issues I care about and I have learned over time that we share the philosophy that people really count! She understands that many of the problems we face can be solved by supporting people of good will, who are trying to make a difference in society," he added.
"I am honored to receive the endorsement of my friend Paul Williams," said Clinton. "I worked with Paul when he served as president of the New York Chapter of 100 Black Men and worked with them to establish the Eagle Academy for Young Men in the South Bronx," she added. The Eagle Academy, a high school for minority men whose principles are built on a set of mentoring relationships between students and successful minority men, is being replicated across the nation.
Williams is president of Toussaint Capital Partners LLC, a minority owned investment bank on Wall Street. An attorney by background, he is also working on a development project which has plans for an innovative hotel/residential development in Harlem, NY.
"Through the urban agenda working group, I hope not only to identify great initiatives to replicate regionally or nationally, such as the Eagle Academy, but to also stimulate creative approaches to support these initiatives financially," Williams said.
