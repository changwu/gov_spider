    Wapello, IA (December 15, 2007) - Yesterday Attorney General Michael Mukasey "rejected lawmakers' demands for information", thus blocking bipartisan inquiries into the CIA interrogation tapes scandal. [CNN, Washington Post, 12/15/07] The Bush administration also rebuffed calls for the appointment of a Special Counsel to conduct an independent investigation free of political interference.
Sen. Joe Biden issued the following statement:
"Yesterday's action by the Department of Justice calling on the House Intelligence Committee to delay its investigation highlights the need for a Special Counsel to immediately take over the investigation into the destruction of taped interrogations by the CIA. The American people deserve a thorough, unbiased investigation, free of any political influence. The investigation should be conducted by someone who had no involvement in the conduct under investigation."
"The continuing saga of cover-up and delay by this administration must be stopped before more documents are lost to future investigators."
