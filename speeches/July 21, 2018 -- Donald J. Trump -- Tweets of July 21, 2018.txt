Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!Retweets: 40787Favorites: 179931

The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for Obama W.H.) seems intent on damaging the Republican Party's chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the '16 Election never ends!Retweets: 23415Favorites: 91436

No Collusion No Obstruction - but that doesn't matter because the 13 Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!Retweets: 28590Favorites: 101514
