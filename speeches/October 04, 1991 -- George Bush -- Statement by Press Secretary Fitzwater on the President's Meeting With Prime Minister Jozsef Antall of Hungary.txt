    The President met with Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall in the Oval Office this morning. The President reaffirmed our strong commitment to the Hungarian economic and political transformation. The President believes that the revolutionary changes in the Soviet Union make the success of Hungarian democracy even more important than before.
Prime Minister Antall described his great concerns about the situation in Yugoslavia and urged strong international efforts to bring about a solution while providing clear safeguards for the rights of national minorities in the region. The President agreed, mentioned Secretary Baker's strong statement on Yugoslavia at the U.N. last week, and pledged to continue U.S. support for European Community-led efforts to bring about a cease-fire and a process of negotiations.
