    The United States welcomes the announcement today in Paris of the Statement of Interdiction Principles for the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The eleven nations currently participating in this initiative, which President Bush announced in Krakow on May 31, 2003, have made significant strides in shaping a new environment to combat trafficking to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and related materials. The commitment of the countries currently participating -- Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States -- emphasizes the need for proactive measures to combat the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The PSI principles are fully consistent with national legal authorities, and with relevant international law and frameworks.
The PSI is a broad international partnership of countries which, using their own laws and resources, will coordinate their actions to halt shipments of dangerous technologies to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern -- at sea, in the air, and on land. The PSI will reinforce, not replace, other nonproliferation mechanisms. Cooperative and coordinated efforts by participating countries will give strength and substance to the broad political consensus against proliferation and help address an increasingly important challenge to international security. The United States is encouraged that all participants have agreed in Paris to abide by these Principles. We support the expansion of PSI to all responsible nations willing to accept the Principles, and will seek the involvement in PSI of such countries.
