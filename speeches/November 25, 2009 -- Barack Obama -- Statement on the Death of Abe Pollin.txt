    Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Abe Pollin, a giant in the world of professional sports and someone I was proud to call a friend.
Abe was a man who knew that being an owner wasn't just about winning championships, although his teams had plenty of success. It was about helping young athletes become good people as well as good players. And it was about being part of a community. Abe believed in Washington, DC, when many others didn't, putting his own fortune on the line to help revitalize the city he loved. He was committed to the teams he guided, generous to those who needed it most, and as loyal to the people of DC as they were to him.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Irene, his sons Robert and James, and the entire Pollin family.
