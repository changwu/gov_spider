"Her husband had put up a Christie sign in their yard previously. But after hearing Kasich talk earlier this week, he went out and got a Kasich sign. It went up over the old one."

HUDSON: John Kasich has a dilemma.
Are voters focused on the future or the past? Some arguably flashier candidates — Donald Trump, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — generally talk about what they plan to do as President, not the details of their political or business records.
The Ohio governor lays out plans for the future. But he also spends a lot of time discussing his work in Congress and the statehouse, hoping Granite Staters will be impressed by his accomplishments and trust him to repeat them in the White House.
That approach was on display Thursday night at a town hall at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post here, where Kasich seemed to be enjoying himself even as he drilled into specifics of tackling the national debt and balancing budgets.
"I've been able to get a lot done," he told the crowd of more than 100.

Afterward, multiple people in the crowd said they had been impressed, though some were still deciding between two or three candidates — Kasich and Trump, one said, or perhaps Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, said another.
But George Farrington of Nashua was already sold on Kasich. "He seems to have a very sound grasp of real, important issues," he said. The GOP, he said, "can't seem to shake those clowns at the top and get down to serious candidates."
Zoe Fimbel of Mont Vernon was enthused. "His passion for leadership is a great attribute," she said. "He seems to be a very caring, moral person."
