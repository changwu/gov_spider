    Pope John Paul II, a man of peace and goodness—an inspiration to the world—has been struck today by a would-be assassin's bullet. The world is horrified, and all of us grieve over this terrible act of violence.
Pope John Paul II was wounded today while doing what he had done so well and so often throughout his travels—reaching out to others, offering hope, light, and the peace of God.
We are grateful that he has been spared. We pray that all of us will heed Pope John Paul's call for a "world of love, not of hate;" that we will hear his words reminding us that all men are brothers, that they must forever forsake the ways of violence and live together in peace.
The people of the United States, whose unbounded affection for Pope John Paul II was shown in our city streets a year and a half ago, join millions throughout the world in fervent prayer for his full and rapid recovery.
