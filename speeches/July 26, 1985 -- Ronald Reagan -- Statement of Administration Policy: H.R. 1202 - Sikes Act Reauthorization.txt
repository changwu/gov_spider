    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Breaux (D) Louisiana)
The Administration has no objection to House enactment of H.R. 1202, but will seek changes in the Senate to delete two objectionable amendments to the Act that would:
— preclude the application of 0MB Circular A-76's rules on productivity reviews to determine the most economical way to obtain services required by the cooperative plans for natural resource conservation activities on military reservations; and
— increase the amount of Defense Department timber sales receipts that are earmarked for such conservation activities from 50 percent to 100 percent.
