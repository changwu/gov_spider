LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable 6,200-plus voters to the first of three town hall meetings he is holding in California this week, continuing his pattern of attracting large crowds of voters eager to hear his platform of constitutionally-limited government and restoring economic and civil liberties.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas' town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. PST at California State University, Chico's Bell Memorial Student Union — Trinity Commons, located at 548 West Second Street, Chico, CA 95928.
In addition to speaking to the university and greater community about returning the Republican Party to its limited-government roots, Dr. Paul outlined elements of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' a fiscal and policy roadmap that curtails the federal spending, national debt, and outsize growth of government that all threaten America's prosperity.
Tomorrow and Thursday evening, respectively, Ron Paul is holding similar events at UCLA and UC — Berkeley. A picture of Dr. Paul's Cal State — Chico college campus town hall meeting follows.
