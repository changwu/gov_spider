    To the Congress of the United States:
On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that Bulgaria is in full compliance with emigration criteria of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to, and Section 409 of, the Trade Act of 1974. This determination allowed for the continuation of most favored nation (MFN) status for Bulgaria without the requirement of an annual waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated formal Report to Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Bulgaria. You will find that the report indicates continued Bulgarian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the areas of emigration and human rights policy.
The Administration intends to propose legislation, which would let me terminate the application of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Bulgaria.
