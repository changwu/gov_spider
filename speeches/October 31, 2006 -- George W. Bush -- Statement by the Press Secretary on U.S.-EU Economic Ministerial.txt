    U.S.-EU Economic Ministerial
On November 9, 2006, the second U.S.-EU Economic Ministerial will be held at the White House. The Ministerial is a demonstration of the commitment to enhancing cooperation in our dynamic economic relationship and pursuing practical measures to increase integration and promote growth.
The Ministerial will involve key members of the President's Cabinet, including Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez and Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman. Secretary Gutierrez and Secretary Bodman will be joined by other officials from key economic agencies such as the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury, as well as the Office of the United States Trade Representative. These U.S. Government officials will meet with their European Union counterparts to discuss opportunities to advance transatlantic cooperation by promoting economic growth, encouraging innovation and investment, reducing trade barriers, enhancing energy security, as well as opportunities to advance transatlantic economic integration.
The Ministerial will provide an opportunity to review progress made on key transatlantic economic issues and follow-up on our framework for continued cooperation as we prepare for the 2007 U.S.-EU Summit.
