Pool Report #4 | Note on Haiti
"From a White House Official:
At the direction of President Biden, the United States Government continues to rapidly mobilize to assist the Government of Haiti and the Haitian people after Saturday's devastating earthquake.
During this morning's Pentagon briefing, Maj. General Taylor briefed that:

Three CH-47 Chinooks and five UH-60 Black Hawks from SOUTHCOM's JTF-Bravo were deployed yesterday and have already started moving disaster relief personnel and supplies.
A CH-47 completed about 60% of a move of a Field Hospital to Les Cayes and the rest of that field hospital will be airlifted today.
The USS Arlington is now underway and expected to arrive later this week to provide additional lift and medical capabilities, and serve as another resource for the people of Haiti.
Special Tactics Airmen assigned to the 24th Special Operations Wing are currently augmenting the lifesaving and humanitarian aid efforts in Haiti and are conducting various airfield surveys to bring in humanitarian aid via airlift."
