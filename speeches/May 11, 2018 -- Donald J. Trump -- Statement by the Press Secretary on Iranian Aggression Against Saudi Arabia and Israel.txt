    Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pours resources into exporting destabilizing influence throughout the Middle East, even as the Iranian people are victims of a struggling economy. Already this week, the IRGC has fired rockets at Israeli citizens, and Iran's proxies in Yemen have launched a ballistic missile at Riyadh. These actions are further proof that the Iranian regime's reckless actions pose a severe threat to regional peace and security. It is time for responsible nations to bring pressure on Iran to change this dangerous behavior.
