    The economy has created an average of 540,000 jobs per month over the last four months – a faster rate than any President in history – and today new unemployment claims data shows the sixth consecutive week with a new pandemic low. With today's numbers, the four-week average of new unemployment claims has been cut in half since President Biden took office.
This comes on the heels of two highly respected economic forecasts –the World Bank and OECD – in recent days both revised up their 2021 growth forecasts for the U.S. to 6.8% and 6.9% respectively. That's around double their projection from before President Biden took office, and it would be the fastest rate of growth in almost 40 years.

President Biden's economic plan is working.
