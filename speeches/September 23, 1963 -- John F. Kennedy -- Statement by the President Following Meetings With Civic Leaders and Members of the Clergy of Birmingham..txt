    TODAY I met with two groups from the City of Birmingham--one a group selected by Mayor Boutwell who were representative of the city administration and the business community, and the other a group of clergymen who are representative of the major faiths.
All of the persons at these meetings expressed a desire to meet Birmingham's problems within the city itself, and to make progress to restore the confidence of the citizens of Birmingham, both Negroes and white, in its ability to keep the peace and to make progress on the problems which confront that troubled city.
Both groups also expressed hope that General Royall and Colonel Blaik will be able to contribute to easing the situation and stated that these representatives would be welcome to the city, as did the group of Negro leaders last week.
General Royall and Colonel Blaik intend to proceed to Birmingham tomorrow. Their mission is to be of whatever assistance they can in restoring good communications between the white and Negro communities in that city and in easing the racial tensions which now exist. We have now had expression from all the major elements in the city that this committee will be welcome and I ask everyone to cooperate with them.
All the groups have expressed confidence that these matters can be settled on a local level. That is also my strong belief. I am hopeful that all groups will work vigorously to that end in the coming days.
