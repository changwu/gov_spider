    The White House today announced the membership of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status. The Task Force seeks to implement the policy set forth in Executive Order 13183, which is to consider and clarify options for the Commonwealth's future status that are not incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of the United States, toward the end of enabling Puerto Ricans to determine their preference among those options.
