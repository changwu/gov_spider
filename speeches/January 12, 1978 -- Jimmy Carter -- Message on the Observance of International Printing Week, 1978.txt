    So crucial is the freedom of the printed word to a democracy that its protection is incorporated into the First Amendment to our Constitution.
The theme of International Printing Week, 1978, "Don't Stop the Presses! Let Freedom Roll," clearly expresses that printing, while it may be a business, is also a cornerstone of democracy.
A vast majority of the graphics arts firms in this nation are not massive corporations, but small, often family owned and operated businessesâ€”true examples of the private enterprise system.
I encourage the printing industry to continue its contribution to the progress of freedom.
