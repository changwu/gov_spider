    Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Dorothy Height, the godmother of the civil rights movement and a hero to so many Americans. Ever since she was denied entrance to college because the incoming class had already met its quota of two African American women, Dr. Height devoted her life to those struggling for equality. She led the National Council of Negro Women for 40 years and served as the only woman at the highest level of the civil rights movement, witnessing every march and milestone along the way. And even in the final weeks of her life, a time when anyone else would have enjoyed their well-earned rest, Dr. Height continued her fight to make our Nation a more open and inclusive place for people of every race, gender, background, and faith.
Michelle and I offer our condolences to all those who knew and loved Dr. Height and all those whose lives she touched.
