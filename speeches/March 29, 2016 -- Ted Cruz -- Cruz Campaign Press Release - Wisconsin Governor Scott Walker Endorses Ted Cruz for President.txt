HOUSTON, TexasÂ - The Cruz for President campaign announced today the endorsement of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Gov. Walker made the announcement on the Charlie Sykes radio show in Wisconsin this morning.


"After eight years of the failed Obama-Clinton Administration, Americans are looking for real leadership and a new direction," said Gov. Walker. "Ted Cruz is a principled constitutional conservative who understands that power belongs to the states - and to the people - and not bureaucrats in Washington. Just like we did in Wisconsin, Ted Cruz is not afraid to challenge the status quo and to stand up against the big government special interests. He is the best-positioned candidate to both win the Republican nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton. That's why I endorse Ted Cruz for President of the United States."
"Governor Walker has been an outstanding leader in the conservative movement and I'm honored to have his endorsement," Cruz said. "Gov. Walker courageously stood up to special interests and won in a bitter fight in Wisconsin. His leadership has made a profound impact on the people of Wisconsin and I welcome his advice on how we can unite the Republican Party and defeat Hillary Clinton in November."
