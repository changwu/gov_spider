    Christina Martin, Deputy Press Secretary for Dole/Kemp '96, released the following statement today:
"There is no deed dirtier, no low lower, no desperation deeper than the senior citizen-terrorizing tactics being used by Bill Clinton. The fact is that only Bob Dole and the Republicans have taken the Medicare trustees' most recent report which projected bankruptcy five years from now seriously. It is Bob Dole who put together an economic plan which cuts taxes, preserves Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in addition to repealing Bill Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Social Security recipients. There is only one man running who cares enough about America's senior citizens to tell the truth and that is Bob Dole.
