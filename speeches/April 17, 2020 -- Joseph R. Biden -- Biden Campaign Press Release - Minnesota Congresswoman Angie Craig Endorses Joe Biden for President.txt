    Today, Minnesota Congresswoman Angie Craig released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President:
"Our country is facing unprecedented times. Now more than ever, we need a leader who understands that every Minnesotan and American is worth fighting for.
"Joe's always stood up for the little guy – that's why he will help our small businesses recover, grow and create good-paying jobs for the future. He'll ensure that health care is accessible and affordable. He'll work tirelessly to reinvigorate our farm economy and negotiate trade agreements that open markets for farmers – not limit them.
"With Joe, working families will have a true advocate in the White House. I look forward to working arm-in-arm with him to win Minnesota this November."
In Minnesota, Biden for President has announced support from more than 35 key community leaders, local and statewide elected officials, and advocates – including Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Tina Smith, and Congressman Collin Peterson.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
