    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Supplementary Treaty to the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany Concerning Extradition signed at Washington on October 21, 1986. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Supplementary Treaty.
The Supplementary Treaty adds to and amends the Treaty Between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany Concerning Extradition, signed at Bonn on June 20, 1978. It represents an important step in improving law enforcement cooperation and combatting terrorism by excluding from the scope of the political offense exception serious offenses typically committed by terrorists, e.g., murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, use of a destructive device capable of endangering life or causing grievous bodily harm, and attempt or conspiracy to commit the foregoing offenses.
The Supplementary Treaty also will help to improve implementation of the current Extradition Treaty in several other respects.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Supplementary Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
RONALD REAGAN
