    Presidential Determination No. 94-5
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is important to the national interest that up to $ 20,000,000 be made available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of certain refugees, conflict victims, and displaced persons in Africa. These funds are to be contributed to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under this authority and to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, December 3, 1993.

Justification for Presidential Determination Authorizing the Use of $ 20,000,000 From the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund
Under section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), the President may authorize the furnishing of assistance from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (the Fund) to meet "unexpected urgent refugee and migration" needs whenever he determines it is "important to the national interest" to do so. A drawdown from the Fund of up to $20,000,000 is required to respond to unexpected urgent needs of certain African refugees, conflict victims and displaced persons. This drawdown furthers the U.S. national interest by providing humanitarian support and reducing the potential for further conflict.
Burundi Refugees $5,000,000
The unsuccessful coup d'etat in Burundi in late October sparked renewed ethnic violence between the majority Hutu tribe and the minority Tutsis. Over 675,000 refugees have fled Burundi for safety in Rwanda, Tanzania and Zaire, bringing the total number of Burundi refugees to nearly one million. The new refugees are in dire need of food, medicine, shelter and other assistance. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued an initial appeal for $17,000,000, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has issued an appeal for $3,200,000. These urgent needs could not be foreseen when the FY 1994 budget was prepared. A drawdown of $5,000,000 is proposed to respond to the UNHCR and IFRC appeals.
Sierra Leonean Refugees and Liberian Displaced Persons $2,500,000
The signing of the most recent Liberian peace accord has facilitated the extension of relief operations to conflict areas in Liberia previously inaccessible for security reasons, revealing large populations utterly destitute and on the brink of famine. In Lofa County, Liberia, 175,000 Sierra Leonean refugees and displaced Liberians suffer widespread malnutrition and illness. UNHCR has just issued a special appeal for $9,500,000 to bring urgent assistance to these victims. These urgent needs could not be foreseen when the FY 1994 budget was prepared. A drawdown of $2,500,000 is proposed to respond to this appeal.
International Committee of the Red Cross Emergency Appeal for Africa $12,500,000
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides vital services to conflict victims in Africa. In addition to its ongoing relief operations, for which the U.S. government has provided funding, new crises and needs in Africa this year have required ICRC responses in Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Zaire and Chad. In 1993, the ICRC's emergency needs have exceeded expectations. To date, the ICRC has identified additional funding required for African emergencies in the amount of $54,000,000 and is expected to need further resources for its Burundi and Angolan programs. These additional urgent needs could not be foreseen when the FY 1994 budget was prepared. A drawdown of $12,500,000 is proposed to respond to increased ICRC needs in Africa.
