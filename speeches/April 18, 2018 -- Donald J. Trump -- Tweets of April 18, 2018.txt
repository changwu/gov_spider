Pastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!Retweets: 20638Favorites: 84836

While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don't like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn't work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.Retweets: 18159Favorites: 78191

There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested & breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security & Safety NOW!Retweets: 29045Favorites: 115384

Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea!Retweets: 25827Favorites: 101034
