    I am pleased that the bald eagle—our Nation's symbol for more than 225 years and an image of inspiration and freedom to all Americans—is now being removed from the list of endangered species.
Forty years ago, only 400 nesting pairs were living. Today, nearly 10,000 nesting pairs are thriving in the lower 48 States. This number is more than triple the recovery goal set in the Endangered Species Act.
The overwhelming success of bald eagle recovery was made possible by a strong partnership between Federal and State governments and private landowners. The eagle will continue to flourish under Federal protection through the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.
This great conservation achievement means more and more Americans across the Nation will enjoy the thrill of seeing bald eagles soar. What a wonderful way to celebrate this Fourth of July.
