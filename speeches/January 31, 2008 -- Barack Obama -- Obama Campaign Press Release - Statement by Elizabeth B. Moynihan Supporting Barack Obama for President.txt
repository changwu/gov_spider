    Statement by Elizabeth B. Moynihan Supporting Barack Obama for President
In her op-ed piece in the New York Times Sunday, January 27 stating her reasons for supporting Barack Obama, Caroline Kennedy was eloquent when she said, "I want a president who understands that his responsibility is to articulate a vision and encourage others to achieve it, who holds himself, and those around him, to the highest ethical standards; who appeals to the hopes of those who still believe in the American Dream and those around the world who still believe in the American ideal; and who can lift our spirits, and make us believe again that our country needs every one of us to get involved." This describes so clearly the ideal we should all seek in a President. It is what America needs now.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, my husband of forty-eight years when he died in 2003, served as United States Senator from New York for twenty four years. Pat loved the Senate and would be surprised by this election when so many close Senate friends he respected were competing for the nomination, as is Hillary Clinton, who succeeded him and has become a very good Senator. I know he would have become excited, as I have, to see Barack Obama rekindle hope in our young as he encourages them to participate in the political process. I know Pat would approve, applaud and encourage me to join Caroline Kennedy in supporting Barack Obama's candidacy for the democratic nomination for President of the United States.
It is a rare gift to be able to inspire people to share a vision that requires commitment and dedication. The hope that John Kennedy characterized for Americans spread across the world, then faded with his death. I believe Barack Obama, like John Kennedy, has the gift to transcend obstacles and to inspire Americans to bring out the best in themselves. I firmly believe the election of Barack Obama would help restore hope and America's image in the world.
