    Vice President Kamala Harris met today with actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to express her support for the brave women and girls leading peaceful protests in Iran to secure equal rights and basic human dignity. The Vice President emphasized how the courage of these women protestors has inspired her as it has inspired the world. The Vice President commended those in Iran and in the Iranian diaspora who are giving a voice to the aspirations of a new generation seeking fundamental rights that Iran's regime has for decades attempted to deny and suppress through repression and violence. The Vice President underscored that the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand with these Iranian women and citizens. They discussed how the United States will make sure these important voices are heard, including by making it easier for Iranians to access the Internet, and that Iranian officials are held accountable for their brutality and abuses.
