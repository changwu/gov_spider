    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, the Cruz for President campaign launched a new television ad, "Pence for Cruz," that will air statewide in Indiana. The ad features Governor Pence commending Cruz for his career fighting for the Reagan agenda, opposing Washington's out of control spending, and leading on Obamacare repeal.


Pence for Cruz
TV :30
PENCE: This is a time for choosing. All of America is looking to Indiana to make a choice. I'm a Reagan conservative. I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative who's dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda. I really admire the way Ted Cruz has been willing to stand up for taxpayers in opposing runaway spending, deficits, and debt and calling for and leading on repealing Obamacare. I will be voting for Ted Cruz.
CRUZ: I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
