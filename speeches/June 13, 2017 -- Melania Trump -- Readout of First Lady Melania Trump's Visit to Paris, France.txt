    After arriving in Paris, First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Necker Hospital to visit with patients and staff. After the hospital visit, the First Lady continued to the United States Ambassador's residence to give remarks and introduce her husband during a meet-and-greet with military troops, embassy employees, and their families. The First Lady and the President then participated in an arrival ceremony with President and Mrs. Macron, followed by a tour of Les Invalides. After the tour, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Brigitte Macron visited the historic Notre Dame Cathedral and enjoyed a river cruise on the Seine that included views of Notre Dame, the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Les Invalides, the Eiffel Tower, and the French Statue of Liberty. Mrs. Trump concluded her day by joining her husband for dinner with President and Mrs. Macron at Le Jules Verne Restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.
"France is a beautiful country that is rich in history and culture," said First Lady Melania Trump. "I am grateful to President and Mrs. Macron for their gracious invitation and hospitality as we celebrate Bastille Day with them, which is not only a celebration of France's national day, but on this occasion, in 2017, also honors the historic cooperation between France and the United States during the First World War." The First Lady continued, "I also want to take a moment to thank the employees and families of the United States Embassy for all of their hard work on behalf of our country, and to extend my warmest wishes to the patients and staff at Necker Hospital. My visit with the patients was very special, and I will continue to keep them all in my thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery."
Tomorrow, Friday, July 14th, the President and Mrs. Trump will participate in a viewing of the National Day Parade in honor of Bastille Day with President and Mrs. Macron.
