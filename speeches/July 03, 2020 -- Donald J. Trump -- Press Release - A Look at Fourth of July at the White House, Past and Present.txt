    Since the founding of our Nation, Americans have cherished our liberty and honored those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend it. As we commemorate the Declaration of Independence this Fourth of July, we remember all those who have upheld freedom over tyranny for our country.
On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. President Thomas Jefferson held the first Fourth of July event at the White House in 1801, and modern Presidents have continued the tradition.
This year, at the second annual "Salute to America," President Trump will deliver remarks from the South Lawn of the White House.
Joining President Trump and the First Lady will be members of our military, first responders, doctors, nurses, and other American heroes who fought the Coronavirus pandemic on the front lines.
Festivities will honor our service members and veterans with music, military demonstrations, and flyoversâ€”as well as a spectacular fireworks display!
