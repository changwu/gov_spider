    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that nearly 200 firefighters and members of the first responder community from across South Carolina are officially supporting the presidential campaign of Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a part of the South Carolina Firefighters for Rudy coalition. The coalition was originally announced in March following a town hall Mayor Giuliani held with first responders in Spartanburg and has since grown from 93 to nearly 200 today.
Chaired by Lewis Hayes, Chief of the Croft Fire Department, South Carolina Firefighters for Rudy represents first responders from across the state working to build a coalition designed to communicate Mayor Giuliani's proven record and optimistic vision.
"In our line of work, we firefighters have to count on one another on a daily basis," Hayes said. "Having seen Mayor Giuliani's support for firefighters in New York City, we know that we can count on Rudy."
"His determined leadership and willingness to face any adversity our country might see make him the right man to be the next President of the United States, and more and more firefighters are stepping up to help him," Hayes added. "We are proud to be able to support his campaign efforts here in South Carolina."
Today's announcement comes after Giuliani addressed firefighters from across South Carolina at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center during the 102nd Annual Conference of the South Carolina State Firefighters' Association. Jim Bowie, executive director of the South Carolina State Firefighters' Association, has signed as a co-chair of South Carolina Firefighters for Rudy.
