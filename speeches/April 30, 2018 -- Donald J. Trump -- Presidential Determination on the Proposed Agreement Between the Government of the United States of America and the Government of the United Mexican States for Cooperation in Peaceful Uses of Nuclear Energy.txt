Memorandum for the Secretary of State and the Secretary Energy 
Subject: Presidential Determination on the Proposed Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
I have considered the proposed Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the "Agreement"), along with the views, recommendations, and statements from interested departments and agencies.
I have determined that the performance of the proposed Agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby approve the proposed Agreement and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for its execution, pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)).
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
