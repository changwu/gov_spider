    NATO launched its relationship with Ukraine in 1997 as part of its strategy to reach out to former adversaries and to support their integration into NATO and other Euro-Atlantic institutions. Now in its eighth year, the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) has stimulated Ukrainian political, economic, and defense reform and improved Ukraine's ability to participate in NATO operations.

320 Ukrainian troops serve alongside NATO soldiers in KFOR, NATO's peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
Ukrainian personnel and units participate with NATO Allies and Partners in PfP exercises.
NATO and Ukraine meet regularly to explore additional ways to cooperate more closely and to support Ukraine's continued development. Prior to the Istanbul Summit, NATO leaders last met with Ukrainian President Kuchma during the 1999 NATO Summit in Washington.

The United States supports Ukraine aspirations for integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions, but achieving this goal depends on Ukraine following through with further democratic political, economic, and defense reform.
Ukraine's record on reform and in meeting its goals in the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan has been mixed. Ukraine has made progress in reforming its military and defense establishment and on economic reform. The United States, however, has been disappointed by the pace and level of democratic reform in Ukraine. Ukraine's presidential election in October will be a key indicator of Ukraine's commitment to the shared democratic values which are at the core of the Alliance.
