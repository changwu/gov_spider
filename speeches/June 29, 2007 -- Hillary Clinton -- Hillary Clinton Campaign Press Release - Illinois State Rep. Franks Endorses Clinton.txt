    McHenry Democrat is Noted Government Reform Watchdog
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Illinois State Representative Jack Franks, a respected government watchdog who chairs the State Government Administration Committee and sits on the Government Accountability committee.
"When it comes to reforming our government to make it work for the people, Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to lead that change," Franks said. "During these uncertain times we need someone who is ready to hit the ground running on day one, and that leader is Senator Clinton."
Rep. Franks has represented McHenry County since 1998, leading efforts to strengthen ethics standards and transparency in government as chair of the State Government Administration Committee. A leader in government accountability, Franks co-sponsored a bill to end pay-to-play practices in Illinois government. In addition, he has fought to improve state healthcare services, passing a Senior Citizen Prescription Drug Discount Program to guarantee affordable prescription drugs for all seniors and disabled persons, and pushing for the Patients' Bill of Rights that allows patients to make their own medical decisions.
"I'm honored to have the support of Rep. Franks," Clinton said. "We share the goal of restoring Americans' faith in their government and I am thrilled he is joining me and the millions of other Americans ready for change."
