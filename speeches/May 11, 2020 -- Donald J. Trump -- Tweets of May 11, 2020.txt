Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by "Concast" (NBC) for this fraud. He knew exactly what he was doing. Public Airwaves = Fake News! @AjitPaiFCC @FCC https://t.co/fLTDhjMXo4Retweets: 25387Favorites: 79783

This is why it's not really the Lamestream Media, it's the Rigged Media....and it is what I'm up against. It was corrupt in 2016. Now it is much more corrupt, and what you are seeing is the least of it....but WE WILL WIN AGAIN! https://t.co/UXyOrQ7fXWRetweets: 34022Favorites: 98494

The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don't play politics. Be safe, move quickly!Retweets: 34791Favorites: 134866
