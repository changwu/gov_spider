    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Strengthening Our Commitment to Service
Citizen service is one of the most important ways we demonstrate that we care for and are responsible for one another. It is also an American tradition that we meet our challenges as members of a true community, with all of us working together. Thus, citizen service should not just be a temporary pursuit of only a week or a month. The ethic of service must extend throughout a lifetime.
Over the years, great numbers of Federal employees have been generous with their time and talents and have made positive contributions to their local communities, even as they have fulfilled their official responsibilities. At the same time, as the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government has a responsibility to set an example by helping to make it possible for its employees to dedicate time to serve others.
Therefore, I am today directing Federal departments and agencies to explore additional measures to expand service opportunities for Federal employees. Each department and agency should review its work scheduling practices and make maximum use of existing flexibilities to allow Federal employees to plan and take time off to perform community service as the public business permits. Each department and agency should also inform its employees of the various flexibilities available to them to participate in volunteer activities. The Office of Personnel Management should provide information to departments and agencies in support of this effort. Each department and agency should then report to the Office of Personnel Management within 90 days on the measures taken to implement this memorandum.
