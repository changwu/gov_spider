    In case you missed it, watch Karl Rove discussing Gov. Tim Pawlenty's new IA ad on Hannity here.
Rove: I like it. It is a conviction ad and says here's what I have done as governor and puts his experience up against anybody else in the crowd. There's a little bit of a hint of a Romney thing there, a little Chris Christie note with the I took on the unions. Again, a good introductory ad. And again, his buy, we don't know exactly the details on the buy. But he had a pretty substantial buy before it appears, and he's now up with a second ad, and that shows he's going to be serious about contesting Iowa.
