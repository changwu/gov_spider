The Herald said that Dole is a "fiscal conservative, dedicated to balancing the federal budget, reforming welfare, returning more responsibilities to the states and helping bolster the role of American families."
The Herald praised the "experience Bob Dole has built up over more than a decade of leading his party in the U.S. Senate." The paper said that Dole has the "skills that are needed in the White House, A president needs to say "no" to demands. He also needs to say "yes" to get things done. No one else in the Republican field has been in that position and, quite frankly the White House is no place for on-the-job training ... it takes judgment and maturity to run this country.
Summed up the editorial: "The Herald is pleased to endorse the candidacy of Senator Bob Dole for the Republican presidential nomination and urges New Englanders to give him their votes."
"We're delighted by the endorsement from the Boston Herald," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "The Herald is a highly respected newspaper in the New England area and its editorials have a real impact in the political arena."

A recent Times/CNN poll shows Dole leading the Republican field with 47 percent of the vote -- 30 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival.
