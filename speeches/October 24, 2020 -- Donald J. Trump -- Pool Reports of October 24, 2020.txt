On election: Numbers are coming in unbelievably well.We have ten days, nothing worries me.
We had some very strong polls come out. We're two points out in Michigan.
We're going to have a great red wave. It's going to be a red wave like you have never seen before.
On Biden campaign: I don't think they're doing very well.
On COVID cases rising: Mortality way down. A lot of those cases are young people who get better almost immediately.
But we have more testing than any country in the world.
On voting this am: I voted straight Republican.

 October 24, 2020 16:47

 WH Travel pool #15 - more POTUS quotes 
?Here are fuller quotes from the President's gaggle under the wing at Columbus airport (motorcade is still in route to Circleville):
On the election: "We're going to take this right up until the end and then I suspect I'll rest for about two hours but we'll see what happens. But I think we're doing very well. The numbers are coming in unbelievably well. I don't believe the media is talking about them. I'm not sure the media knows exactly what is happening yet but in Florida we're doing well; North Carolina doing well. Iowa doing very well. The governor was just telling me that in Ohio we're doing great."
More on election: "Well we have ten days, and you know nothing worries me. I think we're doing just very well you look at the numbers in Florida. We're way ahead than where we were four years ago right? Way ahead where we were four years ago, and I think I can say that everywhere else in North Carolina, we're way ahead than where we were four years ago. I don't know if it is a hidden vote. I don't know what it is."
On Florida and North Carolina: "If you look at the early vote it is not nearly what they thought it would be. It's just not what they thought. A great red wave going to be a red wave like you've never seen before because people are tired of looking at the anarchist all the things taking place in Portland, Chicago, New York, with crime. They're tired of it but you have a red wave the likes of which you haven't seen and everybody knows it. And they, you know, I don't think they're doing very well. They have no enthusiasm like Obama shows up for a speech and nobody shows - what is did he have 32 people show up we have 35,000 half the people. What's the smallest crowd been 20 works 22,000 people? Right?"
On rising COVID cases: You use the word cases you know why there's so many cases because we test because we test more than any -- any country in the world nobody tests like us. Cases - everybody uses word cases. Mortality way down. Way down, and a lot of those cases that you are talking about are young people. Very young people that get better - 99.9 per they get better almost immediately. No. Use the word cases because you're trying to scare people. Don't scare people. Don't scare people. The fact is, that we're doing very well the vaccines are coming out; therapeutics are coming out but we have more testing than any country in the world that includes India with 1.5 billion people. Nobody test like us. We test more. Now the good news is we know where it may be. The bad news is, any time you're testing you're going to come up with cases but you just use the word as cases."
On voting this am: "I voted straight Republican."
