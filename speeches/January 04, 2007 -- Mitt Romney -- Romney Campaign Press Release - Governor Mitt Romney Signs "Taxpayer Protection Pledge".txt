Boston, MA - Demonstrating his commitment to oppose any effort to increase taxes on the American people, Governor Romney has signed Americans For Tax Reform's "Taxpayer Protection Pledge." As part of his pledge, Governor Romney will "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates" and "oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits."
Governor Romney believes that by keeping taxes low and simplifying the tax code, we can grow the economy and enhance American competitiveness. These fundamental economic beliefs and principles led Governor Romney to become the first potential 2008 presidential candidate to sign Americans For Tax Reform's "Taxpayer Protection Pledge."
