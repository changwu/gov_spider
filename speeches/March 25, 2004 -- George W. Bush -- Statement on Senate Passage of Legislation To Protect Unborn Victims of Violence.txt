    I applaud the Senate for passing the "Unborn Victims of Violence Act" today by a strong bipartisan vote. We must continue to build a culture of life in our country, a compassionate society in which every child is welcomed in life and protected by law.
Pregnant women who have been harmed by violence, and their families, know that there are two victims—the mother and the unborn child—and both victims should be protected by Federal law.
I look forward to signing this important legislation into law.
