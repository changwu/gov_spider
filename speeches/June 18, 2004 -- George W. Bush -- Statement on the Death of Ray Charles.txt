    Ray Charles Robinson was a heroâ€”the child who faced down adversity and worked hard to become one of the greatest examples of the American Dream. His songs have lifted us in times of sorrow and helped us celebrate in times of joy.
His music and his optimism touched the lives and hearts of millions and spanned generations, cultures, races, and backgrounds. People from all walks of life would come together and tap their feet as one when Ray Charles played.
Laura and I send our prayers and condolences to his family and friends.
