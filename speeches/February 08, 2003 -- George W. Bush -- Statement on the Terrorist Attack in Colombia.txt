    Last night, terrorists attacked a nightclub in Bogota, Colombia. The latest reports are that 25 innocent men and women were killed and more than 150 wounded.
On behalf of the United States, I condemn this barbaric act of terrorism. I offer our deepest condolences to the Colombian families and friends of all who were murdered. We also hope and pray for the quick recovery of those that were injured.
I extend to President Uribe and the people of Colombia our deepest sympathy for this horrible tragedy.
We stand with the Colombian people in their fight against narcoterrorists who threaten their democratic way of life.
We will offer all appropriate assistance to the Colombian Government in bringing to justice the murderers responsible for this act.
