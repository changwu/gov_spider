Congratulations to all of my many friends at The Villages in Florida on having done so well, and with such great spirit, during these rather unusual times. So proud of everyone! Mark Morse & Gary Lester have really stepped up to the plate. Hope to see everyone soon.Retweets: 15814Favorites: 86787

Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, "Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators."

This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!Retweets: 21803Favorites: 97880
