(Senate)(Rep. Faircloth (R) NC)
The Administration strongly opposes the enactment of S. 1788. If presented to the President, the Secretary of Labor would recommend that the bill be vetoed.
S. 1788 would repeal the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act that allow employers and unions to enter into agreements requiring all employees to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. Enactment of S. 1788 would seriously undermine the ability of unions to represent American workers and to protect workers' rights.
