    During Down Syndrome Awareness Month, Melania and I join in celebrating the lives of the more than 250,000 Americans with Down syndrome and those around the world with this condition. Together, we recommit to deepening our understanding of Down syndrome and learning more about how we can ensure the beautiful people with Down syndrome are able to fully participate in society. We will always support the dreams of those with Down syndrome and respect and honor the sanctity of their lives at every stage.
Today, as a result of advances in research and treatment, people with Trisomy 21, or "Down syndrome," are leading healthier and longer lives. Through innovative speech, occupational, and physical therapies, we are finding new ways to build upon the physical and intellectual abilities of children and babies with Down syndrome. We are learning more about this condition and the increased need for widespread education and acceptance. These efforts help to ensure many of our youngest citizens with this condition are able to live fulfilling, independent, and productive lives.
All people are endowed by their Creator with dignity and the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Despite some persistent myths and stigmas, even within the medical community, our Nation strongly embraces the undeniable truth that a Down syndrome diagnosis is an opportunity to embrace God's gifts. I stand for life—in all of its beautiful manifestations—and I, and my administration, will continue to condemn the prejudice and discrimination that Americans with Down syndrome too often endure.
During this month, we vow to continue creating opportunities for and supporting the extraordinary men, women, and children with Down syndrome. Every day, they inspire us to live with great love, joy, and appreciation for our world and those who make it a truly unique and special place to live. Life is precious, and it is our moral duty to protect and defend it.
