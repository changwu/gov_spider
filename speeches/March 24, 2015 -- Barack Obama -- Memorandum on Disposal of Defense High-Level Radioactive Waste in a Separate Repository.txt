    Memorandum for the Secretary of Energy
Subject: Disposal of Defense High-Level Radioactive Waste in a Separate Repository
Your memorandum and accompanying report of January 9, 2015, analyze the factors enumerated in section 8 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the "Act") concerning disposal of high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomic energy defense activities, conclude that a strong basis exists to find a separate repository is required pursuant to section 8 of the Act, and recommend that I make this finding.
In accordance with the Act, I find the development of a repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomic energy defense activities only is required.
