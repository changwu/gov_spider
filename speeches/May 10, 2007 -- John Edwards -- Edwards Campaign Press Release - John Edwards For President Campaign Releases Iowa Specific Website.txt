    JohnEdwards.com/Iowa gives voters direct link to campaign in their area
Des Moines, Iowa – The John Edwards for President campaign today released a website specifically for Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus goers. The web site, www.JohnEdwards.com/Iowa, provides Iowans with information on how to get involved in the campaign as well as details on Edwards' bold and specific plans on issues from Iraq to universal health care. It also tracks John and Elizabeth Edwards travels throughout Iowa and it will include pictures and video of their discussions with everyday Iowans.
"Iowa is the first stop in our drive to change America—and success here is going to be critical," said Edwards. "Elizabeth and I have had many opportunities to visit with Iowans over the past few years, but this web site will give Iowans the chance to learn more about my plans for bold change. Most importantly, it is a tool that will help Iowans get involved in the important challenges facing our country today."
The Iowa website—which will be regularly updated—includes:


News from the campaign trail
Pictures and video of John and Elizabeth Edwards as they visit with Iowans
Downloadable fact sheets and other items so that caucus goers can learn about Edwards' positions on the issues—and then share that information with friends and neighbors
A six minute video detailing John Edwards plan for universal health coverage
Lists of upcoming events
Many ways to get involved, including registering as a supporter of the campaign, offering to volunteer, and an email feature allowing Iowans to invite friends and family to visit the site and learn more about the campaign
A page allowing caucus goers to get in contact with the nearest campaign office

Additional features and information will be added throughout the campaign, and Edwards invited Iowans—whether they are already supporters or still undecided—to check back at the page frequently to hear the latest news from the campaign.
