ANKENY, Iowa - 2012 Presidential candidate Ron Paul's whistle-stop tour of Iowa, done today in concert with his son U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), yielded uncharacteristically-large crowds often numbering in the hundreds.
The Polk County Whistle Stop in Downtown Des Moines attracted more than 700 supporters, the Scott County Whistle Stop held in Davenport drew more than 350 people, and the Linn County Whistle Stop held in Cedar Rapids yielded more than 300 people.
In addition, the Black Hawk County Whistle Stop in Cedar Falls drew more than 300 supporters, and the Cerro Gordo County Whistle Stop in Mason City attracted more than 200 voters.
"The excitement is palpable as Ron and Rand Paul make Ron's closing arguments to the hundreds of supporters who braved the cold, windy weather to see the Pauls. We hope this level of energy, so unique to Ron Paul's candidacy, propels us to a strong top-three finish in tomorrow's caucus," said Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers.
