    President Obama's threat to veto the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act shows just how much he is out of touch with the American people.
The American people want to cut spending—President Obama says no.
The American people believe Washington spending is out of control and Washington government is too big-they want to cap it— President Obama says no.
The American people want a balanced budget amendment—President Obama says no.
President Obama is the anti-Reagan. President Reagan galvanized and led the American people to force change in Washington. President Obama wants to hold secret meetings in Washington to draft and pass massive bills that coerce the American people through his bureaucratic decrees.
Congress should side with the American people and stand up to the bully in the pulpit.
