    Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former Congressman Lane Evans. Lane was a proud veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and dedicated much of his public life to helping his fellow veterans, particularly those who fought in Vietnam and were exposed to agent orange. Lane was one of my earliest supporters when I ran for the Senate, and I was proud to have him by my side when Iâ€”when I was elected President. Above all, Lane was an American hero, a dear friend, and a beloved public servant of the people of Illinois. Michelle and I extend our thoughts and prayers to Lane's family and friends and the people he represented in Congress who loved him so dearly.
