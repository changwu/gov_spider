    The United States welcomes the decision this week by the Government of the Netherlands to send up to eight F-16 fighters and 250 support personnel to conduct airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. In addition, the Netherlands will dispatch up to 130 military personnel to assist with the training of Iraqi Security Forces. This military contribution is in addition to broader actions the Dutch government has already taken, including providing humanitarian assistance and diplomatic support, taking steps to counter the illicit financing of terrorism, and enacting measures to help prevent the movement of foreign fighters. These actions demonstrate the continued commitment and leadership by the Dutch to take action as necessary to counter threats to international peace and stability. The United States is proud of its longstanding friendship and partnership with the Netherlands and its people, and we look forward to working closely with them and other international partners in our comprehensive approach to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.
