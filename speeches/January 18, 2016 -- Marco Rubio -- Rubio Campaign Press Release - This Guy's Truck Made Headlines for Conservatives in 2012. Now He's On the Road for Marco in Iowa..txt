Jim Wilson (or simply "Wilson," more often than not) is the kind of activist every campaign wants on their side.
He has made a name for himself in conservative circles traveling across the country, helping promote Republican candidates with his sign-adorned pickup truck.

In 2012, Wilson's truck sadly caught fire as he was campaigning against President Obama.
A certain Republican helped him replace the truck, and now it's been upgraded for 2016:

Why is Wilson backing Marco? Here's what he had to say:
Good coaches anticipate the 4th Quarter at the kickoff. Marco is the only candidate who can do 3 things — he can win the nomination, he can unite the party, and he can beat Hillary.

Wilson traveled over 1,000 miles from his home in Virginia to campaign in his native Iowa. Obviously, his truck turns heads wherever it goes.

So what's next for Wilson and the truck? A little bit more, he says:
It's not fully decked out yet. I have another package coming in to Des Moines so I can make a homecoming float out of it.

Needless to say, we're happy to welcome Wilson and the legendary pickup to Team Marco!
