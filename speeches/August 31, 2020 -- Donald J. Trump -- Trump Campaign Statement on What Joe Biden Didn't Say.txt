    "As predicted, Joe Biden today failed to condemn the left-wing mobs burning, looting, and terrorizing American cities. He failed to condemn Antifa. He failed to condemn people who called the police a 'cancer' or people on his campaign staff who called them 'pigs.' He failed to apologize for his campaign staff donating to a fund which bailed violent criminals out of jail in Minneapolis. He failed to urge Democrat governors to call in the National Guard. He failed to urge Democrat mayors to allow the federal government to help. In short, he failed.
"These left-wing rioters are Joe Biden supporters trashing cities run by Democrats who support his candidacy. He has repeatedly given them cover by excusing their violence by calling them 'peaceful protestors' and accusing law enforcement of 'stoking the fires of division.' At the same time, he has condoned the 'Defund the Police' movement by agreeing to cut police funding, further egging on anti-police radicals in his party. In truth, if you listen to Biden, it's almost impossible to tell where his campaign ends and Antifa begins. You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."
