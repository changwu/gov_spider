    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Broomfie1d (R) Michigan)
The Administration opposes enactment of the Broomfield amendment because it:
— authorizes insufficient funding levels for security assistance programs, while increasing funding beyond the President's request in certain other programs.
The Administration is also concerned about several provisions which we would seek to resolve in conference. These provisions:
— unduly limit Presidential discretion and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affairs by providing restrictions on the use of funds for obligation and disbursement for specific countries, projects, and accounts;
— unacceptably limit Presidential flexibility concerning Central America;
— contain numerous unnecessary reporting and certification requirements;
— raise substantial constitutional concerns regarding the separation of powers principle (sec. 1207); and
— authorize a potentially costly scholarship program for undergraduate students from developing countries.
In addition, of the provisions that would not be subject to conference, the Administration objects to the requirement to disburse ESF to Israel within thirty .days as this undermines efforts to negotiate an economic reform program. As well, the Department of Justice advises that a number of provisions raise substantial constitutional concerns regarding the President's power to conduct foreign affairs (secs. 514, 720, and 1206).
