    Newt Gingrich released the following draft of an executive order permitting the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The executive order is just one part of Newt Gingrich's "Day One Plan" in the 21st Century Contract with America to rapidly undo the damage caused by the Obama administration and shift our country to productivity and job creation once again.
