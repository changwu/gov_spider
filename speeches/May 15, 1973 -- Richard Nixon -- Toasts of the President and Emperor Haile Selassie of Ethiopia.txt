    Your Imperial Majesty and our very distinguished guests:
As I sat here in this room tonight thinking of this very distinguished company, I thought how fortunate all of us are. This Nation is 195 years old, this house is about 185 years old, and in the whole long history of this Nation, no chief of state, no head of government has been received more often, honored more often, than is the man we honor tonight.
Many of us remember him, of course, from those days when he stood at the old League of Nations as the Lion of Judah, 37 years ago, and captured the imagination of everybody who loved freedom and independence all over the world.
But through the years, those of us who have followed him since know that this man, the man we receive again in this house tonight, stands for far more than his own country, great as that country is and long as its proud history is, because His Imperial Majesty, who for 57 years has been the head of state--57 years--His Imperial Majesty is not only the revered leader of Ethiopia, as anyone who has visited that country knows--and I have visited it twice---he is the acknowledged leader of Africa, and the Organization of African States, of course, is located in his capital.
And so tonight, I could propose a toast to him as the leader of Ethiopia, a country that the United States is proud to have a long and very, very friendly relationship with over the years. I could propose a toast to him as a great leader of Africa, that continent with all of the promise that it holds for the future. But tonight we are privileged even beyond that, because in our midst, here again in this house, being honored more than any man who has ever been in this house, is the senior statesman of the world, and how privileged we are to raise our glasses to the senior statesman of the world, His Irapedal Majesty, Haile Selassie.
