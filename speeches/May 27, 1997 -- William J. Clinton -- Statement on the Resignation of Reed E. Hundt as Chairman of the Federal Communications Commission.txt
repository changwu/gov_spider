    It was with regret that I learned today that Reed Hundt, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, intends to leave before the end of his term, upon appointment of his successor.
Chairman Hundt has been a strong and visionary leader of the FCC during this historic period in telecommunications policy. His steadfast commitment to the public interest and to bringing the benefits of competition to consumers is evident in his many accomplishments during his tenure, including the successful launching of spectrum auctions and the Commission's ontime implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. His expertise and counsel were indispensable in bringing home this year's World Trade Organization agreement on telecommunications, which will open markets abroad as never before.
Perhaps most importantly, Chairman Hundt helped make the FCC an advocate for our children. He reinvigorated children's broadcasting, and he took pathbreaking steps to ensure that every classroom and library in America will be linked to the information superhighway.
Chairman Hundt's leadership has opened opportunity to businesses here and abroad, while ensuring that all Americans share in the benefits of the telecommunications revolution. The Vice President and I are sorry to see him go and extend to him thanks on behalf of the American people for his excellent service.
