(New York, NY) January 18th, 2016 â€” Today Donald J. Trump unveiled a new radio ad to begin airing in Iowa and New Hampshire featuring his daughter Ivanka Trump.
Mr. Trump stated, "My family has been so supportive of me and my candidacy and I am so proud of Ivanka. She is a terrific person, a devoted mother and an exceptional entrepreneur. Ivanka is doing a fantastic job running my company, alongside her brothers, and is building many of my biggest jobs. It is so important to have the support of all of my children and I'm really proud of this ad."
The ad features Ivanka talking about her father as only a daughter can. She discusses what it was like to grow up learning from the GOP frontrunner, and what he taught her about becoming a great entrepreneur and parent.
Ivanka added, "My father has experienced unparalleled success in business over many decades and built an amazing company that employs thousands of people. I have witnessed his vision, strength and competence each day of my life. He has been an incredible father to me and my siblings and I love him very much."
Mr. Trump continues to lead all national and state polls, with the Iowa Caucus just two weeks away. Last Thursday Mr. Trump participated in the sixth Republican Presidential debate in South Carolina after which he was unanimously declared the winner.
