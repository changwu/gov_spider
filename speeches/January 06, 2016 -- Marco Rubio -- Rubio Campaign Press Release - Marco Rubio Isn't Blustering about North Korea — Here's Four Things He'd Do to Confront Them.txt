President Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies of appeasement helped set the stage for this. Here's what he had to say in Iowa today:

 
But what would he do to reverse this? 
Good question — that's what one Iowa voter asked. Here's his answer.

 
1. Put North Korea back on the State Sponsors of Terror list.

2. Ratchet up sanctions on the wealthy and corrupt North Korean regime.

3. Rebuild our military alliances in the Pacific, especially by restoring our Navy's strength.

4. Recommit to missile defense, because North Korea already has ballistic missiles capable of hitting us at home.

Replacing the weak Obama-Clinton foreign policy with one of strength isn't not just about rhetoric.
Marco knows better than any of his opponents the steps we need to take and what is required to keep Americans safe.
