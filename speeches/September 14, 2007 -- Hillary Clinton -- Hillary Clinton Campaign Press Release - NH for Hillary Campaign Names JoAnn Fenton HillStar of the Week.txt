    MANCHESTER, NH - The New Hampshire for Hillary Campaign today announced JoAnn Fenton as the campaign's HillStar of the Week. JoAnn, a Keene resident, regularly participates in canvassing and phone calls on the campaign's behalf, and also supplies the Keene office with food for its volunteers.
"I've always admired Hillary Clinton," said Fenton. "She's the whole package - smart, hardworking, experienced, and has the relationships domestically and internationally to build on when she's president. When Hillary is president, no one will be invisible to her."
Fenton, a writer, is also Co-Chair of the Keene Family YMCA Capital Campaign. She and her husband have two children. She has been volunteering for the Hillary's campaign since February.
"I am very grateful for JoAnn's hard work on behalf of my New Hampshire campaign," said Senator Clinton. "Volunteers like JoAnn will help make this campaign a success."
Every week, the NH for Hillary campaign will name a HillStar of the Week to recognize one volunteer who demonstrates extraordinary commitment and dedication to the campaign. HillStars will be featured on the NH for Hillary webpage at www.hillaryclinton.com/nh.
