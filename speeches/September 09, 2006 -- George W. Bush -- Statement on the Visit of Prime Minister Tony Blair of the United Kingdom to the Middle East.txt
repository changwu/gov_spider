    I am pleased that Prime Minister Blair will be visiting Lebanon, Israel, and the Palestinian Territories. The deployment of increasing numbers of international forces in an enhanced United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which enabled the lifting of the air and sea blockade of Lebanon, makes this a timely visit. The Prime Minister will be discussing ways to facilitate the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701, including enforcing the ban on unauthorized arms shipments to Hizballah from Iran and Syria. I understand the Prime Minister will also be exploring ways to advance the dialog between Israelis and Palestinians and the two-state solution, a democratic Israel and democratic Palestine living side by side in peace and security. I wish him well in his efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.
