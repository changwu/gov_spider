    Presidential Action
Today, President Bush and the other G-8 Leaders agreed on an Action Plan designed to care for our environment while growing our economies. The Plan builds on U.S. initiatives to develop transformational technologies in three areas: energy, agriculture, and global observation.
The Challenge: Promoting economic growth while securing a better quality of life for people around the world calls for the development and deployment of cleaner and more cost-effective technologies. For instance, next generation energy technologies will be able to provide more reliable energy while dramatically reducing the health burdens of pollution.
G-8 Response: Today, G-8 Partners agreed to Cooperative Action on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development, and will:

Develop (1) hydrogen fuel cell technology and infrastructure aimed at making fuel cell vehicles price competitive within two decades, (2) cleaner fossil fuel technologies, including cleaner coal, and (3) new-generation nuclear technologies.
Promote agricultural technologies and practices, including biotechnology, to prevent famine, enhance nutrition, improve productivity, conserve water and natural resources, reduce the application of chemicals and improve human health and biodiversity. Carry forward this commitment by participation in the U.S.-hosted Agricultural Science and Technology Ministerial Conference, June 23-25, 2003.
Build a better integrated global observation system over 10 years, to be kicked off at the Earth Observation Summit in Washington, D.C. on July 31, 2003.

Other U.S. Actions: The U.S. is investing $1.7 billion in the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology and hydrogen powered "Freedom Car." The U.S. is also spending $1 billion on the world's first zero-emission coal power plant.
