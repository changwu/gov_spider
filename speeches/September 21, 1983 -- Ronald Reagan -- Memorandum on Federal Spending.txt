    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Reducing and Controlling Wasteful Year-End Spending
Prevention of waste and inefficiency in Federal programs is a top priority of this Administration at any time of year. It has a special priority now. The end of the fiscal year is approaching and the temptation is great to obligate funds simply so that they will not lapse and be unavailable for obligation after September 30.
In a memorandum dated June 21, 1983, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget provided guidance to you on ways to prevent wasteful year-end spending. I ask you now, in the remaining days of this fiscal year, to redouble your efforts to prevent this form of waste.
It is absolutely essential that we do everything in our power to restrain the growth of Federal spending. Avoiding wasteful year-end spending is an obvious way to help do that, one that the taxpayers have every right to expect of us.
I know that I can count on your continued personal attention to this effort.
RONALD REAGAN
