    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Consistent with my constitutional authority and section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act, as amended, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Request Act.
The proposed Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For Fiscal Year 2005, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $6.26 billion.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
