    Mayor Rudy Giuliani continued to build his New York Leadership Team today with Congressman Jim Walsh announcing his support. Congressman Walsh is the longest serving Republican member of New York's congressional delegation and is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.
"I've always enjoyed working with Jim Walsh. He's a tremendous voice for his district and for New York's congressional delegation and I'm honored to have his support," Mayor Giuliani said.
Congressman Walsh said, "I know what Rudy Giuliani can do. I was proud to work with Rudy while he was Mayor and I've seen the direct results of his actions and his demands for accountability and high standards. When times are tough, he's the leader you want, and I'm proud to support him for President."
In 2006, Congressman Walsh was elected to his tenth term representing New York's 25th district. Walsh's endorsement follows recent endorsements from Congressmen Peter King and Vito Fossella, and the announcement that former New York State Republican Party Chairman Bill Powers and former Congressman Guy Molinari will chair Mayor Giuliani's New York statewide efforts.
