    The President. This morning Director Porter Goss offered his resignation as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I've accepted it.
During the course of his tenure, I've established a very close personal relationship with Porter, which is very important for the Director of the CIA. He's spent a lot of time here in the Oval Office. He's told me—he's given me his candid advice. I appreciate his integrity. I appreciate the honor in which—that he brought to the job.
Porter's tenure at the CIA was one of transition. He's helped this Agency become integrated into the intelligence community, and that was a tough job. And he's led ably. He's got a 5-year plan to increase the number of analysts and operatives, which is going to help make this country a safer place and help us win the war on terror. He's instilled a sense of professionalism. He honors the proud history of the CIA, an organization that is known for its secrecy in accountability. I am confident that his successor will continue the reforms that he's put in place, and as a result, this country will be more secure.
We've got to win the war on terror, and the Central Intelligence Agency is a vital part of that war. And so I want to thank you for your service.
[At this point, Director Goss made brief remarks.]
The President. God bless. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you very much.
