    The President yesterday declared a major disaster exists for the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and ordered federal aid to supplement the Oglala Sioux Tribe's efforts in the area affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding during the period of May 8-29, 2015.
The President's action makes federal funding available to affected members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the Tribe.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Gary R. Stanley as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Tribe and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
FEMA said that residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated area can begin applying for assistance today by registering online at http://www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA(3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.
