    Hillary Clinton issued the following statement in support of the striking members of the United Auto Workers.
"Today, I reaffirm my support and stand in solidarity with the men and women of the UAW who have been forced to strike in defense of their jobs. The decision to strike is never an easy one and negotiations involve the fundamental issues of health security for workers and retirees, fair wages, retirement protection and job security.
"As President, I will continue my efforts to rebuild our manufacturing industry, to provide good jobs with health and retirement security, and to honor the hard work of unions like the UAW.
"We have a shared interest in a healthy and successful US auto industry, and I hope the current dispute can be resolved quickly and equitably for the benefit of the workers and Chrysler."
