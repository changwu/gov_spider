    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Howard of Australia to Washington on September 10. The United States and Australia are treaty allies and share a long history of close friendship and cooperation. The President is particularly pleased to welcome the Prime Minister this year, which marks the 100th year of the Australian federation and the 50th anniversary of the U.S.-Australia alliance. Australians and Americans have fought side by side in every war this past century and continue to work together to promote shared values and common interests. The President looks forward to discussing regional security issues, exploring how best to advance our free trade goals, and reaffirming the strength and vitality of the U.S. partnership with Australia.
