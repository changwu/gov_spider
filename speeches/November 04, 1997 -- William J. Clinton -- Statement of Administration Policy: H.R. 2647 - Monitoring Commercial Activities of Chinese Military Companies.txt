    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Fowler (R) FL and 16 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2647 because it is unnecessary and counterproductive. In particular, the Administration opposes the requirement to disclose publicly the list of Chinese military companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States. The requirement for such disclosure could implicate classified information that needs to be protected in the interests of national security, i.e., intelligence sources and methods.
The Administration is also seriously concerned about the precedent of authorizing the exercise of authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) without regard to the Act?s strict standards of an international threat. H.R. 2647 establishes no clear standards for invoking the IEEPA authorities against Chinese military companies and bears no relation to the effect on the United States of the commercial activities of the designated Chinese companies. If the People?s Liberation Army companies, or any other foreign companies, undertake specific illegal activities, there are U.S. laws authorizing a broad range of sanctions. In cases when U.S. law is violated, the Administration can, and will, act to enforce the law.
