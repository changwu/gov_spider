    Former Iowa GOP Chairman and Mitt Romney supporter Brian Kennedy made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"President Obama's policies have failed the middle class. It is clear that this Administration would rather distract from its failed record and not talk about the economy. Instead of creating jobs and getting spending under control, President Obama and his Democratic allies have focused on attacking Mitt Romney."
