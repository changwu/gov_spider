Backley was born July 21, 1927, in Chicago. He received an LL.B. from De Paul University in 1955.
Backley practiced law in Chicago from 1955 to 1957 and was a trial counsel for Montgomery Ward from 1957 to 1960. From 1960 to 1967, he was District Attorney for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
From 1967 to 1970, Backley was attorney adviser to the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration (now EPA) at the Interior Department. In 1970, with the enactment of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, he became a senior trial attorney with the newly formed Division of Mine Health and Safety at Interior.
In 1974 Backley was certified as an administrative law judge. The same year he was promoted to the position of Assistant Solicitor in the Division of Mine Health and Safety, where he supervised a staff of 19 attorneys which handled all administrative proceedings involving mine safety before administrative law judges.
Since 1975 Backley has been an administrative law judge with the Civil Aeronautics Board.
