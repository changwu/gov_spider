    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) commends the conservative leadership of the House of Representatives on the passage of the "Cut, Cap, and Balance" legislation:
"I am pleased that the House of Representatives passed the reasonable and responsible 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' legislation to bring fiscal sanity back to Washington. I commend the Republicans in the House who had the courage to take this important step towards getting our fiscal house in order and I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead. The time for posturing and rhetoric has passed, now is the time for the leadership the American people deserve from their representatives."
Senator Santorum was among the first presidential contenders to sign the "Cut, Cap, and Balance" Pledge that focuses on cutting and capping government spending, and passing a Balanced Budget Amendment to our Constitution. Senator Santorum has long been a defender of the Balanced Budget Amendment, with it being among the first bills he ever cosponsored in the United States Senate in 1995.
