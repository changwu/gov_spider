    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Luken (D) Ohio)
The Administration has no objection to extension of the deadline for submission of asbestos management plans, but will seek amendments in the Senate to (1) delete provisions requiring burdensome and unnecessary progress reports, and (2) simplify the process for obtaining extensions. Further, Congress should consider whether the July 1989 implementation deadline is achievable given the delay in submittal of the managemerit plans.
