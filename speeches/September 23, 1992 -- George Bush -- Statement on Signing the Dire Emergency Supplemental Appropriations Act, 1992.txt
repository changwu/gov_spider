    Today I am signing into law H.R. 5620, an Act that provides supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance to meet urgent needs resulting from Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki, and Typhoon Omar. This will make urgently needed assistance available immediately.
H.R. 5620 provides $10.6 billion in emergency funding for disaster programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and a number of other departments and agencies. These departments and agencies are continuing to provide assistance to victims of the natural disasters. The FEMA funds will be used to provide individuals and families with temporary housing assistance and to provide loans and grants for the repair and replacement of property. The SBA funds will be used to provide low-interest loans to individuals and businesses located in areas affected by the disasters.
In accordance with the applicable provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, I am designating the funding identified in the Attachment, "Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Recent Disasters," as emergency requirements.
In addition to disaster-related emergency funding, H.R. 5620 provides nonemergency FY 1992 supplemental appropriations of $3.5 billion for costs related to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and $2.1 billion for other purposes, including a cost-of-living adjustment for veterans compensation and pension payments. This Act also provides $500 million in FY 1993 appropriations, subject to the enactment of authorizing legislation, for urban aid to distressed cities.
