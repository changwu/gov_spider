    Earlier today, Vice President Biden spoke with Osama al-Nujaifi, the Speaker of the previous session of Iraq's Council of Representatives. The Vice President underscored the United States' support for Iraq in its efforts to isolate and defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which is a threat to all Iraqis. The Vice President commended Nujaifi for his patriotism in putting aside his candidacy for a new term as speaker of the parliament in an effort to move Iraq forward and accelerate the government formation process. Both leaders agreed that all Iraqi political forces must work to form a new government that enjoys a broad national acceptance as rapidly as possible.
