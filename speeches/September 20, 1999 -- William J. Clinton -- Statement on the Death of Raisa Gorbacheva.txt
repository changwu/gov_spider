    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Raisa Maksimovna Gorbacheva, wife of former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. We extend our deepest condolences to her family and friends in Russia and other countries. The example she set through her help for child victims of leukemia and through her own courageous struggle against this terrible disease was an inspiration to people everywhere.
