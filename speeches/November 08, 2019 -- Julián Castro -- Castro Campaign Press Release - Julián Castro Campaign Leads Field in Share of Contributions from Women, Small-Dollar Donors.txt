    SAN ANTONIO, TX (November 8, 2019) – Presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro received the highest share of campaign contributions of all the candidates in the 2020 field from women, according to Open Secrets.
Castro also leads the field in share of contributions from small dollar donors, at 74%, according to Axios. Secretary Castro was the first 2020 candidate to commit to refuse contributions from political action committees and federal lobbyists, and joined a pledge to refuse contributions of more than $200 from fossil fuel executives. Additionally, teachers and educators make up the largest share of Secretary Castro's contributions from various professions.
"?I'm proud to have the highest ratio of contributions from women in this campaign—and the highest ratio of donations from small dollar donors," said Secretary Julián Castro. "?This campaign has, and always will, be driven by grassroots support and putting People First.?"
Secretary Castro has met the threshold of grassroots contributions needed to make the November debate, and is closing in on the contributions needed for the December debates. Billionaire Tom Steyer has secured his spot on the November debate stage after spending more than $47 million on his presidential campaign. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is expected to file his paperwork to enter the presidential race in the coming days.
The Castro campaign operates solely on grassroots donations, and more than 99% of contributions are $100 or less.
