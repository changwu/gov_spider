    Please extend to Her Majesty and to all the members and peoples of the British Commonwealth my deep personal sympathy on the passing of Queen Mary. The hearts of all Americans go out to Her Majesty tonight as our prayers are extended to her, Princess Margaret and the members of the Royal Family for the great personal loss they have sustained. Queen Mary was a good and great Queen. Free peoples the world over will mourn her loss.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
