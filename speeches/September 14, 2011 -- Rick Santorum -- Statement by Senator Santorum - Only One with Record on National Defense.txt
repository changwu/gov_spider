    From the Washington Post: Rick Santorum said, "As I said on Greta Van Susteren's show last night, I listened to both men answer and I couldn't believe that neither person mentioned the word victory. To stand for anything less is a disservice to our troops, their families, and our nation. Let me be clear, I hate war - and every day I pray for our troops safe and speedy return. In fact, I believe our troops should come home as soon as the job is done. But the problem is, Barack Obama has never outlined a mission for victory. We cannot leave the region when there is still a good chance the Taliban can take control. To leave leadership in the hands of a radical terrorist group, known for its horrific treatment of women and for carrying out unprovoked terrorist attacks on this country - with promises for more - is something I am unwilling to do. The number one job of our president is to defend America, and for Governor Perry to skirt this complicated issue for an applause line shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the region and a level of inexperience only topped by our current president."
