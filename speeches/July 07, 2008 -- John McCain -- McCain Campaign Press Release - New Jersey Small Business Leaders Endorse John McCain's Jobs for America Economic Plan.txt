    WOODBRIDGE, NJ -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of its New Jersey Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition. At a press conference at the Statehouse, small business owners from around New Jersey endorsed John McCain's economic plan, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president.
"As president, John McCain will continue to support the small business community," said Frank Formica, owner of Formica Brother's Bakery in Atlantic City. "John McCain understands that small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and he'll work to create an economic climate that creates jobs and encourages investment."
New Jersey has an estimated 828,400 small businesses, which employ more than half of the state's private labor force. Small businesses are the heart of New Jersey's economy, creating jobs, generating revenue, and providing needed supplies and services.
"Every small business in New Jersey has a unique story to tell," said John Everitt, owner of the New Providence, NJ, technology firm Evertech. "To small business owners, these establishments represent long hours, hard work, personal investment, and proud family traditions. To the state economy, small businesses are its lifeblood."
Today in Denver, Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states.
