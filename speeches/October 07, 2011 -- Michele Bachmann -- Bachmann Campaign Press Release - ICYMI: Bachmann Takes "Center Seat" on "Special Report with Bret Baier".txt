    Washington, D.C. – Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann appeared last night on Fox New Channel's "Special Report with Bret Baier" taking "Center Seat." Fielding questions from the show's All-Star panel – which included columnist and political commentator, Charles Krauthammer, Washington Post political correspondent, Dan Balz, and Weekly Standard columnist, Stephen Hayes – Bachmann addressed current U.S. policies both foreign and domestic. Bachmann stressed that this is not the year to settle on a moderate GOP candidate, it's time to stand behind the one candidate who has been consistent on social issues and has clear ideas on how to turn the economy around.
After the program, Bachmann continued the conversation with the panel online (http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report/index.html#/v/1204908199001/special-report-online-michele-bachmann/?playlist_id=86927M) discussing the 2012 GOP race
