"The Free Nationals are stoked to be performing at Monday's digital rally for Senator Sanders' bid for president," Kelsey Gonzalez of the Free Nationals said. "His progressive positions on universal health care, immigration and education make him the clear choice for us in the primaries. We're looking forward to supporting him tomorrow."
"There are so many of us that just want to find common ground with all living beings so that we can move forward together as a world to live in peace, good health, and equality. Bernie speaks and lives the truth and has worked his entire life fighting for truth and justice- bringing people together for the common good and that is why I believe he can help unite us now," said Jim James.
