    The Keene Sentinel by Terri Hansel
Nikki Haley offers a new generation of leadership, a different style and approach. She tackles tough issues in a way that brings people together. Nikki's dedication to the voters of the Granite State is astounding. Her most recent swing through the North Country brought Nikki's total stops on the campaign trail up to 41 and Nikki is making plans to come back again. Nikki held two town halls in both Barrington and Hollis last week alone. No other presidential candidate shows as much hard work and determination as Nikki Haley when it comes to her ground game in New Hampshire. Nikki is determined to meet, what it seems like, every Granite State voter.
