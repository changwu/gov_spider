"Even when the deck is stacked, a New Yorker will find a way to break up big banks, create millions of jobs and rebuild America," the narrator says over archival footage of the 32nd president.
During a visit on Tuesday to his historic Hudson River Valley home, Sanders said President Roosevelt "created a government that stands up for working people, the poor and the sick."
"Some say it can't be done again," the ad continues. "But another native son of New York is ready: Bernie. Rebuild the middle class, make Wall Street banks pay their fair share, give every child a chance."
"New York: it's our time again to build a future to believe in," the ad concludes.
