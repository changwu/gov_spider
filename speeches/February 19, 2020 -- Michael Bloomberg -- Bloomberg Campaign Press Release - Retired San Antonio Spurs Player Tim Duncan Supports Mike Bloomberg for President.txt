    In new ad, Duncan cites Bloomberg's work in the Virgin Islands after hurricanes as a reason for his support
ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS â€” Retired San Antonio Spurs player, Wake Forest University alumni, and Virgin Islands native Tim Duncan today announced his support for Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg in a new TV ad that highlights Bloomberg's work in the U.S. Virgin Islands after two deadly Category 5 hurricanes hit in 2017.
"I'm Tim Duncan, born and raised in the Virgin Islands," Duncan says in the ad, "and I'm supporting Mike Bloomberg for president because of his work in 2017 to help the U.S. Virgin Islands recover after we were hit by two Category 5 hurricanes."
The ad featuring Duncan will air beginning this week.
Duncan's endorsement comes after Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett announced her support earlier this month, citing Mike's commitment to addressing the country's most pressing infrastructure needs with safer and smarter solutions for the 21st century and his commitment to fighting on behalf of all Americans and getting things done.
The Bloomberg campaign is working to earn the support of Democratic primary voters across the U.S. Virgin Islands. Last month, the campaign announced they hired Jonathan Tucker, a U.S. Virgin Islands native, to serve as the campaign's state director and will open the campaign's first office this month. The organization's presence on the Islands showcases the campaign's unique strategy to engage voters in all corners of the country. Campaign staff have already shown their organizing strength with over 2,100 staff on the ground across the country, and they are working with Mike's supporters to defeat Donald Trump in November.
