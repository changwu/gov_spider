But the great majority of Americans who recognize we are not better off than we were four years ago recognize that his policies are not what is needed to get the middle class growing with more take-home pay and more jobs." â€“ Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Well, you know, incomplete usually means that you have got to go back and take the course again. I don't think the American people want to see this president get another four years. The last four years have not been good for the middle class in America. There is no question but that his policies have led to more people falling out of the middle class into poverty. More people in poverty. One out of six. A record number of people on food stamps. 47 million. This has not been a good time for the American people. Anyone that wants to let him try it again, I think would be making a big mistake. Those who think that they are better off than they were four years ago, they may decide to vote for him. But the great majority of Americans who recognize we are not better off than we were four years ago recognize that his policies are not what is needed to get the middle class growing with more take-home pay and more jobs."
