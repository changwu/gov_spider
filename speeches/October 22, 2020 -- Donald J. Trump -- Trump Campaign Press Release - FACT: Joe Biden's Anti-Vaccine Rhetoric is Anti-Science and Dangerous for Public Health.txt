    Biden continues to peddle anti-vax conspiracy theories and undermine the public's confidence in the coming coronavirus vaccine.
Despite overwhelming testimony from top public health officials that the coronavirus vaccine will be safe and effective, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are spreading fear, fueling anti-vax conspiracy theories, and actively trying to undermine the public's confidence in a vaccine.


July 28, 2020: Joe Biden suggests the coronavirus vaccine won't be "real" and may not be "safe."

August 6, 2020: Biden says the vaccine is "not likely to go through all the tests that needs to be and the trials that are needed to be done."

September 3, 2020: Biden asks "Who's going to take the shot? Are you going to be the first one to say sign me up?"

September 6, 2020: Kamala Harris says "I think that's going to be an issue" when asked if she would get an approved coronavirus vaccine.

September 7, 2020: Biden said he would take the coronavirus vaccine "only if we knew all of what went into it.

When CNN asked Kamala Harris if she would take the vaccine once it's approved, she refused to answer: "Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us. I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump."
Comments like these, directly contradicting public health officials, have endangered Americans' public health by severely undermining the public's confidence in the coronavirus vaccine.
