    I UNDERSTAND that you have been taking a look at the press of the United States. We are glad to have you in the country, and hope that you will get some satisfaction out of your visit.
There are a great many wonderful newspapers in this country, and I hope that you can get some good out of them; and I am sure you will.
When you go back to Germany, I hope you will be able to say that you have been cordially treated in this country, and that we at least showed that we were glad to have you pay us a visit.
Thank you very much.
