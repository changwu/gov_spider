    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement in response to the announcement by President Bush that he will nominate Michael Mukasey to the fill the office of attorney general:
"The Justice Department's reputation has been terribly tarnished by former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez and the Bush administration's disregard for the law and its partisan influence over law enforcement. Now more than ever, all Americans would agree that it's time for new leadership at the Justice Department.
"It may be that the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey turns a new page, but many questions still need to be asked and answered. I am hopeful that Judge Mukasey will commit to ensuring that the Justice Department remains independent of any further attempts at political manipulation by the Bush administration. Either way, as the confirmation hearings move forward, we need to hear more about how Judge Mukasey will repair the serious damage caused by his predecessors."
