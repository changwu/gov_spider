    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on Secretary Gates' comments regarding the Air Force tanker deal:
"Today, Secretary Gates announced decisive steps that the Defense Department will take to ensure that the program to replace the Air Force's aging tanker fleet is subjected to full and open competition. I support his decision to do so. The steps he announced reflect careful consideration of the GAO's decision and the need for continuing oversight of the process by which the Department decides to purchase its largest and most expensive weapons. I am hopeful that the Secretary's plan to buy new tankers will result in the timely fielding of this important capability for all the Services at the best value to the taxpayer."
