    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the enclosed study, findings, and report for the Squirrel River in Alaska. The report and my recommendations are submitted pursuant to my authority under Article II, section 3, of the Constitution of the United States, and consistent with section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSR) Act, Public Law 90- 542, as amended. The Squirrel River suitability study was authorized by Public Law 96-487 (Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act).
The study conducted by the Bureau of Land Management determined that all 100 miles of the river are nonsuitable for inclusion in the National WSR System. Consistent with the study, I recommend that the Congress take no action to designate the river. The withdrawal provided by section 5(a) of the WSR Act would expire within 3 years of the date of this message (unless other action is taken by the Congress). Approximately 81,501 acres of State-selected lands would be opened to mineral entry although mineral potential has been assessed as very low and there are no past or active mining claims.
