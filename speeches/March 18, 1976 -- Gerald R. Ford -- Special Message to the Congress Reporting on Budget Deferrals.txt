    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report six new deferrals. One of the deferrals--a routine one deferring Navy shipbuilding and conversion funds--accounts for all but $316.3 million of the $2,562.2 million associated with these six new deferrals. The other five affect funds for the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and Agriculture.
In addition, I am reporting an increase of $188,510 in a previously transmitted deferral of funds for a program of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
