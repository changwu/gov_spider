    Trade Promotion Authority
The President. It's my honor to host a discussion on trade and its advantages to our country. I want to thank the leaders of the House and the Senate in both parties for being here. We've got a lot of work to do in order to get trade promotion authority, but I'm confident that we can work together to do so. It's in our Nation's best interest that we trade. It's in the interest of those who provide jobs. It's in the interest of our farmers and ranchers. It's in the interest of small-business owners. And as I was reminded, it's in the interest of those of us who care about our values as to how to spread our values around the world.
This is an issue that is going to require close cooperation between members of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party. But that's achievable because trade is an American issue, and it's an important American issue.
So I look forward to working with the Members. I'm honored you all are here. Thank you for coming. And Ambassador Zoellick, who is the Trade Representative, is working hard on the Hill. And when you all get back from recess, we'll be working with you to see if we can advance the cause.
Thanks for coming.
U.S. Navy Aircraft Incident
Q. Any progress on the Chinese, Mr. President?
The President. Nothing more to report.
Q. Is it safe to assume they boarded the plane?
The President. Nothing more to report. Gregory [David Gregory, NBC News], give it a rest, will you? [Laughter]
