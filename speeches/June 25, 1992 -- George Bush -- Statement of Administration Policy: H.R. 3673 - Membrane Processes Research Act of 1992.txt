    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/26/92)(House)(Packard (R) California and 13 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3673. The bill would require the National Science Foundation to establish a program for research on water desalination techniques using membrane processes to treat contaminated water. The Department of the Interior is already funding such research, so a new program is not necessary.
