We can't lose sight of what this election is about. 
Beyond the theatrics, beyond the negative attacks, beyond the absurd stories from the media, this election is about defeating Hillary Clinton and securing the American dream.Check out Marco's closing message to Iowa caucus goers:


America is exceptional. Every generation before us met the great challenges of their time. But after seven long years of this president, we feel our country slipping away.
This election is about defeating Hillary Clinton and about saving what makes America unique.
I'm Marco Rubio. I approved this message and I am asking for your vote so we can leave our children what our parents left us: the single greatest nation in all mankind. 
We know that there is no candidate that Hillary Clinton fears more than Marco Rubio. 
Republican voters can show Hillary that they know it too â€” by casting their votes for Marco.
