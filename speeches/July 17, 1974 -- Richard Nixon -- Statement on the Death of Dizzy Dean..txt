    TO MY generation of Americans, Dizzy Dean will always be remembered as the blazing young fast-baller who led the Gashouse Gang of St. Louis to the pinnacle of baseball glory. To the young, Dizzy will also be remembered as the sportscaster who brought an extra touch of excitement and color to every game he covered. Dizzy Dean was indeed a man for all generations. And America is saddened today by his death.
Mrs. Nixon and I join sports fans everywhere in mourning the loss of this legendary figure.
