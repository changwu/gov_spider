    This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from experience that if they can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to commit a crime and return to prison.
In January, the President proposed a new prisoner re-entry initiative based on expanding job training and placement services, providing transitional housing, and helping newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of second chances, and when the prison gates open, the President believes that the path ahead should be an opportunity for a better life.
Today, Representatives Rob Portman (R-OH) and Danny Davis (D-IL) introduced the Second Chance Act 2004, which includes key elements of the President's prisoner re-entry initiative. The President strongly supports their efforts, and commends the Congressmen for their leadership. We urge the House and Senate to work in a bipartisan way to get legislation passed this year that is consistent with what the President outlined.
