    I'm about to kick off a big day of campaigning in Alabama, but didn't want to let any more time go by without thanking sisters Camille and Haley Harris, and their parents David & Cherri, for all of their hard work in writing, singing and producing their song "Game On." What a great anthem for our campaign -- I haven't been able to get the song out of my head! I feel so blessed to have such ardent supporters of our vision for America's future, and am grateful to the entire Harris family for their continued faith in our campaign.
You can view the video in its entirety below. And please share it with your friends and family, too â€” spread the word about our campaign, and share Camille & Haley's incredible talents with your loved ones.
