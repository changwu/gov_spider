    Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster exists for the Seminole Tribe of Florida and ordered Federal aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Ian beginning on September 23, 2022, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals of the Seminole Tribe of Florida and its associated lands.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to the Seminole Tribe of Florida and to certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the Seminole Tribe of Florida. For a period of 30 days from the start of the incident period, assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, is authorized at 100 percent of the total eligible costs.
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. McCool as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are fully completed.
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated areas can begin applying for assistance at www.DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the FEMA App. Anyone using a relay service, such as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can give FEMA the number for that service.
