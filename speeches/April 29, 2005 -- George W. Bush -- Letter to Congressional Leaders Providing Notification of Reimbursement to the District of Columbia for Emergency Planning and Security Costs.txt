    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Consistent with title I of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2005, Public Law 108-335, I am notifying the Congress of the proposed use of $2,471,588 provided in title I under the heading "Federal Payment for Emergency Planning and Security Costs in the District of Columbia." This will reimburse the District for the costs of public safety expenses related to security events and responses to terrorist threats.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
