  A Proclamation

Thirty-five years ago Americans were pitted in battle on a small, barren island called Iwo Jima. The standard of courage established by the men of the V Marine Amphibious Corps in that battle is unsurpassed.
Because we now enjoy the blessings of the freedom for which those men sacrificed so much, it is appropriate for us to reflect upon the high price of that freedom. For 35 days, men of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Marine Divisions fought to secure the strategic island of Iwo Jima. The cost of the eventual American victory was the highest in Marine Corps history: 5,931 dead and 17,272 wounded. Of the over 20,000 Japanese defenders on Iwo Jima, only 1,083 survived. But the victors and the vanquished alike shared uncommon valor as a common virtue.
The Congress has by Joint Resolution (H.J. Res. 469) designated February 19, 1980 as Iwo Jima Commemoration Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, February 19, 1980 as Iwo Jima Commemoration Day. I call on all Americans to join on this occasion in honoring those Americans who served on Iwo Jima. I call on State and local officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
