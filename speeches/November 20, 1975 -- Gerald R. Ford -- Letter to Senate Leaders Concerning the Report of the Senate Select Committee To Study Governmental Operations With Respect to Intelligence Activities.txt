    AS YOU will recall, I previously advised Members of the Senate Select Committee of my concern about publication of their Assassination Report. Attached is a copy of my October 31st letter.1
1 See Item 659.
It is my understanding that the Senate will, this morning, consider the question of publication of the Committee Report. The purpose of my writing is to indicate to you that my earlier position has not changed. For the reasons assigned previously, I do not feel this publication is in the national interest.
It is my hope that after reviewing the Report, the Senate will concur with that view and, therefore, not authorize this publication.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
