    "Vice President Mike Pence made clear tonight that President Trump is the clear choice to continue to rebuild the American economy,. Vice President Pence exposed Joe Biden's plan to raise taxes by $4 trillion, strangle the economy with Green New Deal regulations, ban fracking, abolish fossil fuels, and kill millions of jobs in the process. And Vice President Pence made clear that President Trump has stood up to China and protected American jobs, while Biden has spent decades rolling over for the communist Chinese. Vice President Pence eviscerated Biden's record on foreign policy and his willingness to coddle terrorists and state sponsors of terror. Senator Harris is the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate and it showed, as she continued to push Joe Biden to the left. President Trump built the world's best economy once and is already doing it a second time. And as Vice President Pence made clear, President Trump has accomplished more in 47 months than Biden has in 47 years."
