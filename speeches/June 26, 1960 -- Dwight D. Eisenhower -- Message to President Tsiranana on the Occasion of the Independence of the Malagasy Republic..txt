Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of the independence of the Malagasy Republic, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the people of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and your countrymen.
The independence of the Malagasy Republic achieved in friendly cooperation with France is a source of deep satisfaction to the United States. The Government and people of Madagascar and of France in their efforts to achieve social and economic advancement in Madagascar through democratic means have earned the admiration of all free nations.
On this historic occasion the Government and the people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Malagasy Republic.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
