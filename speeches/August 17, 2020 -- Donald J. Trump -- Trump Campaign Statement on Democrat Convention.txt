    "Perhaps it was just an oversight, but the first night of the Democrat convention left out the fact that Joe Biden would raise taxes on more than 80 percent of Americans by at least $4 trillion. Also missing was his open borders policy, with amnesty and work permits for 11 million illegal aliens. There was no mention of Joe Biden's desire to cut police funding, kill ten million energy jobs with a green new deal, or give free healthcare to illegal aliens, but in fairness, it was only the first night. Biden also failed to highlight his opposition to President Trump's decision to restrict travel from China and Europe, which saved countless American lives. With history as our guide, if Joe Biden had been president, the coronavirus crisis would be dramatically worse. Democrats can try to conceal the dangerous truth with a Hollywood-produced infomercial, but they can't hide the fact that the radical socialist leftist takeover of Joe Biden is complete."
