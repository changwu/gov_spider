    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Glenn (D) OH and 51 others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of S. 135. If this bill were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend its disapproval.
S. 135 repeals virtually all of the Hatch Act's restrictions on partisan political activity by Federal employees. This bill would allow unrestricted, off-duty partisan electioneering and political activity by all Federal employees. Such activity would undermine the integrity and independence of the traditionally non-partisan civil service.
Under S. 135, Federal employees would be vulnerable to both direct and subtle political pressures. They could be pressed to "volunteer" help in campaigns and to make financial contributions in order to curry favor with one political party or another. The bill's proposed safeguards against abuse are inadequate and largely unenforceable.
The Administration believes the Hatch Act, which has served to protect the public interest for half a century, is a valuable safeguard of governmental integrity and should be preserved.
