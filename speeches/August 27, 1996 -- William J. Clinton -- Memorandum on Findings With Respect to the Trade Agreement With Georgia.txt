    Presidential Determination No. 96-49
Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Findings With Respect to the Trade Agreement With Georgia
Pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I have determined that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are satisfactorily reciprocated by Georgia. I have further found that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement on Trade Relations between the United States of America and Georgia.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, August 27, 1996.
