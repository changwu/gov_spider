    I am deeply gratified that the Senate has approved Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke's nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. I am grateful to Ambassador Holbrooke for his commitment to public service and especially for his willingness to persevere through the confirmation process.
Vice President Gore, Secretary Albright, and I welcome him back to our foreign policy team. With the U.N. facing significant challenges in Kosovo, Iraq, Africa, and elsewhere, Ambassador Holbrooke is the right person to lead our efforts at the U.N. He will play a key role in working with the Congress to meet our obligations and to secure needed reforms at the United Nations.
Since he joined the Foreign Service 37 years ago, Ambassador Holbrooke has served our Nation with distinction in Asia, Africa, and Europe. I am confident that he will represent the United States with dedication.
