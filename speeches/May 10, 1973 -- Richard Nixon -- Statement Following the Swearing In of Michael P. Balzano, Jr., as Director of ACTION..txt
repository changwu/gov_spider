    AS THE new Director of ACTION takes office today, I am pleased to reaffirm the commitment of this Administration to America's volunteer programs both at home and abroad.
One of the greatest potential forces for solving contemporary social problems is voluntarism--the helping hand that each of us can give to those in need. Two years ago, in order to tap that resource more effectively, we brought a number of federally sponsored volunteer programs under one roof, ACTION.
Today there are some 48,000 volunteers who participate in the activities of this agency. Many of them are involved with programs begun earlier and continued by this Administration; others participate in new programs which we have launched over the past 4 years.
I am confident that the ACTION agency will continue to write exciting new chapters in the history of voluntarism in America. I hope the American people will join me in giving this important work our strong support.
