NEW VIDEO: Is Bernie Sanders About To Run Negative Attack Ads?
After touting his positive campaign repeatedly on the trail, the New York Times this morning reported that the Sanders campaign is now publicly weighing the option to "directly attack" on Hillary Clinton on the airwaves – in violation of Senator Sanders' repeated pledge never to run a negative TV ad.
While this is a clear escalation, attacks from the Sanders campaign have been building for months. Just today, the Wall Street Journal wrote about how Bernie Sanders is using his stump speech to attack Secretary Clinton's character. Last year, after a reporter called to question it, the Sanders campaign was forced to take down a negative online ad when Sanders himself admitted it crossed the line in attacking Secretary Clinton.
And this month, the Sanders campaign faced criticism for running a TV ad that was an implicit attack on Hillary Clinton.

MSNBC: "[Sanders is] broadcasting a paid TV ad with that message is a major escalation, and a potentially risky one for a candidate who has vowed not to go negative."

As the Iowa caucus has drawn nearer, Sanders has even taken to making personal attacks on Clinton. And now, under pressure with just five days left until the contest, the campaign is going public with active discussions about launching "direct" attacks against Hillary Clinton on TV—and the Clinton campaign has released a new video highlighting the difference between Senator Sanders' previous claims and his recent attacks.

"It's disappointing that Senator Sanders has abandoned his claims of a positive campaign in order to parrot Karl Rove's attacks against Hillary Clinton. From comparisons to Dick Cheney to personal attacks, Bernie Sanders and his campaign have repeatedly violated their pledge to run a different kind of campaign," said Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, September 2015: "I happen to have known – know Hillary Clinton for the last 25 years. I respect her. I admire her. I'm not going to get into the business of attacking her. I have never run a negative political ad in my life."
Sanders advisor Tad Devine, November 2015: "This campaign is never going to be about attacking her, and pushing back on her and diminishing her."
