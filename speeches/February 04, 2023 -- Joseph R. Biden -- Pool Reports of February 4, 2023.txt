We arrived at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base at 2:05. POTUS exited The Beast. Pool shouted are you going to shoot down the balloon? Biden smiled and gave a thumbs up to reporters. Pool also asked Did you issue a directive to shoot down the balloon? And what message this sends to China.

Travel pool report #7 Hagerstown arrival BIDEN Comments
AF1 landed at Hagerstown Regional Airport at 3:06 PM. Biden stepped off at 3:15 PM and spoke to reporters. Sending in two parts for speed.
"On Wednesday when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible."
He said they didn't want to do damage to anyone on the ground. "They decided that the best time to do that was when it got over water [inaudible] within 12 mile limit."
"They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators that did it," Biden said.
More to come.

Travel pool report #8 Biden remarks part 2
Part 2 on Biden remarks
Your pooler asked POTUS to elaborate on his decision and the recommendation from his national security officials.
"I told them to shoot it down," Biden said, referring to his directive to national security officials.
Q: On Wednesday?
POTUS: "On Wednesday."
A: But the recommendation to them was to waitâ€”
POTUS: "They said to me let's wait to the safest place to do it."
Multiple reporters asked what message this sends to China. POTUS looked at one of those reporters who asked but ignored him and walked to the Beast.
