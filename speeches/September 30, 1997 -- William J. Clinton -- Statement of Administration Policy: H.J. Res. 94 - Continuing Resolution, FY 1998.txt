    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)
(Sponsor: Livingston (R), Louisiana)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.J. Res. 94, the Continuing Resolution, FY 1998. Your consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.
On May 2, 1997, the President and the congressional leadership reached agreement on an historic Bipartisan Budget Agreement that balances the budget while honoring our values. Over the following months, the Administration worked closely with the congressional leadership to enact that Agreement. On August 5, 1997, the President was proud to sign two key elements of the Agreement, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997. As the current fiscal year comes to a close, it is essential that we work together to enact the third element of the Agreement, the appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998.
The Administration urges the Congress to approve FY 1998 spending bills that include those items contained in the Agreement and to provide funding for other priority programs.
In order to facilitate the adoption of such bills, the Administration supports prompt passage of H.J. Res. 94, the Continuing Resolution, FY 1998, in its current form.
