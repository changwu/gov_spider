    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Kline (R) MN and 22 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1412, the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. The bill would provide the Secretary of Education with temporary authority to waive specific provisions applicable to the student financial assistance programs to extend relief to students and borrowers serving on active military duty or certain individuals otherwise adversely affected by a war or other military operation or national emergency.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
The provisions of the bill would grant the Secretary new authorities which if exercised may result in an increase in mandatory spending. An official cost estimate is still under development. The Budget Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go requirements and discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002. The Administration supports the extension of these budget enforcement mechanisms in a manner that ensures fiscal discipline and is consistent with the President's budget.
