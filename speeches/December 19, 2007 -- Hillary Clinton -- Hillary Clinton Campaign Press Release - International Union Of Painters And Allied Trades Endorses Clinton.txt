    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. The IUPAT represents more than 160,000 members and retirees in the finishing trades.
"Our members have spoken and they have overwhelmingly chosen Senator Clinton as the IUPAT candidate for president," said IUPAT General President James Williams. "They told us that they want retirement security, health care reform and a leader in the White House who can deliver the change this country needs. Senator Clinton, the members of the Painters and Allied Trades believe in you, and we're ready to help you win in 2008."
Williams said the IUPAT undertook the most extensive polling of its members and retirees ever conducted, mailing out ballots to every member nationwide, with Hillary the overwhelming winner.
"I am honored to have the support of the hard working men and women of the IUPAT," Clinton said. "Together, we will ensure that America's working families are no longer invisible to the President of the United States."
Hillary has been endorsed by more than a dozen unions representing 6 million working families nationwide, including: Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Transportation Communications Union; National Association of Letter Carriers; International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers; American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers; Amalgamated Transit Union; Office and Professional Employees International Union; and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts.
