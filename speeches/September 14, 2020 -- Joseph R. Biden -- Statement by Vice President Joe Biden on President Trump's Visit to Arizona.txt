    President Trump intentionally misled Americans about the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, he still doesn't have a plan to contain it, and Arizonans are paying the price. People from all walks of life are suffering under his failed leadership — from the small business owners trying to keep their doors open and their employees on payroll to the parents who are struggling with a difficult and chaotic start to the school year — and Arizona's Latinos are bearing a disproportionate burden. President Trump has failed to deliver Arizonans the kind of leadership they need, especially during this crisis. My Administration will lead us out of this pandemic and build our nation back better, while safeguarding protections for as many as 2.8 million Arizonans who have a preexisting condition. Families across Arizona are hurting and deserve a President who will fight for them, not his own self-interest.
