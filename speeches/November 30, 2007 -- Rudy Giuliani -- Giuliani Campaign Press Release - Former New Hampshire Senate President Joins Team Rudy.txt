    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Arthur Klemm Jr., who served as President of the New Hampshire State Senate, has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. Klemm represented Windham and surrounding towns for 14 years in the New Hampshire Senate and House.
"America needs the type of leadership that only Rudy Giuliani can give us," said Klemm. "We all saw how he restored hope and optimism to the people of New York during challenging times for the City. Rudy is someone who confronts difficult problems and finds effective solutions. He is a strong leader who will use New Hampshire-style conservative principles to move our country forward."
"Senator Klemm joins a growing group of current and former New Hampshire legislative leaders who are backing Rudy. His support provides further evidence that the Mayor's optimistic vision for our country is resonating in the Granite State. It is an honor to have Senator Klemm's support as we move closer to Primary day," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman.
