    President Obama congratulates President Traian Basescu of Romania on his re-election, which the Romanian Constitutional Court certified yesterday. Under President Basescu’s leadership, Romania has joined the European Union and NATO and has become a key ally of the United States. Americans stand with Romanians in Europe and around the world, including our common ISAF mission in Afghanistan. The United States looks forward to continuing its close cooperation with President Basescu, as well as with Romania’s government and parliamentary leaders, in the months and years to come.
