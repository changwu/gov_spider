HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Ted Cruz continued building a strong, national organization by announcing his Maine leadership team, consisting of some of the state's top conservatives. Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason and former Representative Earl Bierman will serve as Maine chairs for Cruz.
"I am encouraged to announce such an outstanding group of courageous conservatives leading our campaign in Maine," said Cruz. "All across this country, we are gaining momentum by coalescing conservatives who are ready for a president that answers to them and not the Washington establishment. I am proud of the team we have put together in Maine and confident that we are positioned to compete for every vote on caucus night."
"We need a strong, principled conservative in the White House," said Mason. "I am thrilled to endorse Ted Cruz because I believe he is that man. Ted has demonstrated himself to be a trusted conservative voice in the U.S. Senate and we need that same leadership in our next President."
"Throughout Maine, conservatives are uniting behind Ted Cruz," said Bierman. "After the victory in Iowa, it is becoming clear that more and more Republicans are demanding that we choose a Republican nominee who will stay true to our conservative values and the Constitution. Mainers are ready for a president who will defend the Constitution, uphold the rule of law, and honor their word to the American people."
