    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2904, the "Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2002," which provides $10.5 billion for military construction and family housing programs administered by the Department of Defense.
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The Act abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and funds the vast majority of my request for military construction projects, the military housing program, and other projects for our military personnel and their families. The requested projects are critical to supporting military readiness and the quality of life for our soldiers. My Administration showed its commitment to improving the quality of housing available to our military personnel and their families by including an additional $400 million in the FY 2002 Budget. I want to thank the Congress for including it in this bill. However, I am disappointed that the bill includes a 1.127 percent general reduction, and a rescission of $55 million from the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
As America battles terrorism, we must ensure that our men and women in uniform live in, train at, and deploy from adequate facilities. This bill shows our commitment to our service members by constructing and upgrading military installations, and military family housing in the United States and overseas.
My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Now, through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and my Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.
