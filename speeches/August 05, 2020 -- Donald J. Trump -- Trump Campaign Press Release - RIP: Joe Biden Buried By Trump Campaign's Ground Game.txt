    Biden lags in voter outreach and enthusiasm. 
President Trump is outworking Joe Biden and it shows. The Trump Victory Team is already double the size it was for the president's historic 2016 victory. Nationwide, the operation boasts more than 1,500 staff, over 1.8 million volunteers and more than 70 million volunteer voter contacts.
The Biden campaign can't compete with the Trump campaign's voter outreach operation, and to top it off, their candidate is hiding in his basement. Bookmark these headlines for November 3rd:

Biden's less than lackluster ground game isn't his only problem. He's badly trailing the president in another key factor: enthusiasm. While Biden struggles to attract viewers to his basement live streams, President Trump's supporters line the streets just to "catch a glimpse" of him and organize boat parades to show their support.
The president's supporters are 70% more enthusiastic than Biden's, and the enthusiasm gap is only widening as excitement about Biden falls among key voter groups. Can you blame them? Biden can't even remember whether or not he's taken a cognitive testâ€¦ Of course Hiden Biden would rather stay in his basement than face reality.
