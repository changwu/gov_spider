In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 27th ultimo, requesting the President to inform the Senate "whether any increase or, improvement of organization is needed in the Ordnance Corps," I have to state that I entertain no doubt of the propriety of increasing the corps, and that I concur in the plan proposed for this purpose in the accompanying report from the Secretary of War.
