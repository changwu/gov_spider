    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Mackay (D) Fla. and 54 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2436, because:
— the purposes of the bill are being accomplished under existing law by the National Nutrition Monitoring System, managed jointly by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services;
— the additional Federal expenditures heeded for new grant programs, an interagency board, an advisory council, expanded data collection, and new reporting requirements are unwarranted; and— the bill's management structure and reporting requirements are unnecessarily complex and burdensome, and would probably delay the Departments' meeting their monitoring goals.
