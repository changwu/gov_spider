    U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) issued the following statement regarding the Missouri caucuses today:
"As I saw once again today during the caucuses in Clayton and Bonhomme, there is enthusiastic support in Missouri for Governor Romney's pro-growth agenda to jumpstart job creation across America. Families and job creators in our state are looking for a leader who will create more certainty, rein in out-of-control spending, and reduce the size of government in Washington. Thanks to his experience as governor and in the private sector, Mitt Romney continues to garner strong support in Missouri and nationwide because he's the best candidate to get our economy back on track."
