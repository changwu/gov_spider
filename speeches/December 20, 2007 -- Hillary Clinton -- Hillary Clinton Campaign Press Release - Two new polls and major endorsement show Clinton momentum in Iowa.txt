    CNN, ARG polls have Hillary leading close race in the Hawkeye State, one day after Secretary of State Mauro endorses Clinton.
DES MOINES, IA - Last night's endorsement by Secretary of State Michael Mauro, and two new independent polls released this morning confirm that Hillary Clinton has momentum going into the final two weeks of a very close Iowa campaign.
A CNN/Opinion Research poll (www.politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com) conducted December 14-18 shows Hillary leading the field with 30 percent, followed by 28 percent for Senator Obama and 26 percent for Senator Edwards. Furthermore, she is seen by Democratic caucus-goers as the candidate best able to handle Iraq, the economy, and health care - the top three issues of concern.
An American Research Group poll (www.americanresearchgroup.com) conducted December 16-19 shows Hillary with 29 percent, followed by Senator Obama at 25 percent and Senator Edwards at 18%. This is a six point swing from last month when Senator Obama led the field by two points. Clinton also has a 13-point lead among women (36-23-18).
The polls and Mauro endorsement come on the heels of a week that has shown great momentum for the Clinton campaign. In the last week, Hillary was endorsed by the Des Moines Register, Congressman Leonard Boswell, and former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey. Clinton will also wrap up her campaign's five-day blitz of all 99 counties today when she ends her "Every County Counts" tour at a stop in Burlington.
