    Thank you very, very much, Mr. Schwarz. Let me thank you very much for giving me the privilege and opportunity of serving as the honorary chairman of the Big Brothers program. I have known about the Big Brothers program for a number of years. It started, as I understand it, back in 1903, and it has had a superb record over the years in giving recognition to big brothers who help little brothers.
With that comment, I want to congratulate Herb Buchanan for being the Big Brother of the Year, and I also want to express to Rick Proctor here my appreciation for the wonderful job he has done in being the Little Brother of the Year. My very best to you.
As we look around this country and see the tremendous job that is being done by the Big Brothers organization--men who have taken the responsibility of fatherless boys and given them an opportunity and a blessing that only can come from a father--I think people like Herb Buchanan here and others deserve a great deal of Credit.
I know that Rick understands how meaningful it has been to him and to literally thousands of others to have an opportunity for the guidance and the help and assistance of somebody like Herb Buchanan.
There is no question, Rick, that as you grow older and assume your position and responsibilities in our life in this country, you can look back on this experience with Herb and Mrs. Buchanan, who I suspect has had some impact, that you will be a much finer citizen than you would have been if you had not had exposure to the Big Brothers. So, good luck to you.
Herb, thank you for doing a fine job.
