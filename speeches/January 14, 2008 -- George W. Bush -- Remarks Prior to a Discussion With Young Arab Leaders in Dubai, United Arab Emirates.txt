First of all, just a couple of impressions: I'm most impressed with what I've seen here. The entrepreneurial spirit is strong and, equally importantly, the desire to make sure that all aspects of society are—have hope and encouragement. And I appreciate your leadership, Your Highness.
And I want to thank you, sir, for having me. I'm looking forward to talking to the young leaders from around the region. I am going to answer your questions. And I also want you to understand something about America: that we respect you, we respect your religion, and we want to work together for the sake of freedom and peace.
And I thank—I'm particularly pleased to know that you have set up interchanges with some of the young in my country. You'll find them to be compassionate, decent people who share the same goals and dreams. And so I want to thank you for coming.
Your Highness, I'm so honored by your hospitality.
