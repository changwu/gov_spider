    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and two developing countries. The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act"), 19 U.S.C. 2461, et seq.
First, I intend to add Czechoslovakia to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences. After examining the criteria specified in Sections 501, 502 (b) and (c), and 504(f) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, I have determined it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Czechoslovakia.
I also intend to suspend indefinitely Sudan from its status as a GSP beneficiary for failure to comply with section 502(b)(7) of the 1974 Act concerning internationally recognized worker rights. This decision will take place at least 60 days from the date of this letter.
Sincerely,
George Bush
