    President Obama spoke today by phone with President Francois Hollande of France to offer his heartfelt condolences on behalf of the American people to the people of France on yesterday's horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France. The President noted that this terrible attack was particularly heinous given that it struck revelers celebrating Bastille Day. The President offered to President Hollande any assistance the French may require in their efforts to investigate and recover from this tragic loss of life. The President thanked President Hollande for France's unwavering support to the Counter-ISIL Coalition and in the broader global fight to confront all terrorism, and he reaffirmed the strong and ongoing partnership of the United States with France, our oldest ally.
