On his message to Iowa voters:
"I'm going to let people know what drives me as a leader; how are we able to achieve so much? What would that look like as president? I mean, I think we all know the country is off-kilter. Yes, Biden is leading this and, in some respects, but he's really a symptom of a lot of the underlying problems. When you go in there as a new president, and you're standing for the right things, you better be prepared: the blowback from the media, from the left from the bureaucracy, all across the board, if you're standing for what's right, in this day and age, you are going to face a lot of blowback. I think what I've been able to do as governor - whether it's COVID, whether it's standing up for the innocence of our children, and on down the line - is stand into that breach, stand for people's rights and freedoms, and stand for what's right, and not give an inch to these people. I don't know that we've had somebody that's successfully has been able to navigate all those hurdles in recent years, and I'll be able to get that done."
On Iowa's strong legislature and governor:
"I want to just let everyone up there know how much I respect what your governor and the legislature have done with passing the heartbeat bill. That was a big victory for life. Also, what they've been able to do to put up really big wins, similar to what we've done in Florida, and you're lucky to have a great governor like Kim Reynolds. I think she's actually going to be signing the bill at The Family Leader Summit, which is, which is really, really good."
