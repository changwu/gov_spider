    President Obama. Well, the--I just want to extend my congratulations to Prime Minister Yinglak for her leadership. Obviously, she had an inspirational election. She's now been dealing with an extraordinary tragedy, the flooding that's been taking place in Thailand. I called her and extended our condolences, but also our assurances that we would provide any assistance that we can in dealing with this natural disaster.
The United States and Thailand are two of the oldest of allies. We have established a great friendship over the years. We have a wide range of areas of common interest and cooperation. And I'm confident that under the Prime Minister's leadership we will continue to build on that relationship for many years to come.
So we look forward to speaking with her on a whole range of bilateral and multilateral issues. And, Madam Prime Minister, please extend our heartfelt condolences to those who have lost loved ones in the floods, and know that you have a strong friend in the United States.
Prime Minister Yinglak. Yes. First of all, I think, from--on behalf of Thai Government and Thai people, have to really appreciate for the condolence from U.S. and all the support from U.S. to give as a heartfelt to Thailand. And also, from the--our dialogue from Mr. President and the visiting of the Secretary Clinton to Thailand, that's really impact to Thailand to have the better relationship between Thailand and U.S.
And thank you again and--our congratulations for the success in APEC. But for me, very regret that I missed this great opportunity. Hopefully, I can go to U.S. in some days.
President Obama. Well, you definitely want to visit Hawaii whenever you get a chance. [Laughter]
Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody.
Prime Minister Yinglak. Thank you.
