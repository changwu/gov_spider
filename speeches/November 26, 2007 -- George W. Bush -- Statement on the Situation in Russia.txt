    I am deeply concerned about the detention of numerous human rights activists and political leaders who participated in peaceful rallies in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Nazran this weekend. I am particularly troubled by the use of force by law enforcement authorities to stop these peaceful activities and to prevent some journalists and human rights activists from covering them.
The freedoms of expression, assembly, and press, as well as due process, are fundamental to any democratic society. I am hopeful that the Government of Russia will honor its international obligations in these areas, investigate allegations of abuses, and free those who remain in detention.
