    The President today appointed 17 men and women from a variety of backgrounds and across the country to be the 1993-94 class of White House fellows.
White House fellows are a select group of men and women who spend a year early in their career serving as paid assistants to the President, Vice President, or Cabinet-level officials. This class will begin their fellowship year in September. They were selected by a commission appointed earlier this month by the President. It was chaired by Nancy Bekavac, the president of Scripps College.
"This is a group of people of exceptional abilities, strong motivation, and a commitment to serve their country," said the President. "I look forward to their service and am confident they will join the successful ranks of such White House fellowship alumni as General Colin Powell and Secretary Henry Cisneros."
