    AUSTIN - Texas Gov. Rick Perry today received the personal endorsement of Florida National Committeeman Paul Senft in his campaign for president.
"I'm proud to endorse Gov. Perry for president â€” he has been leading Texas to more job creation, while President Obama has failed to lead on anything," said Senft. "Gov. Perry's proven record of job creation is the best of any candidate in the field, and as a man of faith he is the strong, principled leader this party and our nation need. He will be an excellent Commander-in-Chief and respect the 10th Amendment to make Washington less intrusive in state government and less consequential in our daily lives so that our country can thrive and prosper as we rebuild our global pride and respect."
Paul Senft is a long time GOP activist from Haines City in Polk County and has served as Florida's National Committeeman since 2004. He is also an RNC Executive Committee Member, and previously served as the State Committeeman and Chairman for the Polk County Republican Executive Committee.
"Paul Senft has been a powerful force in advancing the values and priorities of the Republican Party in Florida, and I am honored to have his endorsement," said Gov. Rick Perry. "I look forward to his partnership in this campaign as I travel the nation sharing my vision to restore our economy and get America working again."
