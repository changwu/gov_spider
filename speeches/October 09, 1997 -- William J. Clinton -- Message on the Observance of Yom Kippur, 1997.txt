    Warm greetings to all those observing Yom Kippur.
On this most solemn of Jewish holy days, Jews across America and around the world acknowledge the transgressions of the past year and come before God to atone for their sins. It is a time to rectify mistakes, to repair broken bonds between family members, friends, and neighbors, and to reaffirm their sacred covenant with God. Rich with tradition and ritual, observed with strict fasting and devout prayer, the Day of Atonement offers the Jewish people a powerful reminder to begin the new year by seeking what is most important: the mercy of God and the forgiveness of those whom they may have failed.
As our nation embarks upon a season of renewal and reconciliation, Americans of all faiths can learn from the lessons of Yom Kippur. By acknowledging the divisions among us and seeking forgiveness from one another for past injuries and mistakes, we can strengthen our families, communities, and nation and enter the future as a more compassionate and united people.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a blessed Yom Kippur.
