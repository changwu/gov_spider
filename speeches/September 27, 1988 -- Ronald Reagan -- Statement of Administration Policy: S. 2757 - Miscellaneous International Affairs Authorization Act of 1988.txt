    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised - LA)
(Senate)(Pell (D) Rhode Island)
The Administration supports Titles I and II of S. 2757, relating to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Board for International Broadcasting, but objects to the remaining titles. If S. 2757 is presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto it because Title V of the bill would unconstitutionally:

—     interfere with the exercise of the President's authority to faithfully execute Federal criminal laws;
—     infringe upon the protections afforded internal Executive branch deliberations; and
—     restrict the President's authority to receive ambassadors and other public ministers. 
The bill also is objectionable because it would:

—     extend the ill-advised Congressional policy that lowers the standards regulating movement of aliens across U.S. borders by making permanent the temporary prohibition against refusing permission to enter the U.S. based upon the alien applicant's past, current or expected statements, beliefs or associations; and
—     authorize a 45-hour workweek under an Au Pair program, which undermines the integrity of cultural exchange visas and opens a loophole for future requests for exceptions to U.S. laws governing work in the U.S. by aliens.
