    Las Vegas, Nevada â€” Today, 35 Nevada educators announced their endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States. Teachers, administrations, and current and former elected officials from across the State of Nevada cited Joe Biden's long-standing commitment to education issues, as well as his policy visions laid out for improving K-12 and higher education in their endorsement.
This announcement comes following Dr. Jill Biden's visit to Nevada, where she spoke at the NEA LGBTQ+ Educational Issues Conference and attended several education-oriented community events in both Las Vegas and Reno. Dr. Biden made history as the first Second Lady to continue her career while her husband served as Vice President. She continues to teach English at Northern Virginia Community College while out on the campaign trail.
"I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for President and be one of the many Educators for Biden here in Nevada," says former Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education Daniel Klaich. "I support Joe Biden for President because he is committed to moral leadership. As both Senator and Vice President, he has always led with his heart. This ability is critical in addressing both the challenges and opportunities we have in our education system - as educators, we must take into account the fundamental, human impact of our work. Joe Biden gets that. That's why Joe understands the value of making quality education accessible to everyone, investing in our community college system, and nominating a public school teacher to Secretary of Education. As President, I know that he will prioritize the issues that impact our education system both here in Nevada and nationwide."
"Throughout his career in public service, Joe Biden has remained focused on improving our education system by supporting educators and the students they teach, says Former President of the Nevada State Education Association Ruben Murillo. "Joe offers a vision and plan that speaks to the issues impacting our education system today. He also understands how critical it is that we roll back the harmful policies that have been put into place by Betsy DeVos and the current administration. As President, Joe will address the challenges and opportunities that our education system faces today."
Mitzi Bender, a music teacher in the Clark County School District who commutes over an hour each way to get to school, also announced her support, stating, "Joe Biden has been a lifelong advocate for teachers and students alike. He understands that when we lift up our teachers, we lift up our communities and our future. Joe Biden's comprehensive education plan for teachers does just that, by addressing everything from increasing teacher pay to providing increased funding for Title I schools."
Bender, Murillo, and Klaich will all serve on the National Leadership of Educators for Biden, and lend their expertise to the campaign on issues related to education.
