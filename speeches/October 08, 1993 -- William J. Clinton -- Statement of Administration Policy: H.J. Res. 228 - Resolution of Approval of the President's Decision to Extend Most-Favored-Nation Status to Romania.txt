    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gephardt (D) Missouri and Michel (R) Illinois)
The Administration supports enactment of H.J. Res. 228.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.J. Res. 228 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that this resolution is revenue neutral.
