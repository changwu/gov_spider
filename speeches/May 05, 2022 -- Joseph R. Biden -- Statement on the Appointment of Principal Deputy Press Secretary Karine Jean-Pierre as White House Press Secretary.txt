    I am proud to announce that Karine Jean-Pierre will serve as the next White House Press Secretary.
Karine not only brings the experience, talent, and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of the American people. Jill and I have known and respected Karine a long time, and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this administration.
Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect, and decorum to the White House Briefing Room. I want to say thank you to Jen for raising the bar, communicating directly and truthfully to the American people, and keeping her sense of humor while doing so. I thank Jen her service to the country and wish her the very best as she moves forward.
