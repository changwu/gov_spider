    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lowry (D) Washington and 3 others)
The administration would support enactment of H.R. 2598, which would impose requirements with respect to commercial fishing vessels, if it were amended to delete the provision making vessels owned by corporations with less than 51 percent American individual citizen ownership ineligible for American registry. The American economy has realized significant benefits from foreign investment. The administration, therefore, urges that H.R. 2598 not be considered under suspension of the rules and that it be amended accordingly.
