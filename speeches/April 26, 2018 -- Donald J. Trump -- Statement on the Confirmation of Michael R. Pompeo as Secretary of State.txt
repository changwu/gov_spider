    I am pleased with the Senate's confirmation of Mike Pompeo to serve as our country's top diplomat. Having a patriot of Mike's immense talent, energy, and intellect leading the Department of State will be an incredible asset for our country at this critical time in history. He will always put the interests of America first. He has my trust. He has my support. Today he has my congratulations on becoming America's 70th Secretary of State.
