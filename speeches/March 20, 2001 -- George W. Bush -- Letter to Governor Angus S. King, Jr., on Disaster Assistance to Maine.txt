    Dear Governor King:
As requested, I have declared an emergency under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 USC 5121 (Stafford Act), for the State of Maine due to the emergency conditions resulting from record/near record snow on March 5-7, 2001. I have authorized Federal relief and recovery assistance in the affected area.
Emergency protective measures (Category B) under the Public Assistance program to save lives, protect public health and safety, and property will be provided. This emergency assistance will be provided for a period of 48 hours. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs in the designated areas.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate Federal assistance efforts and designate specific areas eligible for such assistance. The Federal Coordinating Officer will be Mr. David Rodham of FEMA. He will consult with you and assist in the execution of the FEMA-State Disaster Assistance Agreement governing the expenditure of Federal funds.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
