Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Romney announced the California Business and Technology Leaders for Romney Team. These influential members of the business community will assist and advise Governor Romney on policies that will help strengthen our economy, expand business opportunities and increase job growth across the state and nation.
In announcing the coalition, Governor Romney said, "There are new challenges facing our nation's economy, and we need a better environment for businesses to prosper and create new jobs. By enacting both a short-term and long-term stimulus to the economy, we can grow opportunities across California and the rest of the country. I look forward to working with these business leaders from across the state join me in discussing the potential for a brighter economic future in California and across the country."
"Our country needs a leader who understands how the economy works and how jobs are created, and that leader is Governor Romney," said California Business and Technology Coalition Member Papa Doug Manchester. "Governor Romney spent over 25 years in the private sector creating jobs and helping to grow the economy, only to then turnaround the 2002 Olympics and close a $3 billion budget gap as Governor. We believe he is the leader we need to bring real conservative change to Washington and strengthen economic opportunities across the country."
