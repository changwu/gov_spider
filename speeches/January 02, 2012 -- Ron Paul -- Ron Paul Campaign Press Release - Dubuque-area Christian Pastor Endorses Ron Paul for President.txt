ANKENY, Iowa - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul received today the endorsement of  the Rev. Mike Demory, Pastor of Heartland Church of Christ in Dubuque.
In making his endorsement Rev. Demory mentioned he was doing so as a private citizen and not on behalf of Heartland Church of Christ, or its congregants.
"As a Texas patriot who helped elect Dr. Paul to Congress, I have kept up with his career over the years and am proud to see him grow to the constitutional conservative we see today. I have waited almost 30 years for the American people to wake up to what our politicians and special interests have done to our great nation, and I now can thank President Barack Obama for a 'change' in the American people's thinking. Dr. Paul is the type of man our country needs in the White House, which is why I am throwing my support behind him," said Rev. Demory.
Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers responded positively to the announcement saying, "The Iowa team is pleased to accept Rev. Demory's endorsement, and delighted to hear that there is a connection with Iowa and Texas. Rev. Demory's endorsement and others like it will bring us closer to a strong top-three finish in tomorrow's caucus."
If ministering in Iowa, local pastors interested in discussing an endorsement are invited to email the Iowa Director of Voter Outreach, Meghann Walker, at meghannw@ronpaul2012.com.
