    In 1943, a supermarket worker in Dallas named Lucy Coffey left behind her home and her job to answer her country's call. In her 2 years with the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, Sergeant Coffey served throughout the Pacific theater with distinction, earning two Bronze Stars. After the war, Sergeant Coffey continued to serve her country as an Army civilian, and the example set by her and her fellow WACs has inspired generations of patriots since.
When Vice President Biden and I had the honor of meeting Sergeant Coffey at the White House last year, she was America's oldest living woman veteran, and it was clear that the passage of time never dampened her patriotic love of country or her pioneering spirit. As we remember her life and salute her service, our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones today.
