    This afternoon, President Obama called Green Bay Packers Head Coach Mike McCarthy to congratulate him and the team on their Super Bowl victory. The President commended Coach McCarthy on his leadership in guiding the team through a rash of injuries both throughout season and during the game. He also asked the coach to pass on how impressed he was with Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgersâ€™ game and season. The President told McCarthy that even a Bears fan can appreciate what the victory means to the people of Green Bay and Wisconsin and said he looks forward to hosting the team at the White House, just as Charles Woodson predicted.
