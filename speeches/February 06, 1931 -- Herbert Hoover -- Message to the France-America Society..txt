My dear Mr. Guthrie:
The celebration of the anniversary of the signing of the treaties with France at Paris on February 6, ]778 is a valuable manifestation of an historic friendship and helps keep alive the feelings of international understanding and good will which are so essential as the firm foundations of world peace. I send to you and the France-America Society my cordial greetings and good wishes.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. William D. Guthrie, President, France-America Society, 270 Madison Avenue, New York City]
