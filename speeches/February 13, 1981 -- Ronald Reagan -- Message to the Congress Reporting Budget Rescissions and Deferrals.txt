    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby withdraw the 33 rescission proposals transmitted to the Congress by the Carter Administration on January 15, 1981 totalling $1,142.4 million and temporarily convert them to deferrals. A list of the withdrawn rescission proposals is attached.
The conversion to temporary deferrals will provide my Administration with the opportunity to review and revise these proposals within the context of my overall plan to curtail the growth of government and reduce Federal spending.
In addition, I am reporting four other new deferrals totalling $8.0 million and a revision to a previously transmitted deferral increasing the amount deferred by $51.1 million. These four new items involve programs in the Departments of the Interior and Transportation and the International Communication Agency. The revision to the existing deferral involves the Department of the Treasury.
The details of the deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
February 13, 1981.
