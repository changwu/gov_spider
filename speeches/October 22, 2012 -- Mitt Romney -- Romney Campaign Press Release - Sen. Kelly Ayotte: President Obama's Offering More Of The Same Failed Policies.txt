    New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte made the following statement on tonight's third presidential debate:
"Today, our allies question the character of our commitments and our adversaries seek to challenge us. It's no wonder why. President Obama has given the cold shoulder to strong allies like Israel. Meanwhile, Iran is four years closer to its goal of nuclear weapons capability, unrest grows in the Middle East, and the President's 'reset' strategy with Russia has failed. In tonight's debate, we saw two visions for America's role in the world. President Obama is offering more of the same failed policies and failed leadership. Mitt Romney will reverse this irresponsible course."
