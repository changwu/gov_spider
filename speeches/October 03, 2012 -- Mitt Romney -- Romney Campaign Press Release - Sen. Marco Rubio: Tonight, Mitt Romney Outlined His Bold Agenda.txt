    Florida Senator Marco Rubio made the following statement on tonight's presidential debate:  
"After watching tonight's debate, the choice this November could not be clearer. A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for four more years of economic stagnation and weak foreign policy; as well as higher taxes, debt, and healthcare costs. A vote for Mitt Romney is a vote for real reforms that will bring a real recovery, including 12 million new jobs, tax relief for the middle class, better healthcare at lower costs, a balanced budget, and leadership for an American century. That's the kind of bold agenda Americans expect and deserve — and that's exactly what Mitt Romney outlined tonight."
