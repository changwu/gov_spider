    BURLINGTON â€“ Two new television ads for Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will hit the airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire beginning Saturday.
One of the ads, "Works for All of Us," focusses on the economy, wages and pay equity.
"If you're doing everything right but find it harder and harder to get by, you're not alone. While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent. My plan: Make Wall Street banks and the ultra-rich pay their fair share of taxes. Provide living wages for working people. Ensure equal pay for women," Sanders says.
"Together, we can make a political revolution and create an economy and democracy that works for all," the senator concludes in the new commercial that will hit the airwaves on Tuesday
The other new ad, "This is how it Works," is about how Wall Street and billionaires bankroll campaigns to maintain a rigged economy.
"The truth is, you can't change a corrupt system by taking its money," Sanders says in the commercial that will be broadcast beginning Saturday.
"It's called a rigged economy and this is how it works. Most new wealth flows to the top 1 percent. It's a system held in place by corrupt politics where Wall Street banks and billionaires buy elections," Sanders says in the ad. "My campaign is powered by over a million small contributions from people like you who want to fight back."
Unlike almost all other presidential candidates who are supported by affiliated super PACs, Sanders instead has received more than 1.3 million donations, averaging about $30 a piece, from more than 800,000 contributors. At rallies across the country packed with the biggest crowds to turn out for any candidate, Sanders has been cheered when he has called for breaking up the country's biggest banks. His proposal to restore the Glass-Steagall Act, the post-Great Depression law regulating Wall Street, is another sure-fire applause line.
