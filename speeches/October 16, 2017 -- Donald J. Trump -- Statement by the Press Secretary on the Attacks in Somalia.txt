    The United States strongly condemns the senseless mass murder that targeted innocent men, women, and children in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 14. The two attacks targeted a public, commercial area of the capital and resulted in the death and injury of hundreds of civilians, including United States citizens.
The United States extends our deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims, their families, and all those who have suffered from terrorism.
Terrorist organizations are the enemies of all civilized people. The United States stands with the people and government of Somalia in their commitment to defeating these groups, ensuring the security of their people, and rebuilding their country.
