    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL)1 President and Georgia State Representative Calvin Smyre.
"We need change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to make it happen," Rep. Smyre said. "Hillary is ready to lead this country on her first day in the White House and her agenda to expand economic and educational opportunities for all Americans will be a welcome change from the last seven years of presidential neglect."
Rep. Smyre has served in the Georgia Legislature for nearly 30 years, rising to the role of Administrative Floor Leader. He serves on the Appropriations Committee, Rules Committee, as well as the House Budget Sub-Committee, Fiscal Affairs Sub-Committee and the Budget Responsibility Oversight Committee.
Rep. Smyre is a past Chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus and a past President of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials.
"In his three decades in public life, Calvin has been a passionate advocate for lifting up the less fortunate and creating a more equal and just society," Clinton said. "I am honored to have his support and delighted that he'll help lead our efforts in Georgia and across the country."
