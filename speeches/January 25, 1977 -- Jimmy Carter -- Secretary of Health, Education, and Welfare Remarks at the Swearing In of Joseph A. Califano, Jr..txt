    There are some members of the political family who know how to have a special deal just for themselves. [Laughter] Unfortunately, the Secretaries of State and Treasury and Defense and others had to combine their oaths of office and the news attention with other people, but Joe worked it out where he could have one of his own.
As some of you know, during the recent campaign Joe Califano was assigned a very important task to perform along with me and did a very superb job in dealing with the American family and how the impact of government in all of its forms impacts either beneficially or adversely on the basic family structure. It was the first speech that I made after my own nomination when I went to New Hampshire.
I think that his appointment as Secretary of HEW will be a very good place for him to demonstrate his sensitivity about this need.
I am very grateful to have Mr. and Mrs. Califano here and the other members of Joe's family. I think this indicates the sound base from which he has given me advice on the family. And I know the Califanos are very happy to see their son assured of steady employment, now that the Senate has confirmed him. [Laughter]
And I think that all of us recognize that one of the key policy planners and instigators of the Johnson years was Joe Califano, who had a deep commitment, which he still retains, of making government services available to those who quite often don't have a strong voice, don't have very much influence, and quite often are the most in need of a sensitive and compassionate government.
He is also a tough administrator, and I believe that the HEW Department will respond very well to this capability on his part.
So, I am very delighted today to introduce to the group--first of all, Justice Brennan has come to administer the oath, and my choice for Secretary of HEW and the Senate's choice for Secretary of HEW, Joe Califano, and his wife, Trudy.
