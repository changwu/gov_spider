    Q. Mr. President, what did you have to say to General Schwarzkopf?
The President. I'm listening. I'm in a listening mode. And besides, this is a photo op, at which I normally do not take questions.
What I'll say to him and when he first got home is, welcome, well-done, and what he and his troops did in terms of fulfilling our objectives is fantastic. And what he and his troops did for the morale of the United States of America is unbelievable.
We have a great team in Secretary Cheney and General Powell and General Schwarzkopf, and the country knows it. You can feel it. Anytime you get out to this place, why, you sense it. It is fantastic. And I told him that and congratulated him.
Q. General Schwarzkopf -- --
Q. -- -- the Oval Office, General?
The President. Would you like to see how a guy should handle the press? Come on, Norm. [Laughter] And don't change your style.
Q. General Schwarzkopf, regardless of your agreement with the President to end the war, do you feel that you would have liked to have gone on and prosecuted it further?
The General. What I'd really like to say is if the President's not going to answer any questions, I damn sure am not going to answer any. [Laughter]
The President. Now you see how to handle them?
