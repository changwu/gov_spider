"In his second term as governor of the seventh-largest state, Kasich has maintained bipartisan popularity as a leader who quickly closed a nasty shortfall in the budget while also cutting unemployment nearly in half."
"Kasich earned similar 'get things done' credentials in the 18 years he served in the U.S. House, where, as Budget Committee chair, he brokered the deal to balance the federal budget for the first time in a generation. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich considers Kasich to be one of the 20th century's four conservative visionaries."

"For the Republican Party to win national elections and bring about the change in Washington that voters are clamoring for, it must build the biggest possible tent and the strongest governing strategy, just as Ronald Reagan would have advised."
