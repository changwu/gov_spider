    Greetings to everyone gathered in our nation's capital to voice your support for providing health security to all Americans. I am delighted that so many of you have come together for this exciting event.
Now is the time to act on our awareness that disabilities are a natural part of the human experience. Having a disability does not diminish one's right to participate in any aspect of mainstream society. With the shared strengths of all those participating in this rally, you send a powerful messageâ€”the key to improving the quality of life for millions of Americans with disabilities and their families is passing a comprehensive health care plan that meets the needs of each one of our citizens.
The active participation of groups like ADAPT, the National Council on Independent Living, and the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities is essential in meeting this crucial goal. I commend you for working toward making health care reform a reality. Your knowledge and expertise are helping to advance the rights of and services for all Americans, especially those persons with disabilities, and I thank you for your leadership and dedication. Working together, we can build a health care system that moves our nation from exclusion to inclusion, from dependence to independence, and from paternalism to empowerment.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a successful rally.
BILL CLINTON
