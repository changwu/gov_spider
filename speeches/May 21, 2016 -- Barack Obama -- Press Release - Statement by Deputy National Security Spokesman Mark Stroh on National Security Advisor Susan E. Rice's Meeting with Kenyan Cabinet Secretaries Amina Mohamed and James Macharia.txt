    Yesterday, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with Kenyan Cabinet Secretaries Amina Mohamed and James Macharia at the White House. They discussed the strong U.S.-Kenya partnership, as highlighted in the President's July 2015 visit to Nairobi, and opportunities to work more closely together to expand security and prosperity in East Africa. In discussing Kenya's recent announcement related to refugees, they mutually acknowledged the importance of maintaining Kenya's longstanding humanitarian leadership with regard to refugees from Somalia and elsewhere, and ways the United States and the international community can support these efforts. Finally, Ambassador Rice reiterated the strong U.S. interest in launching direct flights between Kenya and the United States as soon as possible.
