Excerpts from the endorsement:
We have good choices for President in the Democratic Primary, both are smart and both would have the interest of minorities and urban areas in their administrations. Either one could defeat the representative of Bush's party in November.
Hillary Clinton, however, receives our support for her long standing commitment to implement the Dellums Commission agenda which addresses employment and anti-crime measures. Her experience, knowledge and commitment will serve us well. Her success as New York's senator where she demonstrated an ability to work both sides of the aisle bodes well as to how she could bring us together as a nation. The Post News Group and El Mundo agrees with assembly member Sandre Swanson, council members Ignacio De La Fuente and Jean Quan, Mayors Ron Dellums, Gavin Newsom, Antonio Villaraigosa, and Congresswoman Maxine Waters along with half of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus that Hillary Clinton has the mettle to fight for a green economy, increased educational support, withdrawal from Iraq, jobs for ex-offenders, foreclosure protection and the prosecution of predatory lenders, and increased support for urban areas.
