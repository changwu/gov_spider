Iowa Friends,
Janet and I are hitting the campaign trail today across Iowa.
I will be in Parkersburg, Sheffield, Mason City, Charles City and Garner. And Janet will be in Jefferson, Lake City and Onawa.
We hope to see you at one of our events and please encourage your friends and family to join you.
This January we will be holding 150+ Iowa across the state! And on Thursday I will be campaigning in my 99th Iowa county since May 5!
Share our passion for America, come join us in person or online at www.MikeHuckabee.com!
Thank you,
