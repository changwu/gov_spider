    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kostmayer (D) PA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3764. The river segments that would be designated or subject to study under the bill contain substantial residential, transportation, and commercial development. It would be inappropriate to incorporate such river segments into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
