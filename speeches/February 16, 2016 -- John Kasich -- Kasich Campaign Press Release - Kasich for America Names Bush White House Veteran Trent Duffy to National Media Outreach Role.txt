    Today Kasich for America announced that former White House Deputy Press Secretary Trent Duffy has joined the campaign team as National Communications Advisor, with a focus on national media outreach.
Duffy has extensive knowledge of the national political media having served in the White House for over four years for President George W. Bush, both in the West Wing and as Communications Director for the White House Office of Management and Budget. He has also worked as press secretary for the Republican National Committee, communications director for the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and for the campaigns of former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ).
"We're excited to have Trent join the team when the media interest in Gov. Kasich is rising as quickly as the public's interest and support. He is a respected and experienced communications professional who knows the national media landscape well, and his strong mix of a substantive policy background and communications ability are a good fit for the campaign," said Scott Milburn, Senior Advisor for Communication.
Duffy is a native Ohioan and a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.
