    Today's new research findings about the potential use of the drug tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer are an historic step in the ongoing fight against this deadly disease. Breast cancer strikes one in eight American women, and about 180,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. Each of us has a sister, a daughter, a friend, or in my case, a mother, who has fought against it.
The landmark Breast Cancer Prevention Trial gives us new hope that some women at high risk for breast cancer may actually be able to reduce their risk of getting this life threatening disease. It is an important contribution to our national battle to detect, prevent, treat, and finally cure breast cancer for generations of women to come.
