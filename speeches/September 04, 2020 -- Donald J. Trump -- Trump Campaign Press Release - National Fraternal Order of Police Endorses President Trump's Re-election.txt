    As a result of President Donald J. Trump's steadfast commitment to law and order, the National Fraternal Order of Police, America's oldest and largest law enforcement labor organization representing over 355,000 members, endorsed President Trump for re-election. While Joe Biden shows blatant disregard for the brave men and women in blue, President Trump will always stand with police officers and prioritize the safety of the American people.
"President Trump has shown time after time that he supports our law enforcement officers and understands the issues our members face every day. The FOP is proud to endorse a candidate who calls for law and order across our nation. He has the full and enthusiastic support of the FOP. During his first four years, President Trump has made it crystal clear that he has our backs. Our members know that he listens to the concerns of our brothers and sisters in uniform and is able to make tough decisions on the issues most important to law enforcement. President Trump is committed to keeping our communities and families safe." - Patrick Yoes, Fraternal Order of Police National President
