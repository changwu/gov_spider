    Dole/Kemp '96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"By selling out his own party, Bill Clinton has proven he is ideologically adrift. The good news for Americans is that Bob Dole and Republican Governors were there to show Bill Clinton the light on welfare reform. While Bob Dole and the Republicans lit the flame of welfare reform, Bill Clinton has already signaled his intention to snuff out today's promising start."
