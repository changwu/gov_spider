    President Bush will welcome President Alvaro Colom of the Republic of Guatemala to the White House on April 28, 2008. Guatemala is a longstanding friend of the United States and a country with whom we share deep social and familial ties as well as the value of democracy. The President looks forward to discussing with President Colom a range of common interests, including increasing social development and trade ties, cooperating on security and crime, and strengthening democratic institutions.
