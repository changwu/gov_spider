In Town Pool Report #1 
So here's something new. There is no Marine standing outside the front door, but lower press told me at about 9:45 a.m. POTUS was in the Oval Office receiving daily briefing.Apparently, the Marine no longer is an indicator that POTUS is in the Oval.Good morning, the snow has turned to rain.Your pooler has been tested and is still here.The 12:05 event will feature POTUS making an announcement about the Paycheck Protection Program.The White House sent out a fact sheet on the subject and it is up on www.whitehouse.gov.Here's the latest guidance. It is possible the weather could intrude.EST

In Town Pool Report #9 (The Marine question answered) 
I got this on background from the Press Office.
"In general, the Marine Sentries are posted outside the West Wing Lobby when the President is working in the Oval Office. However, the Marine Sentries are sometimes pulled for other details, including: events occurring at other locations at the White House (South Portico, Rose Garden, State Floor, South Lawn, etc.), support of other world leaders and/or guests of the President and/or First Lady, event dress rehearsals, and last minute details (such as today's direction for them to get COVID tested).
It is a misnomer that the Marine is always there when POTUS is in the Oval."
