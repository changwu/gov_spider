    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget amendments for the Department of Homeland Security. These proposals support the Department's organizational restructuring plan, which Secretary Chertoff transmitted to the Congress on July 13. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2006 Budget would not be increased by this reorganization proposal.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
