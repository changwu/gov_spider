    More than one million hardworking Americans have already received a "Trump Bonus" or "Trump Pay Raise" as a result of the historic tax reform package that President Donald J. Trump signed into law just before Christmas.  President Trump said from the beginning that lowering tax rates, simplifying the complicated tax code, and making our companies more competitive would be the fuel that propels our economy to new heights.  The preliminary results show that the President is right, and American workers and families are the big winners.  And this is only the beginning.  The President remains focused on empowering Americans to build more prosperous lives for themselves and brighter futures for their children.
