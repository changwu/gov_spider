    This week the President is placing a strong emphasis on workforce development. Secretaries Alexander Acosta and Betsy DeVos, along with the President's daughter Ivanka Trump and Reed Cordish with the Office of American Innovation, have been deeply involved in this push. Secretary Acosta addressed this issue this morning at the President's first meeting with a fully confirmed Cabinet. Secretary Acosta delivered a presentation on the importance of expanding apprenticeships in America and the need for all agencies to support the Administration's apprenticeship initiative. A memorandum discussing this policy issue, which every member of the Cabinet received at this morning's meeting, is attached.
