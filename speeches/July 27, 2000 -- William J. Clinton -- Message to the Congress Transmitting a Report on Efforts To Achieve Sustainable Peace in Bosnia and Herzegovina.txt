    To the Congress of the United States:
As required by the Levin Amendment to the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act (section 7 of Public Law 105-174) and section 1203 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I transmit herewith a report on progress made toward achieving benchmarks for a sustainable peace process.
In April 2000, I sent the third semiannual report to the Congress under Public Law 105- 174, detailing progress towards achieving the ten benchmarks adopted by the Peace Implementation Council and the North Atlantic Council for evaluating implementation of the Dayton Accords. This report provides an updated assessment of progress on the benchmarks, covering the period January 1 though June 30, 2000.
In addition to the semiannual reporting requirements of Public Law 105-174, this report fulfills the requirements of section 1203 in connection with my Administration's request for funds for FY 2001.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, July 27, 2000.
