    Memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
Subject: Federal Plan to Break the Cycle of Homelessness
The Federal Plan to Break the Cycle of Homelessness is a pathbreaking document. The Federal Plan sets forth a comprehensive strategy to create a continuum of care system, consolidate duplicative programs, and more comprehensively address the needs of homeless families and individuals by doubling the Housing and Urban Development's homeless budget.
In short, the Federal Plan is a vital first step in addressing one of my top priorities as President. Because of our deep commitment to ending homelessness and the importance of this issue to America, I hereby direct you to work towards building and solidifying support across this Nation for the Federal Plan. Our citizens must understand the principles of the Federal Plan. They must be convinced of the importance of our proposed legislation to reorganize HUD's homeless programs, and they must be persuaded of the critical importance of doubling HUD's homeless budget. Most of all, they must understand our eagerness to work in partnership with local governments, not-for-profit providers, advocates, and others to create a comprehensive continuum of care in all our cities and towns.
I am counting on you and the Department to help create the support that the Federal Plan to Break the Cycle of Homelessness deserves.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
