    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Ford (D) MI and 131 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 1 as reported by the House Committees on Education and Labor and Post Office and Civil Service. By allowing workers to tend to vital family and health care needs without jeopardizing their jobs, this legislation would provide American workers with rights enjoyed by workers in virtually every other advanced industrial nation.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero.
