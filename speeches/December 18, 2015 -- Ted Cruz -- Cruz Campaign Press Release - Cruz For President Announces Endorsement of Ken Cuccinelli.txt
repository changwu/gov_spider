    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Ken Cuccinelli, former Attorney General of Virginia and Republican candidate for Governor in 2013. Throughout his career Cuccinelli has been a tireless advocate and strong leader in the fight to advance conservative principles by standing up to the Washington Cartel to protect life and marriage, stop tax increases, and defend the Constitution.
"I'm pleased to endorse Ted Cruz for President. Not only does he have a proven track record for standing up for conservative values, but he has also demonstrated a willingness to fight back against both the Democrats and the establishment agenda," said Cuccinelli. "His leadership in the Senate has been invaluable to advancing our shared principles. I am confident that he will take these same qualities with him to the White House."
"I am thrilled to have Ken's support for President. He is smart, he's principled and he's fearless," said Cruz. "That last characteristic in particular is a rare quality in elected life. Ken will be a huge asset to our campaign."
