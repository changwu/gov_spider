    First Lady Melania Trump visited the New York Stock Exchange to participate in the timeless tradition of ringing the Opening Bell in celebration of the well being of children, a pillar of her Be Best campaign.
Stacey Cunningham, President of the NYSE, greeted Mrs. Trump upon her arrival and provided a brief tour of the historic building, including a stop at the Buttonwood Agreement. This agreement, signed in 1792, is considered to be the foundation of what would eventually become the New York Stock Exchange.
The First Lady stopped in the Bond Room, which contains some of the country's oldest government bonds, to meet with other leadership from the NYSE and sign the guest book. Mrs. Trump was also presented with a New York Stock Exchange medallion, the ceremonial gift presented to bell ringers, and a bull statue, an iconic symbol of New York's financial markets.
Following the meeting, Mrs. Trump spoke with fourth grade students from the United Nations International School in Siebert Hall – named after the first female member on the NYSE, Muriel Siebert. Prior to meeting the First Lady, the students had the opportunity to learn more about the history of the NYSE. The students presented Mrs. Trump with a framed copy of the United Nations International School's mission statement. At 9:30AM, the First Lady and the students rang the Opening Bell, starting the day's trading session.
"Today's visit to the historic New York Stock Exchange was very special and it was made even more so by spirited students from the United Nations International School. Today was about celebrating children and the message of BE BEST. The NYSE is a great example of the strength of our economic system, which allows programs to grow and to support children around the globe. I want to thank Stacey and the entire New York Stock Exchange for welcoming me today – it was an honor to ring the Opening Bell."
