    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
At this time, $1.074 million of ERF funds will be reallocated within the Department of the Treasury to strengthen the physical protection of the main Treasury building.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
