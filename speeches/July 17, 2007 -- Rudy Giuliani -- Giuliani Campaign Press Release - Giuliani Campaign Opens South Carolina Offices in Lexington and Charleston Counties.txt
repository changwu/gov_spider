    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today officially opened two campaign offices in South Carolina. The offices, which are located in Lexington County and Charleston County, will be home to the day-to-day operations of the campaign staff and serve as the base of operations for volunteer activities in the state. Currently, South Carolina is the only state where the campaign has opened two regional headquarters.
National deputy political director Rick Wiley and South Carolina campaign chairman Barry Wynn joined supporters at both locations for the grand openings.
"Mayor Giuliani's message of leadership and fiscal conservatism is resonating with South Carolinians. This week's announcements demonstrate our strong campaign in South Carolina and our dedication to winning the state's primary," Wiley said.
Today's grand openings followed recent South Carolina staff announcements including a state executive director, communications director, and the first of regional field staff.
