@FoxNews Poll: A majority of Americans want the Democrats to stop investigating President Trump. The Mueller Report said very strongly NO COLLUSION which led to NO OBSTRUCTION. The Dems can't get over 2016 or the conclusive Mueller findings. They are now the Do Nothing Party!Retweets: 3266Favorites: 11773

Wow! CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN record lows. People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies. Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television Don Lemon!Retweets: 25214Favorites: 107472

'Intelligence Agencies were used against an American President.' @DevinNunes @ShannonBream @FoxNews This should NEVER happen to a President again!

'If they try to Impeach President Trump who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion) they will end up getting him re-elected' @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

I don't know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states loud & clear & for all to hear No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a Do-Over!Retweets: 22557Favorites: 91649
