MANCHESTER, NH -- The Richardson campaign today announced the appointment of Alex Goepfert as New Hampshire Communications Director.
"I am very pleased that Alex will be joining my New Hampshire staff," said Governor Richardson. "Alex's experience and understanding on New Hampshire politics will be a great asset to my campaign."
Goepfert comes from a diverse background in political campaigns and television journalism. In 2006, he managed the State Senate campaign of Keene's Molly Kelly in her landslide victory over incumbent Tom Eaton.
"Governor Richardson is the most experienced and most qualified candidate for President," said Goepfert. "I am honored to be a part of the growing momentum of the Richardson campaign in New Hampshire."
Alex Goepfert previously served as press secretary for two statewide campaigns in Ohio. He also worked in television journalism as an assignment editor in the competitive Columbus media market. Most recently, Goepfert served as a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann.
Alex Goepfert joins a growing Richardson team in New Hampshire that includes State Director Janis Hahn and Political Director Daniel McKenna.
