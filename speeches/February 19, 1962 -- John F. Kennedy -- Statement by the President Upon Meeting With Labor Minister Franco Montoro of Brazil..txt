    MR. MINISTER, on this occasion of your visit to the United States I want to extend through you my greetings and best wishes to the leaders and members of the democratic trade union movement of Brazil.
For many years the workers of Brazil have played an important and prominent role in the international labor organizations of the free world. I want to congratulate them and to express my confidence that they will continue to contribute their strength and their knowledge to the free labor movement. The contribution of free labor to the achievement of our mutually held ideals and hopes is becoming daily more significant.
Under the Alliance for Progress the democratic labor movements of all our countries have an important part to play. By the combined effort of all sectors of our free society we shall reach the goal of a better life in freedom and dignity.
