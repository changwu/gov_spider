    John Lynch, for nearly four terms as Governor, has worked across party lines time and time again to grow the New Hampshire economy, improve high school graduation rates, and make it easier for businesses to invest in research and development. Through some tough economic times, John maintained key services for Granite State residents, all while keeping faith with New Hampshire's independent spirit. Michelle and I wish John and his family well and join the people of New Hampshire in thanking him for his many years of service.
