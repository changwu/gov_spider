    Cleveland, Ohio -- Following Governor Walker's commanding debate performance last night, Walker released a new video this morning "And Won" highlighting Walker's winning record as the one best suited to take on Hillary Clinton. Watch here: http://bit.ly/1IqK4N2
As Governor Walker said last night, "People like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top ten wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs."
"I took on the big government union bosses and we won. They tried to recall me and we won. They targeted us again and we won. We balanced the budget, cut taxes and turned our state around with big, bold reforms. It wasn't too late for Wisconsin - and it's not too late for America."
