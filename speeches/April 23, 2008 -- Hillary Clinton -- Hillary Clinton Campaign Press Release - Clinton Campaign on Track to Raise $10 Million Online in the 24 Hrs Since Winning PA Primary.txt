    Historic fundraising pace represents campaign's best day ever
Hillary Clinton's campaign is on track to raise $10 million online in the 24 hours since she was declared the winner of the Pennsylvania primary last night.
"Senator Clinton's game-changing victory last night has turned the tide and resulted in an historic outpouring of grassroots support," said Campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe. "Just like Hillary, our supporters have met every challenge and come through each time. Thanks to them, we will have the resources needed to compete and win as we move ahead to the next contests."
In addition, the campaign has received support from over 60,000 donors through noon today, of whom approximately 50,000 are new donors.
