    Today, the bipartisan National Governors Association expressed support for the historic bipartisan infrastructure framework that will create jobs, generate economic growth, and invest in American competitiveness.
In a joint statement, NGA Chairman New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Vice Chairman Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson wrote, "Governors are encouraged by yesterday's announcement from the White House, establishing a bipartisan framework for historic, new investments in American infrastructure. As Governors have shown, infrastructure is one of the few truly bipartisan issues and this framework recognizes the importance of federal partnership in investment. From the Erie Canal to the Transcontinental Railroad to the Interstate Highway System, big, transformative projects have driven economic growth and innovation. For the past four decades, however, the overall condition of U.S. infrastructure has continued to deteriorate."
They join a growing list of state, local, and federal elected officials of both parties praising the bipartisan framework that will position American workers, farmers, and businesses – small and large alike – to compete and win in the 21st century.
