    This afternoon a tragic event occurred in Los Angeles. The Turkish Consul General, Kemal Arikan, was assassinated in an apparent act of terrorism. I condemn this vicious act.
I have, in addition to communicating with the Turkish Ambassador here in Washington, instructed my administration to forthwith assist local law enforcement in both investigating the murder and, hopefully, bringing this criminal or these criminals to trial so that justice might be done.
