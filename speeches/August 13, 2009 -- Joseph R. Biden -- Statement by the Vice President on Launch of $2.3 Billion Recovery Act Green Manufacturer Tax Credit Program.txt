    It's not enough to just rescue the economy, we have to rebuild it better â€“ and that work begins with giving American manufacturers the resources to produce the clean, green energy technology that will be the foundation of our 21st century economy. With the launch today of $2.3 billion in Recovery Act tax credits for green manufacturers, we are going to ramp up manufacturing of green energy materials in this country, while creating thousands of new jobs right here in our own backyard. From wind and solar power to electric vehicle technology, our recovery is going to be fueled by the Recovery Act incentives we are offering businesses today that will be the engine of our economy tomorrow.
