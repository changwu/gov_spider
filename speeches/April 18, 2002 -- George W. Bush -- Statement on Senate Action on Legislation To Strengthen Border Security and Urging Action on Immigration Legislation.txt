    Improving our Nation's border security is vital to protecting Americans from future terrorist attacks. I commend the Senate for passing legislation that strengthens border security and gives our law enforcement officials additional tools to secure our homeland. I look forward to Congress sending me this important legislation as soon as possible so that I can sign it into law.
I also continue to urge Congress to act to strengthen families and make America more welcoming. Congress should pass a temporary extension under 245(i) so that immigrants eligible to become legal residents will not be forced to leave the country and their families to have their immigration status resolved.
