Today's the big day: It's go time in South Carolina.
We know these primaries are won and lost on voter turnout—so we need to do our part to make sure every last Hillary Clinton supporter in South Carolina gets to the polls today.
The most important thing you can do for Hillary is call a few voters in the Palmetto State. Yes, really.
You don't even need a phone. Just click this link to get started.
It'll go a little something like this: We'll dial up a Hillary supporter in South Carolina. You'll remind them the primary is today and tell them their polling location. (Don't worry, we'll help you with what to say.) They'll thank you, and probably tell you how psyched they are to vote today!
It's really that easy.
If we all make just three calls, we could mobilize tens of thousands of people—and that could make all the difference in this race.
With your help, we can put South Carolina in the win column and keep building our momentum across the country.
So let's get this done for Hillary!
