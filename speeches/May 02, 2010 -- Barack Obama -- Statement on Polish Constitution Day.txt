    On behalf of the American people, I send my warmest congratulations to all who celebrate Polish Constitution Day, both in Poland and here in America. In the 209 years since Poland adopted its Constitution, that document has served as an inspiration to many around the world as a beacon of equality and democratic freedoms. Here at home, Polish Americans are an important part of our national character, serving as leaders in a variety of industries and having helped shape our Nation. The United States and Poland remain close allies and essential partners, and we are bound to each other through our NATO obligations to our collective security. As we continue to confront global challenges together, I am confident that our partnership will only further strengthen and deepen.
As we mark this day of celebration, I want to again express the deep condolences of the American people on the tragic loss of President Lech Kaczynski, First Lady Maria Kaczynska, and the many distinguished military and civilian leaders who were traveling with them. The resilience of the Polish people in the face of this tragedy serves as a model of courage and inspiration to us all.
