    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Representative Breaux (U) Louisiana)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1406, which would reauthorize appropriations of $5 million annually under the Nonqame Act for 1986-1988, because:
— no funds have yet been appropriated tinder the Act;
— the need to reduce the Federal deficit does not permit funding this program;
— existing Pittman-Robertson Act funds can be used for certain nongame purposes at the discretion of the States; and
— States are moving ahead on their own to expand nongame wildlife management efforts and are providing their own financing.
