    Dear Mr. Chancellor:
The news that it has been possible to rescue more of the miners who were trapped underground in the disaster at the Mathilde Mine in Lengede has been received with relief in America. Along with the German people, we have followed intently efforts to bring up the survivors, whose courage we all admire.
I know that I speak for all Americans in asking you to extend our sympathy to the families and friends of those men who lost their lives in this tragic accident.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
