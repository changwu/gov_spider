    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Bulgaria to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act").
The Government of Bulgaria has requested designation as a GSP beneficiary country. The decision to extend GSP treatment to Bulgaria was made in light of the continuing changes in Eastern Europe, and in the spirit of the Trade Enhancement Initiative for Central and Eastern Europe. I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria, and particularly Bulgaria's ongoing political and economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Bulgaria.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
George Bush
