Travel pool report #5 - Biden arrival
The motorcade pulled up to the convention center at 10:25 am. Biden entered the welcome hall at 10:26 am local time. He walked down a long corridor and through the entrance to greet Indian PM Modi, who was standing in front of a giant sign with the G20 logo and the official slogan, "One earth. One family. One future."
POTUS asked, "how are you?" As he approached. He appeared to jog up a slight incline as he walked over to Modi. The two leaders shook hands, and continued to hold hands as they spoke and turned to face the large sign behind them. POTUS waved and exited at 10:27 am.
Biden was the second to last of the leaders to arrive. MBS was last.
Per WH: Greeting the President for the official handshake upon arrival at the International Expo Convention Center (IECC), New Delhi, India:Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Republic of IndiaAnshuman Gaur, Chief of ProtocolAseem Vohra, Deputy Chief of Protocol Color from inside:
Flags for each nation in attendance lined a red carpet that extended from the leaders' entrance through a set of double doors into the main hall.
Some notable interactions: Modi hugged UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and British PM Rishi Sunak. German Chancellor Scholz arrived wearing a black eye patch. The two appeared to discuss it as Scholz gestured toward his eye (he had a jogging accident earlier this week). Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and Modi laughed heartily as they shook hands but pool could not hear what prompted the laughter.
Modi had a firm and extended handshake with Turkey's Erdogan and walked over to greet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Big hugs for Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who was accompanied by his wife.

Travel pool report #8 - World Bank group photo
POTUS is participating in a group photo with the leaders of India, Brazil, South Africa and the World Bank in the welcome hall where he first arrived this morning.
He entered the welcome hall at 2:20 pm local time.
The leaders posed in front of flags from their countries, positioned in front of the image of the Odisha's Konark Wheel (see below) that Modi stood in front of for the arrival. They posed for a few photos before linking hands for another round of photos.
POTUS did not respond to a question about the earthquake in Morocco. POTUS exited at 2:22 pm local time.
We're running about 50 minutes behind schedule.
One slight correction pool report #5 –MBS was the last of the leaders to arrive for the beginning of the summit, but France's Macron had yet to arrive. He was expected to skip the first session (though he is listed as in attendance). He is apparently arriving soon, according to French pool.
Some other points of note that I neglected to put in previous reports as we were hurried between rooms:

The image Modi stood in front of as he greeted leaders upon their arrival was of the Konark Sun Temple Wheel in Odisha
During the first session, Modi officially moved to make the African Union a permanent member of the G20. He struck his gavel three times, making it official. He embraced the leaders as the room applauded.
