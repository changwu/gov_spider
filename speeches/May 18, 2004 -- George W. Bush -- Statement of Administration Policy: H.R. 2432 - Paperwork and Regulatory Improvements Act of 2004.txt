    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Ose (R) CA and nine cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of the Ose substitute amendment to H.R. 2432. The bill would make a number of important changes to the paperwork and regulatory processes. The Administration is pleased that the Ose substitute amendment removes a provision that would have required the President to submit the annual cost-benefit report "as part of" the Budget rather than "with" the Budget. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress on this legislation as it moves through the legislative process.
