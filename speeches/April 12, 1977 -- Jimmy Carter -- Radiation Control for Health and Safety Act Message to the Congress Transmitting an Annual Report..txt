    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1976 annual report on the administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act (Public Law 90-602), as prepared by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for a period of time prior to the commencement of my term.
The report's only legislative recommendation is that the requirement for the report itself, as contained in P.L. 90-602, be repealed. All of the information found in the report is available to Congress on an immediate basis through congressional committee oversight and budget hearings. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has concluded that this annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive activities.
