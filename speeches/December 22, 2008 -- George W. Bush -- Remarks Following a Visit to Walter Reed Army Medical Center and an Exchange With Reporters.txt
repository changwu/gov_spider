    The President. Every time I come here, I get amazed at the quality of care, the professionalism, and the courage of our troops. I can say with certainty that the health care that our troops get in the military medical facilities is excellent. I am so pleased to hear from spouses and other loved ones about the care they get as well, when they come to visit their wounded child or wounded husband or wounded spouse.
And so this will probably be my last time coming here as the Commander in Chief. It gives me a great pleasure to thank all those who serve here and all those who serve throughout our military, the military medical facilities. You know, I oftentimes say being the Commander in Chief of the military is the thing I'll miss the most, and coming here to Walter Reed is a reminder of why I'll miss it.
Thank you very much.
President's Health
Q. How is your shoulder, Mr. President?
The President. Yes, good shape, it's about an 80-mile-an-hour fastball.
