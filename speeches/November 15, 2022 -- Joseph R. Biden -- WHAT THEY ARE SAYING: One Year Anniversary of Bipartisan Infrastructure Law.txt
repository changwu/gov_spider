    One year ago, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ? a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure and competitiveness.
To date, the Administration has announced over $185 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and nearly 7,000 specific projects, reaching over 4,000 communities across all 50 states, D.C., and the territories. The President, Vice President, Cabinet, and senior federal leaders have traveled on more than 200 trips to all 50 states, as well as D.C., Puerto Rico, and territories.
The Biden-Harris Administration is already following through on its promise to deliver results by rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, and airports, upgrading public transit and rail systems, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, cleaning up legacy pollution, providing affordable, high-speed internet to every family in America, delivering cheaper and cleaner energy, creating good-paying jobs, and building a clean energy economy.
