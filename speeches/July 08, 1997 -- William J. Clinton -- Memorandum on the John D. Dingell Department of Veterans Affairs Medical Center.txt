    Memorandum for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Subject: John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center
A veteran of World War II, a local prosecutor, and since 1955, representing the people of Michigan in the Congress, John D. Dingell has served his country and his State with distinction for over 50 years. Furthermore, throughout his career Congressman Dingell has championed both quality health care and veterans' rights. I therefore take great pleasure in honoring Congressman Dingell by naming the VA Medical Center in Detroit after him.
Thus, in recognition of Congressman Dingell's leadership and exemplary service to our country, I direct that the VA facility located at 4646 John R. in Detroit, Michigan, hereafter be known as the John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. You are directed to take such further actions as necessary to effect the naming of this facility for Congressman Dingell.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
