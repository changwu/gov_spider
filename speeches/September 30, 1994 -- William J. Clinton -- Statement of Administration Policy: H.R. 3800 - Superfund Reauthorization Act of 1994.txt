    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Swift (D) Washington and four others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3800, which will ensure a faster, fairer, and more efficient Superfund program.
The reforms contained in H.R. 3800 will reduce Superfund cleanup and transaction costs, enhance State authority and community involvement in cleanups, and encourage advances in superfund- related science and technology. These reforms will improve protection for human health and the environment and will stimulate economic redevelopment.
It is essential to the management of the Superfund program that the reforms contained in H.R. 3800 be enacted in the 103rd Congress.
The Administration would oppose any amendments to H.R. 3800 that would change scorekeeping rules under the Budget Enforcement Act for this bill or otherwise amend that Act.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3800 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. This Office estimates the pay-as-you-go effect of H.R. 3800 would be to decrease the deficit by $1.9 billion over FYs 1995-1999. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
