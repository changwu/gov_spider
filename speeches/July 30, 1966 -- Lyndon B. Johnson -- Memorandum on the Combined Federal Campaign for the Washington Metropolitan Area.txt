    Memorandum to Heads of Departments and Agencies
I am pleased to announce that the Honorable John T. Connor, Secretary of Commerce, will serve as Chairman of this year's Combined Federal Campaign for the Washington Metropolitan Area. This is an important job and I am glad that Secretary Connor has agreed to undertake it.
This year's campaign, to begin in the fall, combines into one single drive the campaigns of the United Givers Fund, the National Health Agencies, and the International Service Agencies. In this one drive we will be seeking to do our share to meet the needs of over 150 local, national, and international health, welfare, and social service agencies.
The success of the past two Combined Federal Campaigns shows that Federal employees heartily favor a once-a-year drive to support these worthwhile voluntary organizations. A combined drive is more convenient for employees, making it possible for them to give their contribution through payroll deductions. Also, it is more economical for the Government since it cuts down on the number of campaigns.
The coming Combined Federal Campaign is very important to the voluntary organizations and to the millions of people, at home and abroad, who depend on them for help. I hope Federal employees will be generous in their support.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the Combined Campaign in your organization and appoint a top assistant as your Vice Chairman. Secretary Connor should be advised promptly of the person you designate your Vice Chairman.
