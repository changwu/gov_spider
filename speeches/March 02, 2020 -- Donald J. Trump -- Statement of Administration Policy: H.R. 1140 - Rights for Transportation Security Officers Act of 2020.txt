    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Thompson, D-MS and 242 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1140, which would change how Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are compensated by making their employment subject to the provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code. The current personnel system authorized by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) just months after the September 11th attacks provides the flexibility TSA needs so that it can quickly and efficiently adjust its workforce management to respond to emerging threats or national emergencies. It also benefits the workforce, as reflected in the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel, an independent review of TSA's human capital program conducted in FY 2019 by public and private-sector personnel systems experts.
The Administration is grateful for the dedicated service of the workforce of the TSA, which has remained strong and flexible even in the face of evolving challenges. We are committed to providing TSA's employees with competitive compensation and benefits. That goal should be accomplished, however, through the budget, rather than through a statutory reclassification of TSA's workforce. That is why the President's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget proposes annual pay increases for Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). The President's budget proposal allows for predictable pay progression and provides funding for merit-based pay increases for high-performing TSOs. It optimizes existing authorities and properly resources ongoing workforce initiatives. As such, the President's budget better meets the needs of TSA, its workforce, and taxpayers than H.R. 1140.
If H.R. 1140 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
