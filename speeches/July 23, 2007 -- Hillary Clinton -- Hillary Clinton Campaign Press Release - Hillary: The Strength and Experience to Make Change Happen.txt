    Tonight in South Carolina, Hillary again demonstrated that she has the strength and experience to lead our country and deliver the change Americans want.
Hillary made it clear that she would engage in diplomacy around the globe, but would not meet unconditionally with dictators like Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il who have shown no willingness to come to the bargaining table.
And she pressed President Bush to begin planning to redeploy our troops safely, so that we are better prepared to get out of Iraq then we were getting in.
Americans are ready for change, and Hillary showed she is ready to lead that change. She demonstrated her deep understanding of the issues and proved that she has the strength to tackle the big challenges facing America today. She outlined her plan to create a $50 billion strategic energy fund that would end tax breaks for oil companies and spur innovation and investment in clean and renewable technologies.
Hillary made clear: "We may be able finally to break that hardest of all glass ceilings, but obviously I'm not running because I'm a woman. I'm running because I think I'm the most qualified and experienced person to hit the ground running in January 2009."
