    Q. What's on the agenda, Mr. President?
The President. We're working on the budget. You know what we're doing. [Laughter]
Q. Still?
Q. [Inaudible]—all the decisions, sir?
The President. No, otherwise I wouldn't be asking them to meet on Saturday.
Q. Mr. President, have you heard anything from the lawmakers that would cause you to change your mind on any policies that you intend to propose?
The Vice President. That's kind of a broad question anyway. [Laughter]
The President. I've gotten a lot of good advice from them, a lot of good ideas. I've basically just been asking them for their ideas, not only in the meetings here but in telephone calls. And I've gotten some good suggestions, some of which we've been able to incorporate.
Q. How long do you think you're going to have to work?
The President. I'm going to work a while today and a while tomorrow and a while—
Q. You playing golf today?
The President. It doesn't look like it. It's warmer today, though, isn't it?
Q. A little wet.
The President. I knew as soon as I decided not to play golf it would warm up.
