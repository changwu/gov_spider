    The United States is concerned by reports that Egypt's April 8 local council elections were characterized by widespread electoral violations. We have been troubled by the reports of harassment, detainment, and arrests of opposition candidates and campaign workers in the lead up to the elections, as well as the allegations that large numbers of opposition candidates were prevented from registering.
We believe that the Egyptian people deserve the opportunity to peacefully express their views by means of the ballot box. They should not only be able to vote without fear of intimidation, but should also be able to choose freely from a variety of candidates. We continue to urge the Egyptian Government to take tangible steps towards greater democracy, freedom, and political openness.
