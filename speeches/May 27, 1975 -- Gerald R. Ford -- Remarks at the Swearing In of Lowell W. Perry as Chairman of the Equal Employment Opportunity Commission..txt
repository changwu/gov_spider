    Lowell, Mrs. Perry, Judge Keith, distinguished guests:
This is a very great moment in this Administration. It is my great privilege and pleasure to have selected for this very vital role a person that I have known a good many years, a person that I have admired for many, many years.
He first came to my attention when I saw his prowess on the gridiron at the University of Michigan. He made it and I didn't. He was really good and played not only exceptionally well at Ann Arbor but very well for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
I have known Lowell over a period of time since then. I have always looked at his career, both in Government and with private employment, as an example of what a person can do who has got ability and the desire and the dedication.
I think it's, in this instance, Government's gain to have Lowell with us, and Lynn Townsend probably is losing one of his very finest young people in his Chrysler organization.
It just seems to me that Lowell Perry is the right person to do a fine job in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and I look forward to the job that he will do.
This Administration is totally dedicated to the elimination of any discrimination in the area of sex, race, creed, color, or what have you. Under the leadership of Lowell Perry, I am certain and positive that that dedication to that cause will be carried out.
And it is a great privilege, Lowell, for me to participate in your oath-taking with your old friend, and a friend of mine, Judge Damon Keith of the Federal Court in Detroit.
