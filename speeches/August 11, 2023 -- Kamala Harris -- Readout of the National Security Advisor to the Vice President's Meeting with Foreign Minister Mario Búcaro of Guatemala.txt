    Ahead of Guatemala's presidential runoff election on August 20, National Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon met today with Foreign Minister Mario BÃºcaro of Guatemala to underscore the importance of a free, fair, and transparent process. Dr. Gordon emphasized that a peaceful transition between administrations is important and fundamental to a democracy. They discussed the United States and Guatemala's work to advance safe and legal pathways for migrants through continued implementation of the Safe Mobility Office program, the implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration from Central America, which Vice President Harris continues to oversee, the $4.2 billion in private sector investments that the Vice President's leadership has helped generate to provide economic opportunity in northern Central America, and regional issues, including support for a multinational force in response to Haiti's request for security assistance.
