    MODESTO, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday issued the following statement after Hillary Clinton delivered a speech criticizing Donald Trump's foreign policy vision:
"I agree with Secretary Clinton that Donald Trump's foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible. But when it comes to foreign policy, we cannot forget that Secretary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history, and that she has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through the consequences.
"We need a foreign policy based on building coalitions and making certain that the brave American men and women in our military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. That's what I will fight for as president."
