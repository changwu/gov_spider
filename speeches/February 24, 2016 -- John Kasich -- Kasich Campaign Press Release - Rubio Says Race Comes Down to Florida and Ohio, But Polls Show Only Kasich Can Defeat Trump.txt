    Defeating Trump requires a consolidated effort. And no states are more important to making that happen than Florida and Ohio. Just ask Marco Rubio.
"By the time you get to March 15, now you're in some big states like Ohio and Florida that award all their delegates at once. That's where you have to start winning states..." —Marco Rubio, Feb. 24, Politico
But for Senator Rubio there's a big problem. Polls in Florida show that, at the very best, Rubio is losing to Trump by double digits. The two most recent polls average Trump at 34 percent and Rubio 15 points back. Even if the senator gains every single Bush supporter, Rubio still loses Florida to Trump by double digits.
There's a much different story going on in Ohio where John Kasich is in a very good position to defeat Trump. In fact, a poll just released today asked if the race was consolidated down to Trump versus Kasich, Kasich would win Ohio by 17 points. At the same time, Sens. Rubio and Cruz lose to Trump in one-on-one races. Even when all candidates are considered, Kasich is in a statistical tie with Trump — again, a far better position than Rubio can claim in Florida.
Again, even Marco Rubio agrees this race comes down to Florida and Ohio, but only John Kasich is in a position to win.
