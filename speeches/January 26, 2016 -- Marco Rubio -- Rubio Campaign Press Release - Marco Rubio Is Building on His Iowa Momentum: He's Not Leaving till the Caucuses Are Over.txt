 Marco has made 10 campaign stops already this week, including a packed event where he was introduced by Senator Joni Ernst.
Yesterday, Marco dominated the Republican debate in Des Moines
Marco will then have more events through the weekend, starting with town halls in Burlington, Muscatine, Clinton, and Dubuque on Friday.
On Saturday, Marco will hold events in Sioux City, Council Bluffs, Ames, and Urbandale. The Urbandale event will feature Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley!
Marco's push continues with Sunday events in Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids, and Davenport. His Iowa swing will end with a celebratory Caucus Night event on Monday. 
As Marco's momentum in the state grows, he's working hard to make sure he finishes strong.
