    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Stevens (R) AK and four others)
The Administration would support S. 2216 if it were amended to make Constitution Day a Day of Recognition, rather than a Federal holiday. In a time of massive Federal deficits, it would be unwise to grant another paid holiday to Federal employees, (who already get 10 paid holidays a year) at a cost to the Government of $332 million. It is not possible to estimate precisely the total cost to the Nation of a holiday that could also affect State, local and private sector employees, but a rough estimate is that for each 10% of the nonfarm private sector workforce that is given the day off and does not make up the time lost, the cost is over a billion dollars.
