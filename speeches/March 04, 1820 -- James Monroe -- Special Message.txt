    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit to the Senate, in pursuance of their resolution of the 4th of January last, a report from the Secretary of State, with a list of fines curred under the act of Congress entitled "An act in addition to the act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States," which appear from the records of the Department of State to have been remitted by the Executive authority of the United States.
