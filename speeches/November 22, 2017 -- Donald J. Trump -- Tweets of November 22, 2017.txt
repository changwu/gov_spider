It wasnt the White House it wasnt the State Department it wasnt father LaVars so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor mans version of Don King but without the hair. Just think..Retweets: 33183Favorites: 126400

...LaVar you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar shoplifting is NOT a little thing. Its a really big deal especially in China. Ungrateful fool!Retweets: 39047Favorites: 160972
