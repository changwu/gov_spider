    I HEREWITH transmit a draft bill, "to authorize reduction or suspension of import barriers to restrain inflation."
The proposed legislation would authorize the President to reduce or suspend temporarily any duty applicable to any article and to increase temporarily any value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction whenever the President determines that supplies of the article imported are inadequate to meet domestic demand at reasonable prices.
The enactment of this bill is necessary to provide an important additional means of restraining inflation and aiding the American consumer.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
