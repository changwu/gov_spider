    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the 1995 Revision of the Radio Regulations, with appendices, signed by the United States at Geneva on November 17, 1995 (the "1995 Revision"), together with declarations and reservations of the United States as contained in the Final Acts of the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95). I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning these revisions.
The 1995 Revision, which was adopted at WRC-95, constitutes a revision of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations, to which the United States is a party. It provides for the simplification of the Radio Regulations, the introduction of new global mobile-satellite services, and new regulatory provisions both for non-geostationary satellites operating in the same frequency bands as geostationary satellites and for other new space services that share spectrum with the space research and terrestrial services.
Subject to the U.S. declarations and reservations mentioned above, I believe the United States should become a party to the 1995 Revision, which will facilitate the development of mobile-satellite and non-geostationary satellite orbit communication services by U.S. Government and industry. It is my hope that the Senate will take early action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
