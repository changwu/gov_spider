    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday welcomed the endorsement of the Communications Workers of America. CWA's endorsement comes after tens of thousands of members participated in an online vote that lasted six weeks.
"Brothers and sisters, let me thank the 700,000 members of the Communications Workers of America for their strong support," Sanders said. "For decades you've been fighting for the rights of working families and I'm so proud today to be with you in that fight."
"CWA members endorsed Bernie Sanders because he is the candidate who is talking about real solutions to make our economy fair again. Politics as usual has gotten working people nowhere. It's time for real change. That's what CWA members are saying, loud and clear," CWA President Chris Shelton said. "Our members are ready to do what it takes to elect Bernie Sanders as the next president of the United States."
CWA represents 700,000 Americans who work in telecommunications and information technology, the airline industry, news media, broadcast and cable television, education, health care and public service, law enforcement, manufacturing and other fields. The union has more than 300,000 active and retired members in the states that will hold primaries between now and April 1. In California, Texas, New York, New Jersey and Ohio, where CWA has its largest numbers of members, activists are engaged in worksite actions, staffing phone banks and signing up new contributors to CWA's political program ahead of the 2016 election.
CWA members have played a significant role in driving turnout in past elections. In 2012, tens of thousands of CWA member volunteers worked on national and state campaigns and for critical ballot initiatives. CWA had ground operations in 38 states, and CWA member-activists played a major role in Florida, Colorado, Virginia, Missouri, New Mexico, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio
