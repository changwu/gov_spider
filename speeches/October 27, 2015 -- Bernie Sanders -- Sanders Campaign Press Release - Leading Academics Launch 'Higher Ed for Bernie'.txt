    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€” As supporters from 250 colleges and universities across the country prepare to host campus town hall meetings on Wednesday, scholars from a variety of disciplines and universities, prominent journalists and union leaders issued a statement in support of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. The statement marks the launch of a new organizing initiative, Higher Ed for Bernie, which includes about 400 members.
"Bernie Sanders is the only candidate seeking the nomination from either party who has a serious and concrete proposal and demonstrated a resolute commitment to higher education," the statement reads. "That is why we endorse and support his campaign enthusiastically and urge others who share those concerns to join with us."
Sanders' universal higher education program, which would eliminate undergraduate tuition at four-year public colleges and universities and take steps to relieve and reverse the crippling burden of student loan debt, resonated with Higher Ed for Bernie members. The group says Sanders' plan makes "a powerful statement about the central importance of higher education as a public good."
Higher Ed for Bernie will sponsor events on college campuses across the country, on issues of tuition-free public higher education, college affordability, and academic labor.
The full statement and a list of Higher Ed for Bernie supporters can be found here.
