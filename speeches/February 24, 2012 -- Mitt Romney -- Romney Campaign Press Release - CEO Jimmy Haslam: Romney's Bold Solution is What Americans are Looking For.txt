    President and CEO of Pilot Travel Centers Jimmy Haslam issued the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan to restore America's promise.
"Americans are sick of politicians and Washington insiders kicking the can down the road on the serious problems our country faces, all the while hoping that the day of reckoning doesn't come on their watch. Mitt Romney has proposed a bold solution to actually fix the major economic problems facing our country: high taxes, out-of-control spending, and the need to reform entitlements. No other candidate in either party can claim such an ambitious and sweeping vision. This audacious leadership is the reason I am proud to stand with Mitt."
