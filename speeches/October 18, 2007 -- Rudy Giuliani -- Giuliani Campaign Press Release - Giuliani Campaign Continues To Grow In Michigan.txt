    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Campaign today announces another addition to its Michigan campaign staff. Justine Ivanoff joined the campaign this week as a field staffer. She will help organize grassroots support for Mayor Giuliani in the state.
"We're excited to be expanding our campaign in Michigan at a time when other candidates are pulling out of the state altogether," said Giuliani's Michigan Campaign Chair U.S. Representative Candice Miller. "Mayor Giuliani's strong leadership and record of real results on the economy and lowering taxes resonates with Michigan voters â€“ more of whom will hear Rudy's message as we continue to grow our operation in state."
The campaign recently announced that Lynn Aronoff joined Team Rudy as Michigan State Political Director.
