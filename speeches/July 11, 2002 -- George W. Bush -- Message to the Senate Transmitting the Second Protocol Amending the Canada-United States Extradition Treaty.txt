    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Second Protocol Amending the Treaty on Extradition Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada, as amended, signed at Ottawa on January 12, 2001. In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Second Protocol. As the report explains, the Second Protocol will not require implementing legislation.
The Second Protocol amends the Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada, signed at Washington on December 3, 1971, as amended by an Exchange of Notes of June 28 and July 9, 1974, and by a Protocol signed at Ottawa on January 11, 1988.
The Second Protocol, upon entry into force, will enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both nations. The Second Protocol incorporates into the U.S.-Canada Extradition Treaty a provision on temporary surrender of persons that is a standard provision in more recent U.S. bilateral extradition treaties. It also provides for new authentication requirements for documentary evidence, which should streamline the processing of extradition requests.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Second Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
