    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of former Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan. Ryan, the 2002 Republican nominee for Illinois Governor, is currently a Benedictine University professor.
Ryan, who served as Attorney General from 1995 to 2003, is the latest high-profile endorsement for Mayor Giuliani in Illinois. Ryan joins former Illinois Governor Jim Thompson and DuPage County State's Attorney Joseph Birkett, who endorsed the Mayor earlier this month while he was visiting the state.
"Rarely will you find a candidate with the executive leadership experience and proven record of fiscal discipline and crime fighting like Rudy Giuliani," said Ryan. "He is the proven leader who has never been afraid to take on tough challenges and find common sense solutions."
"Attorney General Ryan is a well-respected and successful prosecutor, whose commitment to justice and our legal system is admirable," said Michael DuHaime, Giuliani's National Campaign Manager. "I'm honored to have Jim as part of our team in Illinois because it is an important state in helping to elect Mayor Giuliani as the next President of the United States."
