    Thank you, Reverend Wu, Reverend Siu, Reverend Yin. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for making me and my family and our party of Americans feel so welcome in your church today. We are a long way from home, but we felt very much at home with you here in this church.
We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith in China, and we rejoice to hear Reverend Siu cite the numbers of churches and other places of worship where people are practicing their faith today.
The sermon today was on the unity of the church and our unity with God in the church. I would like to add only one point: I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world of different races and backgrounds and creeds. In the Book of Acts, the 26th verse, it is said that God has made from one blood every nation to dwell on the surface of the Earth. I believe that is true. Therefore, I believe that Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters as children of God. We come here in that spirit today, grateful for your welcome.
