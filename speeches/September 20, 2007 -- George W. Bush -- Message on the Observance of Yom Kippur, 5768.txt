    For it is a Day of Atonement, on which expiation is made on your behalf before the LORD your God.
LEVITICUS 23:28
On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, the faithful leave behind their daily concerns and gather together to draw near to God. This day is a time when Jews everywhere reflect on their lives, seek forgiveness, and find solace in God's merciful nature.
The Shofar's call signals our recommitment to our Creator and to each other. In the year ahead, may we all be reminded of the Almighty's steadfast love for His children and achieve the peace we all seek.
Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed Yom Kippur.
GEORGE W. BUSH
