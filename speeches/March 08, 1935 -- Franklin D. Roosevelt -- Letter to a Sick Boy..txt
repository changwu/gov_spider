    My dear Charles:
One of your good friends has told me about you and of the splendid courage you have shown during your long illness. Just keep up your fine spirit and don't let anything at all discourage you.
I am writing this little note to send you a personal word of cheer and my very best wishes.
Very sincerely yours,
Charles Snow Smith,
