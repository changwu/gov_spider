    Hillary for America Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the following statement on Donald Trump's dangerous plan to deport millions of immigrants:
"Donald Trump reinforced today that he would deport 16 million people, including every undocumented immigrant and American citizens born here to undocumented parents.  Confirming what we've seen from the start of his campaign: Donald Trump will be Donald Trump. No one can change his hateful rhetoric or dangerous policies to send a deportation force into American communities, rescind DACA and DAPA, end birthright citizenship, and even ban remittances to families in Mexico in order to help build his giant wall. He may try to disguise his plans by throwing in words like "humane"  or " fair," but the reality remains that Trump's agenda echoes the extreme right's will–one that is fueling a dangerous movement of hatred across the country.
"Enough is enough. Donald Trump must stop playing games with the lives of law-abiding immigrant families in order to save his campaign. These are families who contribute to the greatness of our country and that need a President who will fight to keep them together–not someone who will denigrate them and tear them apart."
