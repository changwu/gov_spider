    Iowa's Gov. Terry Branstad had this to say about Gov. Perry's visit to Iowa last week (Des Moines Regiser):
"I think he did a tremendous job at the Iowa State Fair," said Branstad, a fellow Republican. "I thought he was as relaxed and confident and at home at the Iowa State Fair as anybody I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them. He comes from a farm background, he's a former agriculture commissioner, he's a graduate of Texas A&M."
Branstad added: "Only thing, in Texas they always say how big everything is and we tend to downplay and understate here. But I think he came across very well."
Asked about Perry's comment in Iowa last week that it would be "almost treasonous" for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to attempt to revive the economy by directly injecting money, Branstad said it had to be taken in context.
Perry said last Monday, according to CBS News: "If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I dunno what y'all would do to him in Iowa but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas. Printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treasonous in my opinion."
Branstad today said: "I think that was probably the wrong choice of words. But the idea that somehow we're going to correct our problems in this country by printing more money, I think people are apprehensive about that."
