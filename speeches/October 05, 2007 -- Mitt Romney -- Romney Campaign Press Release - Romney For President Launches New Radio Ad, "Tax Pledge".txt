AD FACTS: Script For "Tax Pledge" (Radio:60):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "It started in New Hampshire. It's the Tax Pledge. For years, conservative candidates for President signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases."
- New Hampshire Has A Tradition Of No Taxes Pledges Beginning With Governor Mel Thomson Jr. (R-NH). "Though reared in the South, always courtly and speaking with a drawl, Mel Thomson was Carborundum hard on the central question of taxation. His reply to advocates of a 'broad-based' tax was direct. He ran on the platform 'ax the tax.' Not surprisingly, New Hampshire began to enjoy an economic boom. ... After Thomson left office, all serious statewide and national candidates 'took the pledge' against taxes. Even Jeanne Shaheen, the present governor and a moderate Democrat, 'took the pledge' when running for her first term, and kept her word." (Jeffrey Hart, "Medrim Thomson, R.I.P.," National Review, 5/14/01)
- Governor Romney Is Endorsed By Leading Anti-Tax Advocate Tom Thomson, The Son Of The Late Governor Mel Thomson, Jr. "Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that Tom Thomson has endorsed his candidacy for President of the United States. Mr. Thomson is a widely respected small business owner, anti-tax advocate, and son of the late New Hampshire Governor Mel Thomson Jr., who's 'Ax the Tax' platform inspired future state and national candidates to take a pledge against raising taxes. ... With his endorsement today, Tom Thomson issued the following statement: 'After much thought and consideration I have decided to endorse the Republican candidate I believe is best for the country and is best positioned to win in 2008. He was the first presidential candidate to sign Americans for Tax Reform's anti-tax pledge, and he has made tax relief a top priority." (Romney For President, "Anti-Tax Advocate Tom Thomson Endorses Governor Mitt Romney For President," Press Release, 10/4/07)
- Former Congressman Vin Weber (R-MN): The Tax Pledge "Has Become Institutionalized In Republican Politics" As "An Economic Policy" In Itself. VIN WEBER: "Governor Romney immediately took the no-new taxes pledge, no-tax-increase pledge. And he understands that that's the right economic policy, but the point that we make is the no-tax pledge, which has become institutionalized in Republican politics, has become more than just a political device. It's really become an economic policy." (CNBC's "Kudlow & Company," 4/4/07)
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for President to sign the Tax Pledge. The others have not. I signed the Tax Pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy. I believe it's not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money, and when you die."
- Governor Romney Was The First 2008 Presidential Candidate To Sign The "Taxpayer Protection Pledge" Promising To Oppose Any Effort To Increase Taxes. "Demonstrating his commitment to oppose any effort to increase taxes on the American people, Governor Romney has signed Americans For Tax Reform's 'Taxpayer Protection Pledge.' As part of his pledge, Governor Romney will 'oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates' and 'oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits.'" (Romney For President Exploratory Committee, "Governor Mitt Romney Signs 'Taxpayer Protection Pledge'," Press Release, 1/4/07)

- Governor Romney Is The Only Major Republican Presidential Candidate To Have Signed The Pledge. GROVER NORQUIST: "Governor Mitt Romney was the first candidate to sign the pledge then all the other candidates, including some of the second-tier candidates, have signed the pledge. The one candidate who's not yet, or two candidates who've not yet signed the pledge, are Rudy Giuliani and Senator McCain. Senator McCain did sign it when he ran in 2000, so it's a little disappointing that he hasn't signed it in 2008. Giuliani's people have said he's likely to sign it, but it hasn't happened yet." CNBC's ERIN BURNETT: "And Fred Thompson hasn't signed it because of course he's not technically running?" NORQUIST: "Correct. He has not – he's not yet announced." (CNBC's "Street Signs," 8/29/07)
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "That's why I'll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board."
- Governor Romney Will Roll Back Tax Rates Across The Board For All Americans. As President, Governor Romney will cut marginal tax rates across the board, allowing all Americans to save more money. This approach is fair, simple and extends the pro-growth benefits of tax rate cuts to all Americans.
- Governor Romney Will Kill The Death Tax. It is unfair to tax the American people three times: once when they earn their money; second when they invest it and receive income from those investments; and third when they die.
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "And savings? When I'm President, for every middle class American, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero."
- Governor Romney Will Make Middle Class Savings Tax Free. Governor Romney's plan will allow middle class Americans to save tax free by changing the tax rate on interest, capital gains and dividends to absolutely 0%. By helping more Americans save and invest, we can meet the challenges of an aging population and ensure the financial security of America.
- Governor Romney's Plan Will Allow Over 95% Of American Families To Save And Invest Tax-Free. Any taxpayer with Adjusted Gross Income of under $200,000 would pay a tax rate of absolutely 0% on all of the income they earn from their savings, capital gains and dividends.
