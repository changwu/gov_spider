    PRESIDENT KENNEDY and Prime Minister Macmillan have had a most valuable exchange of views about the situation in Laos. This will be of great assistance to the representatives of the two countries in the discussions at the SEATO meeting which is due to begin in Bangkok tomorrow.
They agree that the situation in Laos cannot be allowed to deteriorate.
They also agree that the recent British note to the Soviet Union contains proposals which, if implemented, would bring to an end the warfare in Laos and would pave the way for Laos to become the truly neutral country, which it is their joint wish to see.
They strongly hope, therefore, that the Soviet Union will make a positive and constructive reply to these proposals.
