    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 109, a short-term continuing resolution for FY 2001.
The Resolution provides 2001 appropriations for continuing projects and activities of the Federal Government through October 6, 2000, except for those funded by the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2001, and the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2001, which I have signed into law.
In February, I sent a budget to the Congress that funded critical investments in our future. We need realistic levels of funding for critical Government functions that the American people expect their Government to perform well, including education, law enforcement, environmental protection, preservation of our global leadership, air safety, food safety, economic assistance for the less fortunate, research and technology, administration of Social Security and Medicare, and other important programs. None of the funding bills for the programs that support these functions have been sent to the White House.
I urge the Congress to approve the 11 remaining 2001 spending bills as quickly as possible, in an acceptable form.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 29, 2000.
