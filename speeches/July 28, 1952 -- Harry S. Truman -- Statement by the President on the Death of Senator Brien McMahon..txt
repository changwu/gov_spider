    THE NATION has suffered a tremendous loss in the passing of one of its outstanding officials, Senator Brien McMahon.
Senator McMahon already had distinguished himself as a lawyer and judge before he went to Washington in the mid 1930's as an Assistant Attorney General. Seven years ago, in the midst of war, he became a United States Senator, a post in which he grew in stature with every passing year. It was as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that he made his greatest achievement. Senator McMahon was one of the first to see the fantastic possibilities for good in the wise use of atomic power. As he conceived it, the miracle of the release of atomic energy was intended for man's everlasting benefit--not his destruction. He worked tirelessly toward this end, and I am sure future generations will be grateful for his wisdom. I know I am grateful.
And beyond his statesmanship and his humanity, there was the man himself. I shall miss Brien McMahon because he was such a good friend.
