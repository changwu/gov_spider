    As Senegal's citizens go to the polls on February 26, we call on Senegalese authorities to uphold internationally-recognized electoral standards to ensure that these elections reflect the will of the Senegalese people.
We encourage all registered Senegalese voters to make their voices heard by casting their ballot, and to do so peacefully. We urge all political party leaders to lead by example, and encourage their supporters to respect the rights of their neighbors to express their will. We also call on all Senegalese, including security forces, to exercise restraint, and refrain from any violence. We regret the loss of life that has occurred, and we offer our condolences to the families and friends of those who have been lost.
We and others in the international community stand together in calling for free, fair, transparent, and peaceful elections in Senegal. The Senegalese people have come to deserve - and expect - nothing less.
