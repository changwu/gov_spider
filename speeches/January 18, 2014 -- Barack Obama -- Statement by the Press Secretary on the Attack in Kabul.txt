    The United States joins the international community in condemning the Taliban's attack on a restaurant in Kabul, Afghanistan, which has killed 21 civilians and injured others. We send condolences to all the victims of the attack and their families, and pray for a speedy recovery for those injured.
There is no possible justification for this attack, which has killed innocent civilians, including Americans, working every day to help the Afghan people achieve a better future with higher education and economic assistance at the American University, United Nations, International Monetary Fund and other organizations.
The United States commends the quick and skillful response of the Afghan security services in the aftermath of the attack. We call again on the Taliban to put down their arms and begin peace talks, which is the surest way to end the conflict in a peaceful manner.
