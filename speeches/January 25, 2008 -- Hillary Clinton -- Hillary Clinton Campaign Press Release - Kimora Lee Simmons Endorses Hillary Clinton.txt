    Fashion mogul, business entrepreneur, author, top model and mom Kimora Lee Simmons today endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. Simmons cited Clinton's ability to deliver real change for working families.
"I have known Hillary for many years and have seen her work passionately on many issues, including poverty, education, and prison reform," said Simmons. "I'm proud to support Hillary because she has the experience necessary to deliver real solutions and turn our country around. In addition, seeing Hillary as President would be an inspiration to my daughters, knowing that they too can be anything they want if they have the determination to make it happen. As a mother, I have learned that you must lead with your head, not just your heart, and I'm confident that Hillary will be the President to bring our country together and deliver a brighter future for all Americans."
