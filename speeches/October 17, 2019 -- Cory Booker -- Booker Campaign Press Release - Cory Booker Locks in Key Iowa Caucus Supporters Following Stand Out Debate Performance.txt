    Des Moines, IA - Following a stand out debate performance in which he showed voters once again why he is the best candidate in this race to defeat Donald Trump and heal our nation, Cory Booker locked in 18 new endorsements from key Iowa Caucus activists.
These activists join 56 other prominent Iowans, including State Representatives Kenan Judge, Jennifer Konfrst, Monica Kurth, Heather Matson, Amy Nielsen, and Mark Smith, in supporting Cory Booker's 2020 campaign.
"Cory's support in Iowa continues to consistently grow as more and more caucus goers get to know him as a leader who can bring people together to take on America's toughest problems," said Cory 2020 Iowa State Director Mike Frosolone. "We look forward to working with these hardworking Iowa activists to recruit even more support to our campaign. Today's endorsements represent yet another step towards victory on caucus day."
"Our nation is facing an epidemic of gun violence and I truly believe there are common-sense solutions to address this public health crisis. Senator Booker is the candidate with the most comprehensive gun safety proposal and the only candidate with a firearm suicide prevention plan. I'm ready for a leader who will model love and empathy, and work to unite our broken nation. That's why I'm proud to endorse Cory Booker for President," said Gun Violence Prevention Activist Rebecca Truszkowski. 
"When I hear Cory give a speech, I feel a profound hope that our nation's divisions can be healed. He worked with Democrats and Republicans alike on the landmark Criminal Justice reform that became law last year - a rare bipartisan victory. He treats his fellow Senators like fellow human beings, not as enemies to be destroyed. Before the February caucus, see Cory in person. His strength, compassion, and wisdom is what our nation needs to back away from the dark precipice and reconnect to our common humanity," said Jason Snell, Strategic Relations and Co-Director at Sunrise Movement Cedar Rapids.
