    The President spoke today with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to offer condolences for the deaths of two Danish citizens and the injuries of several others in the February 14 terrorist attacks in Copenhagen and to express American solidarity with our Danish allies. The two leaders agreed on the need to work together to confront attacks on freedom of expression as well as against anti-semitic violence. The President also welcomed Denmark's participation this week in the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism.
