    One year ago, in a terrorist attack launched from Yemen, two ballistic missiles and a series of drones targeted civilian sites in the United Arab Emirates. While the U.A.E.'s air defense systems—a hallmark of our decades-long security partnership—shot the missiles out of the sky, three innocent civilians died during this heinous attack.
Today we remember the lives that were so tragically lost, and we reaffirm the United States commitment to the safety and security of the Emirati people. Working in close cooperation with my friend President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the United States will continue to support the U.A.E. as it defends itself against threats, whether from Yemen or anywhere else. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of diplomacy to bring a peaceful end to the war in Yemen, and the United States will continue to support the security of the U.A.E. and our other partners in the Middle East, including providing needed military assistance. Therefore, as we commemorate the tragic events of 1 year ago, we stand resolute to ensure it cannot happen again.
As the U.A.E. prepares to host the world to address the climate challenge during COP-28 this fall, the United States and U.A.E. will continue our work to advance impactful new initiatives, like the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). Our strong partnership is critical to building a shared future of greater peace, stability, and integration throughout the region.
