    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Mineta (D) California and 76 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 1101, and the President's senior advisers will recommend that he veto the bill if it is presented to him for signature. H.R. 1101 would inappropriately subject most airline mergers to labor protection provisions (LPP's) which would be paid for by the airlines. The Secretary of Transportation already has sufficient authority to impose LPP's when they are warranted.
