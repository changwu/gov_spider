    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China Extending the Agreement of July 23, 1985, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with Annexes and Agreed Minutes, as amended and extended. This Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Beijing on June 6 and July 1, 1996, extends the 1985 Agreement to July 1, 1998.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the People's Republic of China, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
