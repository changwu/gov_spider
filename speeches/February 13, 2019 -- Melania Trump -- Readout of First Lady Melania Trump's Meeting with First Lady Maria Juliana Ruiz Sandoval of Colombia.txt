    First Lady Melania Trump joined President Donald J. Trump in welcoming President Ivan Duque Marquez and First Lady Maria Juliana Ruiz Sandoval of Colombia to the White House this afternoon.
Over lunch in the Red Room on the State Floor of the White House, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Ruiz Sandoval discussed the opioid crisis in the United States and the devastating impact it is having globally, especially on children and young mothers. In particular, Mrs. Trump addressed the drug addiction problems amongst youth within the United States, and the work she is doing through her initiative, Be Best, to raise awareness about the harmful effects substance abuse can have on the next generation.
"Last week I met with experts at the Office of National Drug Control Policy to learn more about the harmful effects of substance abuse and the steps we are taking to address this problem," said First Lady Melania Trump. "We must continue raising awareness so parents and communities can understand fully the harm that opioids are having on our children. My conversation with the First Lady of Colombia today further encouraged a global mission to fighting the addiction crisis and issues facing children domestically and all around the world."
