    Des Moines, Iowa – As polls show John Edwards gaining momentum in Iowa, New Hampshire and across the country, Senator Obama continues to make increasingly harsh, negative attacks against John Edwards - including today in Iowa. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, Iowa State Director for John Edwards for President, made the following statement:
"It's no coincidence that as John Edwards rises in the polls in Iowa, Senator Obama is resorting to harsh attacks. But Senator Obama's attacks can't hide the fact that for John Edwards, refusing PAC and Washington lobbyist money wasn't an election year conversion – it's something he's done from the beginning of his career. John Edwards is the only candidate with the courage and backbone to urge the Democratic Party to stop taking lobbyist contributions. If Senator Obama is serious about reform, he should join John Edwards in this challenge.
"John Edwards understands that if you give the powerful interests and Washington lobbyists a seat at the table, they'll eat all the food. That's why he helped lead the fight against insurance company lobbyists to get a Patients' Bill of Rights passed in the Senate."
