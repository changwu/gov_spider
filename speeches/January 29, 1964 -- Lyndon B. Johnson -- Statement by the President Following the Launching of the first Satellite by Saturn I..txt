    THE two-stage Saturn vehicle has just put into orbit the largest payload ever launched by any nation.
This is a giant step forward for the United States space effort.
We have now proved we have the capability for putting great payloads into space.
We have come a long way from the 31 pounds of Explorer 1 on January 31, 1958-to the some 37,000 pounds which has just been placed into orbit by Saturn 1.
We have demonstrated not only enormous boost capability, but we have proved the effectiveness and the practical use of liquid hydrogen as a rocket fuel for space flight.
As chairman of the Space Council for 3 years, I know first hand the hard work and creative energy that has gone into this achievement.
This successful launching and orbiting can accurately be described as one of the most important space science advances in our short but fruitful space history.
On behalf of a grateful and proud Nation, I warmly congratulate the scientists, technicians, managers, and employees of the space team for their contribution to peace and progress.
