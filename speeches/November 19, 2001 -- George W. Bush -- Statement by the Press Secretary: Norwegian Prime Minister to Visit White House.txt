    President Bush will welcome Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik for a meeting in the White House on December 5. The Norwegian people have demonstrated strong solidarity with America since the attack of September 11, and the Prime Minister's new government has continued the support of its predecessor in taking a number of concrete steps to help in the war on terrorism, both bilaterally and as a NATO ally. This visit will allow the President and Prime Minister to meet for the first time and to discuss the road ahead in this common challenge.
