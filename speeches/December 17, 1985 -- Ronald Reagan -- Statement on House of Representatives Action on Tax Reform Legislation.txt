    I want to express my heartfelt thanks to the bipartisan majority of Members of the House of Representatives who, by their vote this afternoon, have allowed tax reform to come before the House of Representatives. As heartened as I was by the vote on the rule, I will not relax until Congress has once and for all cast the final vote that will ensure true tax reform for the American people. Tonight there will be another step in that process. I want to urge all Members of both parties to send a bill on to the Senate, so they can finish the job when they return after Christmas.
