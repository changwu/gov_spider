HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced that South Carolina State Representative Wendy Nanney became the 500th member among state leadership teams he is building across the country. These groups include hundreds of county leaders, small business owners, Tea Party leaders, conservative and liberty activists, pastors, current and former legislators, and pro-life and pro-family leaders across the country. Now numbering more than 500 members across 17 states, Cruz by far leads the pack in the number of activists who have committed to support and work for a GOP presidential candidate.
"We need a leader that has a proven record of fighting for conservative principles and someone who will defend those Americans who have been hardest hit by this administration's disastrous policies," said Rep. Nanney, who was also tapped as a co-chair of Cruz's South Carolina Leadership Team. "That person is Ted Cruz and I am excited to be part of this team."
"I am thrilled by the outpouring of support we're seeing across the country," said Sen. Cruz. "With this team we are ready to compete and reignite the promise of America. We have leaders who will work to spread the message of consistent conservatism and stand up to career politicians in both parties and get us back to the principles upon which this nation was founded."
Cruz has built strong teams in each of the early primary and caucus states, as well as a number of states that will vote in the so-called "SEC primary" on March 1st. Cruz has already demonstrated the ability to raise the most "hard money" in the race, and is one of the only candidates to show positive movement in recent polls. Combined with his success in organizing teams across the country, Cruz is well-equipped to effectively compete for the long haul of the primary and into the general election.
