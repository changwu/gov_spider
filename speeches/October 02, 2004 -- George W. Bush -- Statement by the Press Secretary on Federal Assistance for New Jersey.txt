    The President yesterday declared a major disaster exists in the State of New Jersey and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by Tropical Depression Ivan beginning on September 18, 2004, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Hunterdon, Mercer, Sussex, and Warren.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Tropical Depression Ivan in the counties of Mercer, Sussex, and Warren.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures for the counties of Hunterdon, Mercer, Sussex, and Warren.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named Peter J. Martinasco as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
