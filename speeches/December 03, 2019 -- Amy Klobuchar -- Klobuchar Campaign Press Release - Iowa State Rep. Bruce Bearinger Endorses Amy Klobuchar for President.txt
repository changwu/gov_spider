    DES MOINES, IA — Iowa State Representative Bruce Bearinger today endorsed U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. Bearinger, who has represented House District 64 since 2013, cited Klobuchar's achievements in the Senate and bipartisan track record in announcing his support.
"Amy Klobuchar's track record of legislative success in Washington and electoral success in Minnesota is unmatched in the Democratic field. Amy understands that to win in 2020, and for the next President to govern successfully, our party has to reach out to voters who felt overlooked in 2016, particularly in rural America," said Iowa Representative Bruce Bearinger. "I believe her common-sense agenda — particularly on issues such as health care, education and agriculture — will resonate with a majority of Iowans and voters across the country. I'm proud to support her campaign and look forward to caucusing for her in February."
Bearinger, who previously supported Montana Governor Steve Bullock before his exit from the presidential race, has been a leader in the Iowa State House on issues including agriculture, infrastructure and investments in rural communities. As a former high school teacher, he has also been a longstanding advocate for better public schools.
To date, Klobuchar has the support of more current and former Iowa legislators than any other candidate in the field. She recently visited her 68th of the state's 99 counties and is set to make her 25th visit to the Hawkeye state later this week.
