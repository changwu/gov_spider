    Let me just say in the presence of the press here today that tonight my speech will be the basis of a heart-to-heart talk with the American people. There's no question but that drugs are the quicksand of our entire society. They're suffocating individuals and their families, and institutions as well, and all Americans must pull together to solve this problem.
And we have a national strategy, and I commend Bill Bennett [Director of National Drug Control Policy], who has coordinated this strategy, fathered a lot of it himself. And the entire Cabinet -- thank you for your cooperation. We must be in the forefront in helping solve this problem.
So, tonight I challenge the country and unveil this new national strategy -- the first time we really have had such a strategy. And I just wanted to thank everybody here who has been helping, working with Bill, in coming up with this strategy. Thank you all very much.
