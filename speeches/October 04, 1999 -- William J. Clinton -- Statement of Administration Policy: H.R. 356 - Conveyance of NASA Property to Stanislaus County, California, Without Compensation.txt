    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Condit (D) California)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 356. The bill would circumvent the statutory process for conveying surplus Federal property and, as a consequence, the Federal Government would not be compensated for the property. The property, known as the NASA Ames Research Center, Crows Landing Facility, consists of 1,528 acres. The property's value has been estimated at $6 million by the General Services Administration, which has initiated the process to dispose of the property in accordance with current law.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 356 would affect outlays; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget's preliminary estimate is that enactment of H.R. 356 would increase outlays by $6 million in FY 2002.
