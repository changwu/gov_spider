(Senate)
(Sen. Cochran, R-MS)
The Administration supports Senate passage of Senate Amendment 2689 to H.R. 719, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2016, and for other purposes. The Amendment allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption, providing a short-term bridge to give the Congress time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal year.
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on FY 2016 appropriations legislation for the full year that reverses sequestration, preserves funding for critical national priorities, protects national security, and makes investments to maintain economic growth and job creation for years to come.
