Vice President Biden and President Basescu agreed that NATO's collective defense planning needs to be comprehensive and responsive to threats that may emanate from NATO's east, south or southeast, and the two leaders exchanged views on their support and vision for NATO's Readiness Action Plan that will be agreed to at the Summit in Wales.
