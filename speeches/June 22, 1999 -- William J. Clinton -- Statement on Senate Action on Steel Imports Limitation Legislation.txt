    Today's vote is a reaffirmation of America's commitment to open markets, to a strong U.S. economy, and to vigorous enforcement of our trade laws. The surge in steel imports has created significant hardship for many steelworkers and communities. But quota legislation was the wrong approach and would have weakened our economy and undermined our ability to tear down unfair trade barriers in foreign countries that hurt our workers, farmers, and companies. We must and will continue vigorous enforcement of our trade laws. Our actions have already cut imports to pre-crisis levels. I will continue to work with workers, industry, and Members of Congress to attack unfair trade practices and subsidies around the world.
