    On Monday, Todd Palin, husband of former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, announced his endorsement of former Speaker Newt Gingrich in the presidential primary.  He released the following statement:
"Newt Gingrich is a true leader, which he has proven not only since the beginning of his campaign, but throughout his career.
"Just like Sarah, Newt has faced many successes and challenges. Despite his consultants leaving him last summer, Newt is still standing because of his ideas and his success in the debates – not by spending millions of dollars in campaign ads. From day one he has focused on how we can create jobs to get Americans back to work. This is a true testament to his leadership, commitment and hard work.
"As an Independent, I support Newt Gingrich for president because he has a proven record of getting things done, working with Republicans and Democrats, and America needs a leader like Newt right now."
