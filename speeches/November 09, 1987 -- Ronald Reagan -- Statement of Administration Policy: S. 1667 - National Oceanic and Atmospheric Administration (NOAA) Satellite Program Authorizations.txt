    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Hollings (D) South Carolina)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 1667 because it would (1) authorize FY 1988 appropriations for NOAA satellite and atmospheric programs which exceed the 1988 budget by $40.7 million; (2) prematurely authorize appropriations for FY 1989; and (3) impose restrictions on the Department of Commerce's ability to manage effectively the National Weather Service through closings or consolidations of offices.
