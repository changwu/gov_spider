    I applaud Speaker Gingrich for scheduling a vote in the House of Representatives for next Friday, November 7, on the renewal of traditional trade negotiating authority. I am grateful for his commitment to move forward and work to secure passage of this legislation that is vital to our national interest.
Renewal of traditional trade negotiating authority, which every President has had since 1974, will allow me to negotiate strong trade agreements that break down foreign barriers to our goods and services and directly benefit American workers and American companies. This authority represents a partnership between the President and the Congress in support of both American jobs and American leadership in the world today. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Speaker Gingrich and others in both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis to secure enactment of this legislation this year.
