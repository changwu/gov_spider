MITT ROMNEY: "Now, getting ready for my convention speech, I read some speeches from some other people who had spoken at conventions. I actually also read the inaugural speech of some of our great presidents and heroes in my life. And one of the speeches I read was the convention speech of Barack Obama. He was not one of the ones that I wanted to draw from, except I could not resist a couple of things he said, because he made a lot of promises. And I noted that he didn't keep a lot of promises. One of the promises he made was he was going to create more jobs, and today, 23 million people are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. Let me tell you, if you have a coach that's 0-23 million, you say it's time to get a new coach. It's time for America to see a winning season again and we're going to bring it to them."
