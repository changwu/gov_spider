FLOTUS pool report #4 - New Jersey remarks / 1 question leaving event 
Leaving the event, FLOTUS took one question from Molly Nagle:How does it feel to be back on the trail? "Great! We're gonna win this," Biden said.

From the event:
FLOTUS began speaking at Middlesex County College at 4:23 pm. Bon Jovi's Living on a Prayer played briefly as she took the stage.
A few quick quotes—
"I want you to imagine yourself, a year from now. So think about it, there's two possibilities. In one, in the first one, New Jersey is really fighting the battles we should have already won."
"You see other states spend federal money to invest in education and healthcare and new jobs. New Jersey just slips behind and you're wondering, what more could I have done, what could I have done to stop this. What if I had made one more call or knocked on one more door. That's one view."
"The other view is looking forward. You trust that your roads and your bridges are getting safer every day, like fighting the climate crisis, making health care affordable and putting working families first."
"So which future do you want, because we're deciding it right now."
"Let's not wonder what we could have done, let's be proud of what we did."
"Tell them to vote early. Go grab a cup of coffee and go vote."
Dr. Biden then ad-libbed a line about getting a beer: "So go grab a beer and go vote."
FLOTUS finished speaking at 4:33 pm. It's My Life resumed playing and Dr. Biden was joined on stage by Gov. Murphy, Lt. Gov. Oliver, and Tammy Murphy who clapped along to the song for a couple of minutes.

**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenMurphy for GovernorEdison, New JerseyOctober 15, 2021
***Thank you, Phil. I'm so excited to be here today! While you know I'm a Philly Girl, I was born here in New Jersey—so I'm glad to be back here in my other home state!
Tammy, there's a small group of people who know what it's like to be a political spouse. But you also know what it's like to uproot your family to Germany and serve alongside Phil when he was Ambassador to Germany.
These are roles you may not have chosen, but you've used your platform to represent our country with grace and strength, and serve the people of New Jersey. I'm proud to see what you've done throughout the years and even more proud to call you and Phil our friends.
I also want to thank Congressman Frank Pallone and all the elected officials with us today.
I'm here to ask you to re-elect Phil Murphy as your Governor. He's used this office to lead New Jersey through one of the darkest times in modern history.
And Joe and I know Phil. We know that he's going to fight for you and your family every day. Joe is honored to serve as your President and grateful for the trust you've given him. He's working hard for you. That's why he needs a partner like Phil working beside him to build on the progress we've already made.You know that. That's why you're here today.***So for just a moment, I want you to imagine yourself one year from now. And there are two possibilities.
In one, New Jersey is re-fighting battles we should have already won, like defending women's health and common-sense gun safety laws. Or we're fighting tax cuts for the wealthiest among us.You're seeing other states use federal money to invest in education and health care and new jobs—while New Jersey slips behind. You're wondering: What more could we have done to stop this? What if I had made one more call or knocked on one more door?
And in the other future, you're looking forward. You trust that your roads and bridges are getting safer every day because Governor Murphy is putting money where it needs to go.
You're excited to see what your children can do when we invest in their schools. You rest easier at night, knowing that New Jersey is fighting the climate crisis, making health care affordable, and putting working families first. And you know that the best is yet to come.
Which future do you want? Because we're deciding it right now. This election will set a course for a year from now, and two years from now, and on and on.***As I wrap up, I want to thank all of you for your support. It's because of your hard work that Joe is President and we've been able to make so much progress already—helping working families across the country.
But we can't get complacent. We have to get to work.
So, I'm asking you to vote—for Phil Murphy and Democrats up and down the ballot.
That way we can protect our majority in the State Legislature and elect Sheila Oliver as Lieutenant Governor.
If you have a mail-in-ballot at home, fill it out and send it in today! If not, early voting starts October 23rd—so make a plan. Don't wait.
Talk to your family and friends about why this election matters. Tell them how to vote early. Go with them! Grab a cup of coffee and go vote! Run errands and go vote! And then sign up to make some texts or knock on doors! We have a little more than two weeks before election day. We need every single vote we can get.
Because that person you call… the friend you remind to vote… the coworker you convince to support Phil…they could be the vote that decides your precinct. And your precinct could be the one that tips the county in our favor. And county by county, we will win this.
***
New Jersey needs to move forward, not backwards. We need to look toward the future, not the past.
Let's not wonder what we could have done—let's be proud of what we did—right now.
It takes all of us, coming together, doing our part—today and tomorrow and every day until we win on November 2nd. We can do this! Let's re-elect hil Murphy.

FLOTUS pool report #8 - Rep. Spanberger 
Rep. Abigail Spanberger began speaking at 7:04 pm, standing before a bank of hay bales. We're in Spanberger's district, CD 7. She was not on the program provided to your pooler.
Spanberger spoke for about 4 mins, tearing into Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin over a controversial rally attended by his running mate, Winsome Sears.
Some quick quotes:
"Now it does not matter to me that he wasn't at that event, which has been the excuse. What matters to me is that I want to hear an unequivocal denunciation of the fact that anyone would celebrate an insurrection and the defiling of our flag, the symbol of our very freedom."
She also touted President Biden's Build Back Better agenda, including funding for broadband internet and childcare.
Spanberger finished speaking at 7:08 pmbefore introducing Va. House of Delegates member Hala Ayala, who is running for Lt. Governor.

FLOTUS began speaking at 7:31 pm.
A group of rough a dozen environmental protestors interrupted Dr. Biden numerous times beginning at about 7:32 pm. They held a sign that read "Reject Pipelines, Protect the Future."
Counter protestors attempted to drown them out, chanting "Terry."
The protestors were ushered out at 7:36 pmwith a chant that sounded like "Don't pump oil, leave it in the soil." But it was hard to hear.
FLOTUS finished speaking at 7:39 pm. Motorcade rolling to Richmond International Airport at 7:51 pm.
Some quotes:
"It's so great to stand here with Virginia's former and future first lady. First lady is not a role that we necessarily choose and I know what it's like to have a husband who has 10 ideas for how to change the world before you even get that first cup of coffee in the morning. But I also know that this platform is an honor and a privilege that we both cherish."
"One year ago, I was not far from here sitting with a handful of moms, and they talked about how frustrated they were about, guess what, all the things that were out of control. Schools closing, growing divisions in our communities. But they were hopeful too. They told me that they had faith in Joe Biden."
"Virginia needs someone who will work towards progress, not refight the battles of our past, […] education, and make prescription drugs affordable."
"We know Terry. We know his values, we know his heart. He's worked with Republicans to make investments in education, improve transportation and strengthen your workforce. He knows how to bring people together, because that's the only way to get things done."

**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenMcAuliffe for GovernorRichmond New JerseyOctober 15, 2021
***Thank you, Terry.
Dorothy, it's so great to stand here with Virginia's former and future first lady.
First lady is not a role that we necessarily choose—and I know what it's like to have a husband who has ten ideas for how to change the world before you've even had your first cup of coffee.
But I also know that this platform is an honor and a privilege we both cherish. So, I am excited to see what you'll do next.
Also, our friend, Anne Holton, is here with us—Anne, it's great to see you again.
Thank you to all the elected officials standing with us tonight.
***I love this energy! And I know the excitement all of you are feeling starts with Terry, doesn't it?
Terry, when you're around, it's impossible not to feel optimistic.
Almost one year ago, I was not far from here, sitting with a handful of moms.
And they talked about how frustrated they felt about all the things that were out of their control.
The pandemic … schools closing … growing divisions in our communities.
But they were hopeful too.
They told me that they had faith that Joe Biden could change the course of our country so we could breathe again. And they knew that there was one thing they could control: working to get him elected.
They were right. When we elected Joe, he made sure that families had a rescue plan—and they were able to take more control over their own lives.
We got people vaccinated. We sent out checks to help them through the crisis. We made sure kids could safely get back to school and parents could get back to work.
With Joe's leadership, we've made progress across the country—and he worked hand-in-hand with Governor Northam to make sure Virginia received the help it needed. And, we're just getting started. We have so much more work to do together.***Virginia needs someone who will work toward progress, not re-fight the battles of our past.
Virginia, you need someone you can trust.
That's Terry. You know that because you know Terry.
He has a bold vision to recover from the pandemic, invest in education, and make prescription drugs affordable.
He has a proven track record — remember, unemployment fell in every city and county in the commonwealth when he was governor.
And, like Joe, Terry understands that it's not enough to have good ideas—you have to bring people together and deliver on your promises.
The closer we get to Election Day, the more misinformation we hear. There are a lot of people who like to twist words around.
But we know Terry. We know his values and his heart.
He worked with Republicans to make investments in education, improve transportation, and strengthen your workforce.
He knows how to bring people together—because that's the only way to get things done.***So today, I'm asking you to vote—for Terry McAuliffe and Democrats up and down the ballot.
Let's protect our majority in the House of Delegates and make Hala Ayala your next Lieutenant Governor.
Don't wait. Vote early!
November 2nd will be here before you know it.
Then, encourage your family and friends to vote early. Every single vote matters… that friend you remind to vote… the coworker you convince to support Terry…they could be the vote that decides your precinct. And your precinct could be the one that tips the county in our favor. And county by county, we will win this.
It takes all of us, coming together, doing our part—today and tomorrow and every day until we win on November 2nd. We can do this Virginia! Let's get to work and elect Terry McAuliffe as your next governor.
