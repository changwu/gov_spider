Fox News' Major Garrett: "Edwards: Looks Crisp and Confident and Has Clearly Honed His Populist Message." "Edwards: Looks crisp and confident and has clearly honed his populist message about the role of corporate influence on American political life, his line 'corporate power and greed have literally taken over the government,' will stand as one of the punchiest of the day and crystallizes his campaign theme. His fumbling of his desire that this generation leave the nation in better shape than it was found left a humanizing and humorous feeling in the air."

Marc Ambinder: "But Who Did Best?... On Balance, Clinton and Edwards." "But who did best?... On balance, Clinton and Edwards.... Why them, and not Obama?

NBC/NJ's Carrie Dann: "He Knows His Iowa Audience."
2:43 PM "Edwards named the closing of the Maytag plant in Newton as the ultimate illustration of how corporate America is hurting the middle class. It was an emotional and much-publicized event for plant workers here in Iowa, prompting cathartic displays such as the public demolition of a washing machine. Edwards visited Newton, Iowa, the week of the plant's closing. The crowd hit hardest by the factory buyout is the one with which Edwards' anti-corporate populism resonates the most. He knows his Iowa audience." [http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/12/13/514608.aspx]

TAPPED's Dana Goldstein: "Edwards Is Great On Education." "Edwards Is Great On Education:" "I'm always impressed with John Edwards' discussions of education policy during these debates. He begins with the importance of early childhood interventions, he criticizes NCLB while holding out hope it can be reformed, and he highlights the privileges suburban schools enjoy that rural and inner city schools lack. He circles back to discuss free college tuition for qualified high school graduates."
