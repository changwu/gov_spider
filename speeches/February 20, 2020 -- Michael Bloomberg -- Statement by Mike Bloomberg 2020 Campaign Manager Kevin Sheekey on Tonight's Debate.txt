    "You know you are a winner when you are drawing attacks from all the candidates. Everyone came to destroy Mike tonight. It didn't happen. Everyone wanted him to lose his cool. He didn't do it. He was the grownup in the room.
"Tonight, Mike Bloomberg presented himself as the leading alternative to Bernie Sanders. Everyone came to get under Mike's skin, but instead, Mike got under Bernie's. Mike delivered the line of the night to Senator Sanders: 'What a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.'
"It took Mike just 3 months to build a stronger campaign than the rest of the field had built in more than a year. It took him just 45 minutes in his first debate in 10 years to get his legs on the stage.
"He was just warming up tonight. We fully expect Mike will continue to build on tonight's performance when he appears on the stage in South Carolina next Tuesday."
