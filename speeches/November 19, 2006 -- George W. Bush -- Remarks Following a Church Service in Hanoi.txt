    Laura and I just had a moment to converse with God in a church here in Hanoi. We were touched by the simplicity and the beauty of the moment. We appreciate very much the congregation for allowing us to come and worship with them.
A whole society is a society which welcomes basic freedoms, and there's no more basic freedom than the basicâ€”the freedom to worship as you see fit. And Laura and I were proud to worship with believers here in Hanoi. And we, again, thank the church for the opportunity to come by. My hope is that people all across the world will be able to express religion [religious] * freedom. And it's our way of expressing our personal faith and, at the same time, urging societies to feel comfortable with and confident in saying to their people, if you feel like praising God, you're allowed to do so in any way you see fit.
God bless, and thank you.
