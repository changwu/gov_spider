    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of former Senator Edmund Muskie. A dedicated legislator and caring public servant, Senator Muskie was a leader in the best sense. He spoke from his heart and acted with conviction. Generations to come will benefit from his steadfast commitment to protecting the land.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his friends, and the people of Maine at this difficult time.
