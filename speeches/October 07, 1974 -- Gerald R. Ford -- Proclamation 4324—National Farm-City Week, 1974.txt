  A Proclamation

The two hundred years which have passed since America's birth has witnessed a dramatic change in our society. From a primarily rural nation, we have grown to a country of great cities and towns, and farmers now make up less than five percent of our national population.
As we have learned from our recent food shortages, however, the cities have not lost their fundamental dependence upon the farms for the basics in life. Nor are our farms any less dependent upon our urban centers for their products and services.
There is, indeed, a continuing partnership, often recognized but little honored. It is that partnership we must build upon to achieve a new abundance and prosperity in the future.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 22 through November 28, 1974 as National Farm-City Week.
I invite our civic and business groups, our agricultural organizations, our service clubs, our labor unions, our schools and other interested groups to participate in this observance. I request the United States Department of Agriculture, our land-grant educational institutions, and all appropriate organizations and Government officials to mark the significance of National Farm-City Week with special events and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.

GERALD R. FORD
