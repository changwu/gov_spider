    Today, the White House released a report on the health impacts of climate change on Americans. The report summarizes the ways that climate change will be felt across the Nation.
In the past three decades, the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled, and climate change is putting those Americans at greater risk of landing in the hospital. And extreme weather events are becoming more frequent across the country - from more rain falling in downpours in many regions, to longer and hotter heat waves in others, to more severe droughts and wildfires in some (notably the West and Southwest).
The effects of climate change impact the most vulnerable Americans - putting the elderly, kids, and people already suffering from burdensome allergies, asthma and other illnesses at greater risk.
The President believes we have a moral obligation to leave our children a planet that's not irrevocably polluted or damaged. While no single step can reverse the effects of climate change, we must take steady, responsible action to cut carbon pollution, protect our children's health, and begin to slow the effects of climate change so that we leave behind a cleaner, more stable environment. That's why the President put forward the Climate Action Plan last year and earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency released a vital component of that plan - common-sense carbon pollution standards for existing power plants.
Through common-sense measures to cut carbon pollution we can protect the health of our Nation, while stimulating the economy and helping to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.
