    The American people congratulate the people of the Republic of the Philippines on the successful conclusion of their presidential election. The Philippines has again demonstrated the strength of its democracy. A Joint Session of the Philippine Congress officially proclaimed on June 23 that Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had won the election, concluding a constitutional process that began with polling on May 10. We congratulate President Arroyo on her victory.
We understand that some participants in the political process have raised questions about the results of the May 10 election. We commend the people of the Philippines for making use of established legal mechanisms and rejecting extra-legal options for resolving their differences.
The United States and the Philippines have long maintained deep bonds of friendship. The Government of the Philippines under President Macapagal-Arroyo has been a strong leader and a steadfast ally in the global war on terrorism. We greatly appreciate its contribution to the international effort to build a peaceful, free, and independent Iraq. We look forward to strengthening our close cooperation with the Government of the Philippines on these and other efforts to ensure the security and prosperity of our peoples.
