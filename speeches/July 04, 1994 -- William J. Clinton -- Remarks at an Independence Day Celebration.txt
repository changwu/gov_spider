    The President. Hello. Happy Fourth of July. Let me just say, part of this wonderful celebrationâ€”can you hear?
Audience members. Yes.
The President. Part of this wonderful celebration is music, fireworks, family, friends, no speeches. But I just want to welcome you here tonight and say what an immense pleasure and pride it is for Hillary and for me to have you here. We hope you enjoy the fireworks. We're proud to have you here on the grounds of your house and hope that you feel it is your house.
And let me just say one little thing seriously. Every Fourth of July, I try to take a little time to think about what this country means in a special way. And today, I finished a biography I've been reading of our second President, John Adams. He's the first person who ever lived in this house, in 1800. He died on the 50th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence, on July the 4th, 1826, the same day President Jefferson died. They were great friends. And they died, on the same day, as they had lived: loving this country. And what I want to ask all of you to think about is what we can do to make sure that this country's still here 200 years from now. That's our job.
Thank you. God bless you. Have a great night.
