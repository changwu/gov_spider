    Last week, the Senate began floor consideration of the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada's nomination was first submitted to the Senate in May 2001â€” almost 2 years ago. Miguel Estrada is a well-qualified and well-respected nominee who enjoys the bipartisan support of a majority of Senators. Fairness demands that he receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. I urge the Senate to act quickly and allow for an up-or-down vote on this worthy candidate.
