    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today made the following statement regarding the National Day of Prayer:
"Today, in communities across this nation, Americans of all faiths will join together in prayer as part of the National Day of Prayer. In big cities and small towns, millions of Americans pray each day to give thanks for life's blessings and to have the strength to face the challenges ahead. At this time when our military men and women are serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and across the world, we also pray for their continued safety. On this day, we recognize the power that prayer has had in our lives and the life of our country."
