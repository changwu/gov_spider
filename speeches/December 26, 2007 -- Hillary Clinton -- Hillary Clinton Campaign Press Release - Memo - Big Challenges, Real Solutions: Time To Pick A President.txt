    As Iowans prepare to gather to pick a President on January 3rd, one central question should be on their minds:
"Who would be the best president?"
America faces a war abroad and a troubled economy at home -- critical moments that demand a President who is tested, ready to lead on Day 1 and offers real solutions to the big challenges we face. And that person is Hillary Clinton.
That's the message Hillary will be carrying throughout Iowa as she embarks today on a nine day swing in the lead up to the caucuses. She begins the tour in Mt. Pleasant with President Bill Clinton, Governor Tom Vilsack, and Christie Vilsack. She will also make stops in Pella, IA and Cumming, IA.
Throughout the trip, Hillary is going to talk about her 35 years of making change happen â€“ from protecting kids from abuse, to reforming education in Arkansas, to helping get health care for six million children and for our nation's reservists and guardsmen.
Change isn't something you just demand or hope for, it is something you work for and Hillary has been working for it all her life.
In the White House, she will rebuild the middle class, curb the influence of the special interests and restore this country to greatness. She will end the war, get healthcare for every American and renew our energy future.
It will be a new beginning for all of us.
She has the track record of strength, experience and change that the times demand which is why the Des Moines Register and Quad-City Times have joined the growing number of Iowans supporting her.
They believe she will make the best President and because they believe she will win. She has stood up to the Republicans and beaten them twice in landslides and next November she will inspire millions to come out and participate in the process to make history November 2008.
There are eight days to go until the Iowa Caucuses:
It's time to pick a president.
