    MRS. OBAMA: This is your surprise baby shower. (Laughter.) We know how much you guys do for us. And we know that it's even more challenging for you guys who are expecting. And many of you -- all of you have your loved one deployed or about to be deployed, right?
And there's a team of people who are responsible for putting this shower together for you, and I just want to make sure that you know who's involved in this. Operation Shower -- I know some of you heard about this -- but Operation Shower puts on showers for military moms all over the country, and this is the first-ever overseas shower that they've done. So they're a part of this.
But in addition to Operation Shower, we have GLAM4GOOD, who is going to -- because you see -- (laughter) -- it's not just about the babies. (Laughter.) I don't know if you saw this. (Laughter.) But GLAM4GOOD, Carousel Designs, and Birdies for the Brave are also here to help you guys do a little makeover.
We've got the glam squad here, some of the best in New York. Some of the best fashion advisors and stylists are here to help you with some great stuff. And just for the record, I know that there are a lot more expectant mothers on base, and we're going to make sure that everyone on base gets an Operation Shower box, okay?
But, you guys, we're getting you some special things here, because we want you to know that we've got your backs while you're going through this part of your lives. You're not alone, all right?
We love you guys. Enjoy this time.
