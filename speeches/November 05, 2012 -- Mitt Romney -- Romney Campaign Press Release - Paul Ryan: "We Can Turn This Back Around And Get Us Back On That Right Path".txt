PAUL RYAN: "And the point is, we're at an inflection point. Not only is the path that we are on damaging our economy, making it harder for people to get ahead, keeping people out of the middle class, making our paychecks stretch less far than it ever has before because of energy prices, because of everything else. But we know without a doubt that we are giving this next generation a diminished future. We have never done that in this country before. This country has always been truthful to the American legacy of leaving the next generation better off. We know now, without a shadow of a doubt, that if we stay on this path, this mountain of debt, this crushing burden of borrowing and spending and taxing and regulating and money printing -- we know that it will give our kids a lower living standard. We've never done that before. Here's the good news, we also know that that doesn't work. We know that freedom works. We know that free enterprise works. We know that the genius and the nucleus of our economy and our society is our families, our small businesses, the people of this country and not our government. And we've got to get those priorities right. And when we win, we can turn this back around and get us back on that right path."
