    Chicago, IL - Senator Barack Obama released the following statement this morning on the resignation of HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson:
"Secretary Jackson's resignation amid a housing crisis and charges of cronyism serves as a stark reminder of what's at stake in this election. It's harder than ever for working families to achieve the American Dream, and that's why we need a president who will cut ties with the special interests so that we can implement a plan that provides real relief to homeowners and prevents the lobbyists from writing the laws that regulate them. I've proposed a plan to create a new FHA Housing Security Program, create a new mortgage interest tax credit, fight mortgage fraud, and create a $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund. And on my first day in office, I'll introduce the most sweeping ethics reform in history, keeping industry insiders out of the regulation process and taking away the tools that the special interests use to curry favor. After nearly eight years of failed policies, rampant favoritism, and inaction in the face of crisis, that's the kind of leadership that America needs," said Senator Obama.
