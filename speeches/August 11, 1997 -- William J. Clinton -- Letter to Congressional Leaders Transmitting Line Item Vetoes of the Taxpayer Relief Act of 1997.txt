    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel two limited tax benefits, as specified in the attached reports, contained in the "Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997" (Public Law 105- 34; H.R. 2014). I have determined that each of these cancellations will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, together with its attachments, constitutes a special message under section 1022 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
