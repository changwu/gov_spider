    Hey, guys! What's going on? How's everybody doing? Hello, everybody! Hello, hello, hello! Good to see you. Mark, good to see you. Nice to meet you.
So I'm not going to make a long speech right now. I've got to speak in the other room, and I hope you guys will be able to hear it.
I just want to say how proud I am of all of you. You guys are doing great in school. I want to shake some hands. I expect everybody here to keep working hard. How many seniors here? How many juniors? Sophomores? [Applause] All right. Sophomores. Freshmen. Okay, well, the sophomores--the juniors and the seniors, I know they're working hard because they're starting to apply to college. Sophomores, you still got a lot of time, so you guys got to stay focused. All right? All right. But I'm expecting everybody here to go to college, everybody here to succeed. And I appreciate you guys very much. I'm just going to shake as many hands as I can.
