Script for "Super Bowl":
Voice Over: "With pundits and politicos handicapping the campaign like the Super Bowl, it's easy to lose sight of what's at stake. An economy in peril. A country at war. A future uncertain. The media loves process. Talking heads love chatter. But Florida has a chance to turn down the noise. And show the world that leadership is what really matters."
Mayor Giuliani: "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approved this message."
