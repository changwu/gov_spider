    Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus Xavier Becerra released the following statement on Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's surprise appearance at the GOP Convention:"Sheriff Joe Arpaio's twisted values reflect what America is not: divisive and hateful. Arpaio also represents the future we would face if Donald Trump were in the White House. Like Arpaio, Trump has promised to deport DREAMers and their families. Like Arpaio, Trump degrades hardworking immigrants, calling them 'drug dealers,' 'rapists' and 'murderers.' Trump's message to America is that you should be afraid â€“ afraid of people who look different, who speak a different language or who were born in a different country.
"Immigrant families, and all American families, deserve a president who will fight to keep families together, work to ensure everyone is treated with respect, and who will build our country up. Only one candidate gets that: Hillary Clinton."
