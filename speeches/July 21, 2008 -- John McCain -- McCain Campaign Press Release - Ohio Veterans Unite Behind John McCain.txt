    COLUMBUS, OH -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Ohio Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Ohio's veterans' community.
"As a young American and Iraq war veteran, I am inspired by Senator McCain's record of always putting country first," said Ohio State Rep. and Ohio Veterans for McCain Co-Chair Josh Mandel. "Challenging times call for leaders who inspire our youth, motivate our troops and put the best interest of our country before all else. In this election, that leader is clearly John McCain."
State Rep. Josh Mandel served as an Intelligence Specialist in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, having graduated first in his class from Marine Corps Boot Camp and first in his class from Marine Corps Intelligence School. His Marine Corps duty includes two tours in Iraq, where he operated throughout the Al Anbar Province.
"John McCain stood strong with his fellow POWs by refusing early release from prison in North Vietnam, and he will continue to stand strong for our troops and veterans as Commander in Chief," said Ohio Veterans for McCain Chair Colonel Tom Moe. "While Barack Obama is overseas, he can thank John McCain for ensuring the success of the surge strategy that has made Iraq a safer place today. We are pleased that Barack Obama will see for himself for the very first time just how misguided his opposition to the surge was, and we hope he will admit his mistake in judgment."
Colonel Tom Moe retired from the Air Force in 1995. He was shot down and captured by the North Vietnamese in January 1968. Like Sen. McCain, Col. Moe refused early release from the "Hanoi Hilton." After returning to the United States, Col. Moe earned his master's degree in international relations from Notre Dame University, where he later served, having completed his lengthy service as a fighter pilot, as professor of aerospace studies and commander of the Air Force ROTC program.
