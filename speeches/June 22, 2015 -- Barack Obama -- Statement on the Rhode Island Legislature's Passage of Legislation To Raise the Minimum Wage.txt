    I commend the Rhode Island Legislature and Governor Raimondo for once again taking action to raise their State's minimum wage. Since I first called on Congress to increase the Federal minimum wage in 2013, 17 States have acted on their own, which will grow the paychecks of millions of American workers. Many private companies have acted as well, recognizing that paying workers fairly is both good for business and the right thing to do. This year, more than half of our States guarantee their workers a wage higher than the Federal minimum. But despite this progress, we still have work to do. I continue to encourage States, cities, counties, and companies to lift their workers' wages, and I urge Congress to finally do the right thing and give America a raise.
