  A Proclamation

There are today more than 30 million living veterans of the United States Armed Forces whose military service to their Nation has significantly influenced the role of the United States in world affairs.
During Fiscal Year 1979, approximately 1.3 million of these men and women were hospitalized in the 172 Veterans Administration medical centers across the country. A similar number will be admitted for care and treatment this year and in the years to come.
In order to encourage a continuing awareness of the service and sacrifice of these Americans, I urge citizens of all ages to participate in their communities in honoring our sick and disabled hospitalized veterans. I believe it essential that we do as much as possible to express our collective appreciation to the many hospitalized men and women who have served this Nation faithfully.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 14, 1981, as "National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans' Day." I invite all of our citizens to join with me in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.

JIMMY CARTER
