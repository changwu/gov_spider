    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rostenkowski (D) Illinois)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1430 and urges its prompt enactment.
Current estimates indicate that the Treasury will run out of cash and room under the existing $4,145 billion debt limit on April 7th, absent extraordinary actions. Enactment of an expansion in the debt limit is necessary before then to avoid disruptions in Treasury borrowing and unnecessary uncertainty in the financial markets.
