The Chicago Tribune: Joe Biden for sensible Democratic leadership
"From Texas to Maine. They settled on Biden. These voters are Democrats choosing the more sensible candidate for their party's nomination. They also believe he can more easily beat Trump in the fall, and that's a key calculus for Democratic voters."
"For Illinois voters and for moderate Midwesterners casting Democratic ballots during the next three weeks, Biden is the best fit. His 30-year record in the Senate is solidly pro-union and pro-public education. He has supported pathways to citizenship, campaign finance reform and gun control measures."
"Biden's long tenure on the Senate's Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees always has given him an edge in foreign policy. It was largely the reason Obama picked him as his running mate in 2008â€¦ he had a good line about the value of experience in international affairs: "If you're not capable of being secretary of state, are you capable of being president?"
"But he's a more centrist Democrat who stands a better chance of winning crucial Midwestern states to secure the nomination and possibly the presidency. Democrats during the next round of primaries and caucuses will set the direction of the party nationally: Will they tilt toward the moderate agendas that elected Democrats Bill Clinton and Obama? "
"For the Illinois primary, the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board endorses Joe Biden."
