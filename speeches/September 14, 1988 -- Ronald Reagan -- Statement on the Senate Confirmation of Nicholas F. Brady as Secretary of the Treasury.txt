    I am extremely pleased that the Senate has voted to confirm my nomination of Nicholas F. Brady to be the Secretary of the Treasury, succeeding James A. Baker III.
Nick Brady has served as the United States Senator from New Jersey and has been a leader in the investment community. I cannot imagine anyone more qualified to step in as Treasury Secretary. Now that he has been confirmed by the Senate, he will become the chief economic spokesman for my administration. Nick's sure hand at the helm will ensure the steady continuation of the economic policies that have brought about the longest economic recovery in our history and job opportunities that have resulted in the lowest unemployment rate in 14 years.
I am confident that Nick Brady will serve the Department and his country well. I look forward to having a full Cabinet once the Senate has confirmed my nominee for Secretary of Education, Lauro Cavazos.
