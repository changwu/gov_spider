    [The following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery today by Senator Fred Thompson to the Republican Jewish Coalition 2008 Presidential Candidate's Forum in Washington, D.C.:]
"The terror masters in Tehran and Damascus make only the most minor distinction between America and Israel. They say that America is the Great Satan, and Israel is the Little Satan, and both must be destroyed. They organized the assassination of Lebanese political leaders, and turned that aspiring democracy into a hostage state.
"The US must make it clear that we will not allow Iran to become a nuclear threat. In addition to pursuing sanctions and other traditional means, we need to take other steps to reach out to the Iranian people and help them get rid of their hated regime.
"In these efforts, we need the help of our traditional allies in Europe and Asia. We need the assistance of friendly Arab states in the region. And maybe most importantly, we urgently need the active involvement of moderate Muslims and religious leaders to wrest back their faith, and indeed their peoples, from this cult of death.
"Our goal is peace and freedom. The US must willingly accept its accustomed role of leadership in this effort. Our nation is steeped in the tradition of honor and sacrifice for the greater good. We will stay with that tradition, with the faith that nothing less than the security of our nation and all those who value freedom depend upon it."
