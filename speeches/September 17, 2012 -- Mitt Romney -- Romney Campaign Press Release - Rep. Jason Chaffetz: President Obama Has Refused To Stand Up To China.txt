    Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz today made the following statement on President Obama's failure to stand up to China:  
"For more than 100 years, the United States led the world in manufacturing. But under President Obama, we've lost our position — not to mention hundreds of thousands of jobs — to China, a country President Obama has repeatedly refused to stand up to. Mitt Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will not only stand up to cheaters like China, but it will restore the strength of our economy, get our country's fiscal house in order, and create jobs for American workers."
