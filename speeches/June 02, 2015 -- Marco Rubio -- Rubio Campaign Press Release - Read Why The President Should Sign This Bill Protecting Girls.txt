    
The House passed the 'Girls Count Act' I sponsored with Sen. Shaheen and it's now heading to the President's desk for signature.
This bill puts us one step closer to ensuring that every child is acknowledged by birth records in order to protect them from exploitation and human trafficking.
I encourage the President to sign this bill into law so we can reinforce our commitment to protecting the vulnerable and the oppressed.
