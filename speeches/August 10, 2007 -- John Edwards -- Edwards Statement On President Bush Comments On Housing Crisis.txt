    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement responding to President Bush's comments yesterday refusing to help homeowners victimized by abusive, predatory mortgages.
"George Bush may not have noticed it, but everyone else - including the markets - has. We have a housing crisis on our hands. It's time for the president to show real leadership and stop protecting irresponsible lenders. Because of President Bush's failures, millions of American families are at risk of losing their home and everything they've worked for. The president must stop blaming homeowners, and wake up and realize that our nation's economy has been put at severe risk by irresponsible corporations.
"Unlike President Bush, rather than ignore the serious issue of hard-working Americans losing their homes, I have called for a national Home Rescue Fund and bankruptcy reforms to help families prevent foreclosure and get out of toxic loans. And as president, I will enact strong national predatory lending legislation so that this never happens again."
