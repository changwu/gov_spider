    I AM deeply concerned by the serious threats to New England's shoreline, wildlife, marine resources, and fishing industry, posed by the oil spill off the coast of southeastern Massachusetts.
I have directed Federal agencies to do all that is possible to contain the slick, to limit environmental damage, and to provide appropriate assistance under the law to any affected communities and businesses.
The Coast Guard continues to take all possible measures to ensure minimal economic and ecological damage. Representatives of the Economic Development Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are on the scene and are monitoring the situation closely. They are prepared, at my direction, to respond as promptly as possible and to exercise every appropriate authority at their disposal to assist in dealing with this unfortunate accident.
