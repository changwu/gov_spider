    President Carter is sending a special flight to Nicaragua on Saturday, July 28, to deliver emergency food and medical supplies. The U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, will return to Managua on Saturday's flight. He will present his credentials to the new Government of Nicaragua early next week. The President is sending this special plane as an expression of his personal good will to the people of Nicaragua and to the new Government and to symbolize the concern of Americans for the hunger and distress of the Nicaraguan people after many months of devastating conflict.
The United States has already provided 732 metric tons of emergency food supplies to Nicaragua. Another 1,000 tons of food from the United States is on its way to Nicaragua by ship. In addition, the United States is providing supplies and financial assistance for airlifts being carried out by the international committee of the Red Cross. Of 9,600 pounds of medical supplies purchased by the U.S. Government for shipment to Nicaragua, 75 percent has already been delivered, and the remaining 2,500 pounds of U.S. purchased medicines, together with 3,300 pounds of Red Cross medical supplies and 5,200 pounds of baby formula, are arriving in Nicaragua this weekend on a special flight chartered by the Agency for International Development.
