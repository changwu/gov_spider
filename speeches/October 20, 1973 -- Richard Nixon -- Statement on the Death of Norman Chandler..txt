    A CLOSE FRIEND, a worthy citizen, and an honest, forthright leader in the communications field, Norman Chandler will be missed by all Americans.
His good works and his newspaper will serve as monuments to his life, but his personal qualities--his warmth, dignity, and devotion to others--will not be easily replaced. I will always remember him as one of the finest gentlemen I have ever known.
Mrs. Nixon joins me today in grieving the death of Norman Chandler. To his wife, Dorothy, and to his two children, we extend our deep condolences. They will take great pride in the life he lived, because he served so many others before himself.
