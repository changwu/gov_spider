    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Talent (R) MO and 6 co-sponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1882, which is intended to ensure fuller analysis of the impacts on small business of proposed rules of certain agencies. However, the Administration has concerns about the bill and will work with the Congress to craft a mutually acceptable bill. The Administration is concerned that:

The bill would deviate from the intent of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA) to increase representation of small business entities in the regulatory process. The bill could provide for representation by large trade associations and individuals unaffiliated with small businesses (for example, attorneys representing a small entity).


No need has been demonstrated to expand the definition of "covered agency".
