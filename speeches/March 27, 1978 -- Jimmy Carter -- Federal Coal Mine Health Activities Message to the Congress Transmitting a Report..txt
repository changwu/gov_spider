    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1975 Annual Report of Health Activities under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.
I recommend that the statutory reporting requirement for this report be changed from once every year to once every three years. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare staff resources and time could be better spent on more research rather than on the preparation of annual reports of largely repetitious material. Basic information in this field has been known for some time, and new findings develop only slowly and infrequently. All of the information contained in this report is available to Congress during annual appropriations and oversight hearings, and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare will inform Congress immediately of any scientific breakthroughs in the field.
