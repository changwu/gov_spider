    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), (the Act), I transmit herewith an exchange of notes extending the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signed at Washington on November 26, 1976, for the period of one year from December 31, 1986, until December 31, 1987.
This Agreement is one of a series negotiated in accordance with the Act. We have not sought to renegotiate the agreement for a number of reasons, and it has been extended for periods of one year to eighteen months since July 1982. The extension of this Agreement will permit U.S. fishermen to continue cooperative fisheries arrangements with Soviet fishermen. Unless the Agreement is extended these operations will cease, causing significant financial hardship to U.S. fishermen.
I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this extension at an early date.
RONALD REAGAN
