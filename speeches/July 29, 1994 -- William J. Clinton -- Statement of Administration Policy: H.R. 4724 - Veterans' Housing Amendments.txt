    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sangmeister (D) IL and six others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4724. The Administration, however, will work with the Senate to offset the direct spending associated with the bill.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4724 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate for this bill is presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates.
