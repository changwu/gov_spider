    PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT.
WASHINGTON, April 4, 1841.
An all-wise Providence having suddenly removed from this life William Henry Harrison, late President of the United States, we have thought it our duty, in the recess of Congress and in the absence of the Vice-President from the seat of Government, to make this afflicting bereavement known to the country by this declaration under our hands.
He died at the President's house, in this city, this 4th day of April, A. D. 1841, at thirty minutes before 1 o'clock in the morning.
The people of the United States, overwhelmed, like ourselves, by an event so unexpected and so melancholy, will derive consolation from knowing that his death was calm and resigned, as his life has been patriotic, useful, and distinguished, and that the last utterance of his lips expressed a fervent desire for the perpetuity of the Constitution and the preservation of its true principles. In death, as in life, the happiness of his country was uppermost in his thoughts.
DANIEL WEBSTER,
Secretary of State .
THOMAS EWING,
Secretary of the Treasury.
JOHN BELL,
Secretary of War
J. J. CRITTENDEN,
Attorney-General
FRANCIS GRANGER,
Postmaster-General.
(The Secretary of the Navy was absent from the city.)
