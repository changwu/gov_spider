    CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott celebrated the first anniversary of the Dobbs Decision with a speech at Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, a new digital ad, and an op-ed in The Des Moines Register.
To note the first anniversary of Dobbs, Tim told the Faith and Freedom audience on Friday: "Thank God Almighty for the Dobbs decision. We are creating a culture of life in America, and that's a really good thing... The radical left has lost so much faith in America. They've lost faith in life itself. But we are here to tell 'em life is good and we are proud to be Americans. We are proud to live in the freest, fairest land on God's green earth."
Writing in The Des Moines Register on Friday, Tim celebrated the Dobbs decision and shared the next steps for the pro-life movement: "I am 100% pro-life. When I am president of the United States, I will sign the most pro-life legislation the House and Senate can put on my desk. We should begin with a 15-week national limit. Poll after poll shows that a clear majority of Americans oppose abortion in the second trimester and agree it should be restricted. Which raises the real question: Why is the radical left OK with aborting babies up until the day they are born? Now that Dobbs has returned the decision back to "We the People," Americans will be able to actively voice their support for life in a way they haven't been able to in more than 50 years."
Additionally, the campaign released a new digital ad, "Gospel Truth," to mark the anniversary. In the ad, Tim slams the Left's radical views on the issue of abortion.
