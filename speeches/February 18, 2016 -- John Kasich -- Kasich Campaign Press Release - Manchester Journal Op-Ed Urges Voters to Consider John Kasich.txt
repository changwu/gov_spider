Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich has demonstrated that he is someone who could unite us.
Throughout this Presidential election cycle, we've all watched candidates on both sides of the aisle air millions worth of negative ads, make hateful statements about large portions of the population, or take political positions that are so far outside the bounds of what is pragmatic and prudent. The presidential debates have become a poor excuse for political discourse. In quite the contrast, Governor Kasich has consistently aired positive ads, stressed his ability to work across the aisle, and preached a hopeful message of lifting up the most vulnerable Americans who have fallen in the shadows.
In New Hampshire, he had Republicans, Independents, and Democrats alike lead him to a second place victory because they recognized this inspirational message. They saw a uniter, someone who has a respect for all individuals, wherever they fall on the political spectrum.

Kasich doesn't pander to the political extremes on the left, or the right. Instead, he is both a pragmatist and an optimist. He seeks out the inherent good in people. As President, John Kasich would be focused on getting things done through working together rather than dividing us through promoting policies that are the furthest to the right or the left. His record speaks to that, both as Governor of a swing state, and as a Republican leader who worked with a Democratic President in the 1990s.
Many Democrats and Independents in Vermont may feel skeptical about asking for a Republican ballot when its time to vote. But when you have the opportunity to vote for someone who cares more about working together and unifying our country than spewing divisive rhetoric, it's well worth it. That's why on Tuesday March 1, I hope you'll join me by voting for Governor John Kasich in the Vermont presidential primary.
