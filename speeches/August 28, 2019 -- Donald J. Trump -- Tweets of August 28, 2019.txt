Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE let's see what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said 'why don't we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it!' The media in our Country is totally out of control!Retweets: 22998Favorites: 98370

Can you believe it? I'm at 94% approval in the Republican Party and have Three Stooges running against me. One is 'Mr. Appalachian Trail' who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons....Retweets: 35Favorites: 150

....Another is a one-time BAD Congressman from Illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide then failed in radio. The third is a man who couldn't stand up straight while receiving an award. I should be able to take them!Retweets: 16299Favorites: 88405

A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them! Been calling me wrong for years along with the few remaining Never Trumpers - All Losers! https://t.co/KlzzMC40VtRetweets: 12697Favorites: 54509

'The infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office' @OANN was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! He is now quitting Twitter after being called a 'bedbug.' Tough guy!Retweets: 14213Favorites: 63874

So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!Retweets: 24313Favorites: 111589

We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads as usual to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready and will do a great job. When they do let them know it and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!Retweets: 13900Favorites: 59167

Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn the leader of Britain's Labour Party to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for & will prove to be 'a great one!' Love U.K.Retweets: 21261Favorites: 92686

Just watched @FoxNews heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor @SandraSmithFox. Terrible considering that Fox couldn't even land a debate the Dems give them NOTHING! @CNN & @MSNBC....Retweets: 14318Favorites: 58227

....are all in for the Open Border Socialists (or beyond). Fox hires 'give Hillary the questions' @donnabrazile Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do Win. Too Bad!....Retweets: 12659Favorites: 53354

....I don't want to Win for myself I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore!Retweets: 26563Favorites: 104467

Our Federal Reserve cannot 'mentally' keep up with the competition - other countries. At the G-7 in France all of the other Leaders were giddy about how low their Interest Costs have gone. Germany is actually 'getting paid' to borrow money - ZERO INTEREST PLUS! No Clue Fed!Retweets: 15222Favorites: 55454

Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!....Retweets: 20064Favorites: 88919

Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly) I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!Retweets: 20220Favorites: 79380

A sad day for the Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I'm glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!Retweets: 34588Favorites: 208920
