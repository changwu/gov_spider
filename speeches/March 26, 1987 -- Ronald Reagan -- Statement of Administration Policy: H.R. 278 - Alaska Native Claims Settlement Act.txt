    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Young (R) Alaska)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 278 because it contains fundamental policy flaws. The bill would expand upon the intended permanent settlement of Alaska Native Claims established in 1971, establish permanent racially-defined special economic and property rights, and could generate substantial litigation.
If H.R. 278 should be enacted in its present form, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he dispprove it.
