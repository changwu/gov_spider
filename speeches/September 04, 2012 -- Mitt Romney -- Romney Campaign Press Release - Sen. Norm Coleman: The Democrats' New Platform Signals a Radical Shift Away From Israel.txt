    Former Senator and National Co-Chairman of the Romney Jewish Coalition Norm Coleman made the following statement today on the Democratic Party removing pro-Israel language from its platform:
"I am alarmed by the changes regarding Israel in the Democratic Party platform.  Anyone familiar with the way in which these documents are drafted understands the care that is taken with every word. By failing to mention Jerusalem as Israel's capital, by no longer insisting that Palestinian refugees be settled inside a future Palestinian state rather than in Israel, and by failing to condemn Hamas—all new positions from four years ago—the Democratic Party is signaling a radical shift in its orientation, away from Israel. Does the document accurately mirror Barack Obama's views? Given that his top aides have said that the platform reflects his policies, and given that his official White House spokesman has also refused to name Jerusalem as Israel's capital, that is now an urgent question to which the American people deserve an immediate and unequivocal response."
