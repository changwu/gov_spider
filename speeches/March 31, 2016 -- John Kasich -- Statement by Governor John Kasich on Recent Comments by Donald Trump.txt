    Today Gov. Kasich issued the following statement in response to recent comments made by Donald Trump:
"The past 24 hours revealed in the clearest way yet that Donald Trump is not prepared to be President. On top of all his previous inflammatory statements, yesterday he proposed punishing women who receive abortions, attacked the Geneva Conventions and said he'd nominate Supreme Court justices based on who will look into Hillary Clinton's email scandal.
Donald Trump is not ready to be Commander in Chief. He talks loosely about the use of nuclear weapons and of dismantling NATO. America is facing major challenges at home and abroad and cannot afford to elect a President who does not respect the seriousness of the office.
Since the beginning of the campaign, I have focused on uniting our country and finding solutions to the threats we are facing. I believe you can be a defender of life while respecting women, you can defend our country without alienating our allies and basic human rights and you win against Hillary Clinton without using outlandish rhetoric. As President, I will approach every day with the seriousness of purpose our country deserves."
