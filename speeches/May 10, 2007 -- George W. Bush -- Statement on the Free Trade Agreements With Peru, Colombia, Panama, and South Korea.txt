    I am pleased that my administration and congressional leaders have concluded a bipartisan agreement that provides a clear path for advancing our proposed free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Expanding opportunities for the sale of American goods and services is crucial to continued growth and job creation here in America. While these agreements will move forward independently, my administration is committed to working with Members of Congress and with the governments of our free trade agreement partners to secure the approval of each agreement. I also look forward to working with the Congress to extend trade promotion authority to negotiate agreements that open markets and generate new economic opportunities.
