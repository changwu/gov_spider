REP. PAUL RYAN: "This election is a choice of two futures: do you want a government-centered society in a government-driven economy and government-rationed healthcare or do you want the American opportunity society with a safety net, a free economy, economic freedom, personal liberty? That's what we want; that's the American idea. We have one more chance, as a people, to get that back and that chance is going to come on November the 6th."
