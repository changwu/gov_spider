    I AM pleased to have received today the final report of the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System. The members of the Commission deserve the appreciation of the country for the care which they have devoted to this report.
One could not ask for a more dedicated Chairman than Senator Roman L. Hruska. His able leadership during the entire life of the Commission is to be commended. Also, the Commission itself is noteworthy, not only because of the superior quality of each of the members but because it includes leading Members of both Houses of Congress, distinguished judges, practitioners, and members of the academic branch of the legal profession.
Certainly, the importance of the Supreme Court, the circuit courts, and the Federal judicial system to our society and to our people cannot be overestimated. We owe these courts the fullest measure of support to assure that they function effectively. In the final analysis, our courts function for the well-being of the citizenry. The effective, efficient operation of the judicial system is essential to safeguard our rights and our liberties.
After extensive study, the Commission has published its thoughtful and imaginative recommendations for change.
I will give the Commission's recommendations serious study, and I know the Congress and the Chief Justice will do the same. These efforts should go hand-in-hand with a thorough review of the basic causes for the ever-increasing number of cases being brought in the Federal courts. We should also strive to fashion ways to reduce the volume of Federal litigation and to expedite the disposition of cases before the courts.
