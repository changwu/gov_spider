    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Musgrave (R) Colorado)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.J.Res. 106. Marriage is the foundation of society and should not be redefined by a few activist judges and local officials. Without a constitutional amendment, judges and local officials could continue to attempt to redefine marriages in their States. Judges could even strike down the Defense of Marriage Act that was passed by an overwhelming bipartisan margin and declare that same-sex marriages recognized in one State must be recognized as marriages everywhere else. The only alternative left for the people's voice to be heard is an amendment to the Constitution - the only law a court cannot overturn. The future of marriage in America should be decided through the democratic constitutional amendment process, which involves both the Congress and the States, rather than by court order. The Administration urges members of the House to promptly pass, and to send to the States for ratification, an amendment to protect marriage.
