    I send greetings to all Americans celebrating Labor Day 2008.
In America, all citizens have an opportunity to forge their own paths forward, and their success is limited only by the size of their dreams. From engineering to health care and from small businesses to education, the American people are the most industrious, enterprising, and productive in the world. These talented and innovative workers provide for their families and play a vital role in building a more prosperous future for our country. By trusting in the ingenuity and creativity of America's risk-takers and dreamers, our country will remain the most vibrant, hopeful, and dynamic around the globe.
Each year on Labor Day, we honor the dedicated men and women of our Nation's workforce. Their determined efforts add to the strength and vitality of our country and build a brighter future for America.
Laura and I send our best wishes.
GEORGE W. BUSH
