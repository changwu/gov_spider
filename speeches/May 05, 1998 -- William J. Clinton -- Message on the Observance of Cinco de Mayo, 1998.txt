    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
On this day in 1862, brave Mexicans stood up against seemingly overwhelming odds to defend their right to self-determination, and they emerged victorious. It is their spirit and their valiant contribution to the cause of freedom that we celebrate today.
This annual commemoration of the Mexican Army's triumph at the Battle of Puebla gives us a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the richness of Mexico's cultural contributions to U.S. society and the long-standing ties of friendship between our two peoples. The reverence for freedom that we share has been the firm foundation of our relationship in the past and will continue to strengthen us as we look forward to the promise of the future.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a memorable celebration.
BILL CLINTON
