    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to the White House on May 20, 2005. Denmark is a close friend and ally of the United States, and Prime Minister Rasmussen is a strong proponent of effective transatlantic cooperation. Under his leadership, Denmark has been a key partner in advancing freedom and democracy around the world. President Bush looks forward to discussing with the Prime Minster how Denmark and the United States can continue to support freedom and democracy, particularly in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Broader Middle East North Africa Initiative, NATO and U.S.-EU issues, as well as the President's current trip to Europe.
