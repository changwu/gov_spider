    Assistant to the President John Brennan called President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen this morning to urge Saleh to sign and implement the Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered agreement so that Yemen is able to move forward immediately with its political transition. Brennan noted that this transfer of power represents the best path forward for Yemen to become a more secure, unified, and prosperous nation and for the Yemeni people to realize their aspirations for peace and political reform. He affirmed the commitment of the United States to stand with the Yemeni government and people as they implement this historic agreement, foster economic development, and combat the security threat from al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula. Brennan also reiterated that all parties must refrain from violence and proceed with the transition in a peaceful and orderly manner.
