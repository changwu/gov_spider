    Today I am sending to the State of California $10 million from the disaster relief fund. These funds will be used by the State and local governments in the flooded areas to remove debris and to take protective measures to ensure the health and safety of their residents.
At this time, I have approved Federal assistance for 34 California counties stricken by the disastrous floods. Our hearts go out to the people who have suffered losses in these disastrous floods. I have asked James L. Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to make certain that all appropriate resources of the Federal Government are applied to assist the State of California in helping their citizens to begin to recover from this disaster. The action I have taken today will be a start for California residents down the difficult road to recovery.
