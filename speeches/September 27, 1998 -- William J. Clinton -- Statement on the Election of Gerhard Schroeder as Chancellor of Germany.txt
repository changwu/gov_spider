    Today the German people have once again exercised their democratic right to determine their national leadership. I extend my sincerest congratulations to Gerhard Schroeder. He and I had good discussions in Berlin this spring and in Washington this summer. I look forward to working closely with him. Germany is one of America's closest allies. As always, our two governments will be fully engaged in a comprehensive policy agenda.
I also want to convey my gratitude and that of all Americans to Helmut Kohl. During his 16-year tenure, he has made historic contributions to the unity of his nation, the strength of our Euro-Atlantic community, and to peace throughout the world.
