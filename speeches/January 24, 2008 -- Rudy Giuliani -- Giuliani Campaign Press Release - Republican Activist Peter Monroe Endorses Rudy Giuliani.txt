    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of Republican activist Peter Monroe of Pinellas County. Monroe will serve as a Co-Chair of the Mayor's Catastrophe Advisory Committee.
"In Florida, we face a broken insurance market," said Monroe. "Rudy Giuliani is the only presidential candidate who understands the need for a national catastrophe insurance fund, not only for Florida, but for many other states that face natural disasters and catastrophic events."
"We welcome Peter to the Mayor's campaign and to the Advisory Committee," said Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, Giuliani's Florida Chairman. "He is a tireless advocate on the issues of a national catastrophe fund, and I know he will be a great asset to our campaign."
