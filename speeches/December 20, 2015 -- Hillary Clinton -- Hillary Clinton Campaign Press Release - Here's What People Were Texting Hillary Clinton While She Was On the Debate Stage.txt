Before the debate started, I sent a text message to Hillary's supporters, asking them to tell us why they're with Hillary.

The responses perfectly sum up what this campaign is about.
Want to text with Hillary? Send IMWITHHER to 47246 and we'll add you to her contacts.
Some texters admire her fight against the gun lobby.

Others know she's the best choice for our economy.

(You can see one of those awesome town hall moments here.)
Lots of support came from people who know she's got the experience to be commander in chief.

Plenty of texters told us that her plan to make college affordable and take on education debt would change their lives.

Tons of people brought up their families.

Many are invested in the fights she's been waging for years.

Some of the texts were super sweet.

But, by far, the most touching responses were the ones about Hillary building a world where our children believe they can do anything.

These replies show exactly what Hillary is fighting for: You! And because she's fighting for you, you've all been fighting for her. This is exactly what Hillary's campaign is about. Now, let's get her to the White House!
