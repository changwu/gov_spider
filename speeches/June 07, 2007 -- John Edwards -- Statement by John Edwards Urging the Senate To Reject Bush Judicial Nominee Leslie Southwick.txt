    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject President Bush's nominee of Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
"President Bush's nominee, Judge Leslie Southwick, has an abysmal record of voting against the interests of workers, consumers and the civil rights of all Americans. We must demand that federal judges have demonstrated their commitment to Americans' full range of constitutional protections. Judge Southwick fails that standard. The stakes are too high for the Senate to wave through yet another hard-right Bush judicial nominee."
