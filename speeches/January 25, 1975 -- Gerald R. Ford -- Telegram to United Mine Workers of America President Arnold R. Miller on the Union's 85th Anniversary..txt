    AS THE United Mine Workers of America marks its eighty-fifth anniversary, your members deserve the congratulations and gratitude of the American people.
Since the founding of your great union before the turn of the century, mine workers have contributed immeasurably to the progress and economic welfare of all Americans. The UMW has fought long and hard to advance the overall status of American miners And in doing so, it has helped to improve the well-being of all American workers.
I welcome this opportunity to assure you that my Administration stands firmly behind your continuing efforts to bring about even greater improvements in the safety and welfare of miners.
As we reinforce our national effort to achieve an independent fuel supply to heat our homes and run our industry, the coal your members mine will be more important than ever.
Your union has my very best wishes on this proud milestone in the annals of American labor history.
GERALD R. FORD
