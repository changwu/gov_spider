    President Bush today accepted with regret the resignation of Frederick D. McClure, 37, who has served as Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs since the beginning of the administration. Fred is resigning to become a director and member of the management committee of First Southwest Co. in Dallas, TX. First Southwest is a diversified investment banking firm. His resignation is effective February 1, 1992.
"Fred McClure has served with dedication and creativity," President Bush said when accepting his resignation. "Fred has directed enormous victories in legislative efforts ranging from the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Clean Air Act, the Persian Gulf resolution, the civil rights bill, extending fast track negotiating authority for the North American free trade agreement, and the recently signed highway legislation. He also has been a crucial member of my team in ensuring that none of my 24 vetoes have been overridden when I have been forced to use this tool to ensure the passage of sound legislation. I am enormously grateful for his advice and support throughout this administration."
