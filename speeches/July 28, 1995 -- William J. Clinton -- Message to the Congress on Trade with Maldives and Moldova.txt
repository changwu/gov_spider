    To the Congress of the United States:
The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program offers duty-free treatment to specified products that are imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. The program is authorized by title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Maldives should be suspended from the GSP program because it is not making sufficient progress in protecting basic labor rights. I also have decided to designate Moldova as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP program because I have determined that Moldova satisfies the statutory criteria.
This notice is submitted in accordance with the requirements of section 502(a)(1) and 502(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974.
