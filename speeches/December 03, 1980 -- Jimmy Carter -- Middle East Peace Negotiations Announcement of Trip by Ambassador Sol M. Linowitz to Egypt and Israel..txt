    The President has asked Ambassador Sol M. Linowitz to travel to both Egypt and Israel to consult with President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin and their colleagues on how to ensure continued momentum and progress in the Middle East peace process.
Throughout his administration, the President has accorded the highest priority to furthering peace efforts in the Middle East and, therefore, to maintaining momentum in the Camp David process.
Both President Carter and President-elect Reagan have pledged themselves to ensure continuity and an effective transition in foreign policy matters.
Upon his return, Ambassador Linowitz will report to the President so that the President can ensure that the President-elect will be fully informed and prepared with respect to the United States effort to attain comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
