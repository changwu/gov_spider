    This year marks the' one hundredth anniversary of Thomas Alva Edison's invention of the incandescent lamp. More than any other invention, the light bulb ushered in the Age of Electricity. When Edison had perfected it, he knew he was ready to bring electric lighting into the streets, homes, factories and offices of America. And he did.
In recognition of this historic feat, a series of events throughout 1979 will be held across the country to honor Edison's inventive genius. These events will offer our people many chances to review and reflect on the numerous important inventions that came from the mind and hands of this unique American.
But Thomas Edison was more than an inventor. He was a true innovator. He pioneered the first industrial research laboratory. He created the industries and institutions to bring his inventions to the people. He brought about change, opportunity and progress for all mankind.
As we commemorate the invention of the incandescent lamp and celebrate the accomplishments of this remarkable man, we should all draw new inspiration from him. I hope that the memory of Thomas Alva Edison will help us all to realize, as he did, that with perseverance, hard work, knowledge and imagination we can overcome adversity and achieve new advances from which all can benefit.
