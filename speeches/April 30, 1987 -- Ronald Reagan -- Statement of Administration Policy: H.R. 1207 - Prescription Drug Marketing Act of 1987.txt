    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Dingell (D) (Michigan) and 40 others)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 1207, because (1) insufficient evidence exists to indicate that significant health problems have occurred, (2) there are laws and programs already in place and working to remedy problems of drug counterfeiting and diversion, (3) certain types of legitimate and beneficial drug distribution would be unnecessarily curtailed, and (4) the provisions of the bill could not be cost effectively implemented by either FDA or its counterpart State and local agencies, and would be costly for the majority of the industry that are not involved in the illegal activities that H.R. 1207 intends to address.
