    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of Rosh Hashanah:
"Shanah Tovah. Happy new year to our Jewish brothers and sisters observing Rosh Hashanah. I wish you a time of meaningful prayer, reflection, and celebration.
"The Talmud cites two reasons to sound the Shofar (ram's horn) on Rosh Hashanah. One is to accept God's dominion as King. The other is to recall the weeping of Sisera's mother, who wept for her son who went missing in battle. It is these two qualities of the Jewish people — religious faith and generous humanity — which have made such a tremendous impact on our civilization.
"I pray that the coming year — 5776 — will be one of peace, prosperity and abundant blessing for the Jewish people and for the nation of Israel. Now more than ever we must further strengthen our unshakable bond to confront the many challenges that threaten our future and our survival."
