    Frank Fitzsimmons was an important and powerful voice in the American labor movement. His death is a sad moment not only for the millions of Teamster union members he so diligently represented but for our nation as well.
Affable and humorous, Frank Fitzsimmons was also—from his earliest days as a labor organizer in the 1930's—a hard bargainer who won the respect of both business and political leaders throughout the Nation.
Frank was here at the White House recently. I expressed gratitude then for his kind words of support. All of us were deeply impressed with the courage and dignity with which he bore his illness.
I was personally very fond of Frank and will miss him. Nancy and I convey our deepest sympathy to his family and to the members of the Teamsters union.
