    Members of the Congress, the designated members of the Commission, and guests:
It is a great privilege for me to participate in the actual swearing in of these six very distinguished individuals who will be undertaking a very serious responsibility.
The campaign reform legislation, which was enacted by the Congress in 1974, which I had the privilege of signing, is landmark legislation, and the responsibilities that these five men and this one most attractive lady have is a responsibility that I know they will take seriously.
It is a combination of individuals selected--two by myself and four by the Congress--who can really, in the months and years ahead, set a path for the kind of elections that we want.
We want clean elections. We want fair elections. We want the best people campaigning and the best results as the American people decide.
I have great faith in all of them. I know some better than others, but as I have looked over their records, I think the House and the Senate and the White House have selected fine people for a great, great responsibility.
So, with the best of good wishes for them to carry out this mission, I now ask Mr. Ratchford to perform the service of swearing them in.
