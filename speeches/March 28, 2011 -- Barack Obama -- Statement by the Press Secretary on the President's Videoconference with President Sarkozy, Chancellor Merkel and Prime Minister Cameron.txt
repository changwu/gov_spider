    President Obama spoke by videoconference this afternoon with President Sarkozy, Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Cameron as part of his regular consultations with European allies. They had a broad strategic discussion of recent events in the Middle East and focused particular attention on Libya and Egypt. On Libya, they welcomed the international conference that will be held tomorrow in London. They reviewed the significant progress achieved by coalition forces during the first phase of operations to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973, protect civilians in Libya, and prevent a humanitarian crisis. They agreed that Qadhafi had lost any legitimacy to rule and should leave power, and that the Libyan people should have the political space to determine their own future. They also discussed the transition to NATO command and control to enforce UNSCR 1973. President Obama reiterated that the United States will provide supporting capabilities to the Coalition effort. On Egypt, the leaders discussed the latest political developments following the March 19 constitutional referendum and additional ways the international community could help support the democratic transition there.
