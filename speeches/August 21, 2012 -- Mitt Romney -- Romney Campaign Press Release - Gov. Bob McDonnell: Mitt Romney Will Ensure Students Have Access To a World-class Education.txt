    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for education reform:
"Mitt Romney's education reform plan—developed by a leader with a record of innovation during his term as governor of Massachusetts—will ensure that every American student has access to a world-class education. Unlike President Obama, Mitt Romney will provide the choices students need to enroll in good schools, the information parents need to hold districts accountable, and the jobs graduates need to be successful in the global economy."
