    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jeffords (R) VT and Pell (D) HI)
The Administration has no objection to enactment of S. 1999 as reported by the House Education and Labor Committee. The bill would clarify certain administrative arrangements for the National Commission on Responsibilities for Financing Postsecondary Education.
The House Education and labor Committee deleted provisions of the Senate-passed bill that the Administration strongly opposed. Those provisions would have restored the eligibility of the freely associated States (FAS) for certain Federal education programs.
