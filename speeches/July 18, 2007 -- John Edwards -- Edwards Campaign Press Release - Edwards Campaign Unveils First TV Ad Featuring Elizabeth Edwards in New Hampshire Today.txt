"We are proud to unveil the campaign's first ad featuring Elizabeth Edwards in New Hampshire this week," said Deputy Campaign Manager Jonathan Prince. "This ad is a continuation of the discussion that Senator and Mrs. Edwards have begun with New Hampshire families as they have traveled across the Granite State listening to voters' concerns and talking about John Edwards' bold plans to build one America that works for everyone."
"30 Years" will run on broadcast state-wide and is the next piece of the Edwards campaign's continued efforts to expand its New Hampshire operation. This ad follows "Strength of America," a 30 second spot that began airing in New Hampshire on June 26th and highlighted John Edwards' belief that we all share the responsibility to build a better America. "30 Years" also debuts on the heels of the campaign opening eight new field offices across New Hampshire and hiring an additional 11 field staffers, bringing its New Hampshire payroll total to 40 employees.
John and Elizabeth Edwards are currently traveling to eight states across the country to help shine a light on the crisis of poverty in this country.
Full Script of "30 Years"
I have been blessed for the last 30 years
To be married to the most optimistic person that I have ever met
But at the same time he has an unbelievable toughness
Particularly about other people and that is his ability to fight for them
You're not going to out smart him
He works harder than any human being that I know, always has
It's unbelievably important that in our president we have someone
Who can stare the worst in the face
And not blink
"I'm John Edwards and I approve this message"
