    North Carolinians can send questions to Hillary at www.NCAskMe.com
The Clinton campaign today unveiled its first TV ad in the Tar Heel State. In the 60-second spot, titled "NC Ask Me", Hillary tells North Carolina voters "this election isn't about me, it's about you." Clinton invites North Carolinians to log on to the campaign's new website, www.NCAskMe.com to ask her "anything and everything."
Clinton will answer questions from North Carolina voters in follow-up ads in the coming weeks. The spot will begin running across the state tomorrow.

"NC Ask Me"
TV :60
Hillary Clinton:
"Hi, if you are looking for a typical political commercial, switch the channel.
This isn't a typical election, and these are not typical times.
The economy is reeling and as I talk with people across North Carolina,
I hear about the crushing cost of healthcare from Winston-Salem to Fayetteville.
I hear stories about families going into debt to send their children to college.
Military families from Fort Bragg tell me their deep concerns about how we're treating our veterans.
Teachers and parents tell me that No Child Left Behind just isn't working.
And everywhere, North Carolinians tell me the middle class is just getting slammed.
I want to hear from you.
Because this election isn't about me, it is about you.
So let's have a conversation.
Just go to NCAskMe.com, and then I'll be getting back to you here on TV to answer your questions and offer some solutions.
Thanks.
It's nice talking with you.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message."
