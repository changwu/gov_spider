Good morning from a drizzly South Lawn. Pool is rolling in the motorcade at 7:55 a.m.

Also flagging the POTUS statement that just hit your inboxes and a coming update to the daily guidance with remarks on a counterterrorism operation in Syria being added to the schedule.

Uneventful trip down Independence Avenue, arriving at the Capitol Visitors Center at 8:01 a.m.

POTUS and VPOTUS took the stage at 8:21 to applause and took seats in the front row.
Sen. Mike Rounds is first to speak, taking the lectern on a dais below the stage and discussing the non-partisan history of the event. Row of flags behind him, prompters set up for the president.
Watch here: whitehouse.gov/live
Auditorium, a much smaller venue for this event than in years past, is about 2/3 full. Lots of senators milling around and in seats, including Sens. McConnell, Portman, Klobuchar, Capito, Lankford, Coons (and others taking part in the event are listed below).
Backing up —
Pool held just inside the entryway to the Capitol (on the House side) and waited for stills to get a quick shot of POTUS walking through a hallway at 8:09. Then proceeded down the stairs to the Visitor’s Center auditorium.

POTUS took the stage at 9:05 a.m. following an introduction from Senator Gillibrand (and a rousing keynote by Bryan Stevenson). The room stood and applauded as he stepped up to the dais.
He is speaking now. VP Harris scheduled to follow.
One other addition to the list of spotted senators in the room from the last note: Sen. Joe Manchin, sitting alone on the far right side of the room (h/t Bloomberg’s Nancy Cook).



February 3, 202209:28

In town pool report #5 — POTUS wraps, pool moving out
POTUS wrapped at 9:25 to applause. He shook a few hands and left the auditorium through a door above the stage.
Pool is heading out behind POTUS and returning to the White House, so we will miss the VP Harris remarks.
On the remarks —
He seemed moved by Gillibrand's introduction about his overcoming immense loss, speaking off the cuff at the top about today being his son Beau's birthday and recalled their last conversation in the hospital. He said he didn't deserve so much praise for overcoming personal loss because he had so much family help.
"Everybody has got horrible things that happen to them," he said. "I had a lot of help."
Lots of personal asides to attending senators.
To McConnell: "I don't want to hurt your reputation, but we really are friends."
He asked for prayers for Senator Lujan, who he said he thinks is "going to be okay."
POTUS's prepared remarks lamented how senators no longer spend as much time getting to know one another. Said he prays that "we get back to the place…that we really get to know each other. It's hard to really dislike someone when you know what they're going through."
He noted the country is "at a moment of deep division," urged people to follow Jesus's instruction to "serve rather than be served," adding "I don't always do it."
"I pray to keep the faith in the very promise of America," he said, urging people to look beyond their differences and see the good in one another.
He closed with his favorite Seamus Heaney poem.

In town pool report #11
POTUS wrapped his remarks at 10:26. He did not respond to shouted questions about the number of troops involved and civilian casualties, turning back and exiting the room. He noted he's heading to New York now: "I'm late."
Pool scrambling now to load back into vans, as bad weather means we're motorcading to JBA.
A couple POTUS quotes—
"Knowing that this terrorist had chosen to surround himself with families, including children, we made a choice to pursue a Special Forces raid at a much greater risk than our to our own people rather than targeting him with an airstrike. We made this choice to minimize civilian casualties."
But, he continued, the target opted to detonate a bomb killing not just himself but his family.
Wrapping up: "I'm determined to protect Americans from terrorist threats. And I'll take decisive action to protect this country."

February 3, 202216:42

Travel Pool Report #21 — Quotes 
POTUS largely listened as several attendees talked about the role of community liaisons and ambassadors.
At one point POTUS asked one of the ambassadors if he liked being an ambassador.
POTUS talked about the value of having the parents participating in the lives of the school children. He emphasized the need for parents to be involved in their lives.
Some of his comments were inaudible. As always please check against the transcript.
A shout out to Laura Barrón-López of POLITICO for helping me grab some of POTUS qoutes
The one thing I observed over the years the more you have the parents involved.
"It is difficult for a child no matter what circumstance they are in….if they go back to a totally dysfunctional system in the home."
"I know a lot about schools and one of the most difficult things in schools....is a lack of participation of the parents"
"I don't know of a school that in fact is doing well that does not have more parent participation. That's why I asked the question. I'm not trying to be critical. I'm just trying to understand."
"So education, when done wrong is violence when health needs are not met in a community that's a form of violence.... that's why it's important in a holistic approach that we call healing justice, human justice work. We consider food apartheid, what food the people have access to"

February 3, 202217:15

Travel Pool Report #24 — Quote fix 
Just cleaning up a quote from previous pool report. Fix is in bold.
Cleaned up Biden quote responding to Bain, from last report...
Biden: "Yes and no. This is even more basic than that. What I'm trying to get at is that it is difficult to, for a child no matter what circumstance you're in for 10 hours a day when they leave home to go to school, go back, if they go back to a totally dysfunctional system. And so that's why I'm asking. You haven't talked at all about the home and what impact that has on what you're doing."
