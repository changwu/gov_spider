    DES MOINES, Iowa â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke out Sunday during a round table discussion with family caregivers in favor of paid family leave for new parents.
Sanders called for three months of paid leave if an employee has a child. Sanders is one of 19 Senate cosponsors of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Rep. Rosa DeLauro is the chief sponsor of a companion bill supported by 101 other members of the House of Representatives. The measures also would provide paid leave for workers diagnosed with a serious medical condition.
"When parents have a baby they should not be forcibly separated from that baby because they cannot afford to stay at home with their child," Sanders said during the discussion at the Central Presbyterian Church.
"The United States remains one of the only major countries in the world that does not guarantee paid family and medical leave to its people," he added. "It is unconscionable that millions of new parents in this country are forced back to work because they don't have the income to stay home with their newborn babies."
The family leave legislation would be paid for by adding about $1.38 a week to payroll taxes for the average worker. "I think that's a pretty good investment and I would hope every candidate running for president of the United States would be a strong advocate of this legislation," Sanders said.
