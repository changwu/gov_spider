    Florida Senator Marco Rubio today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"Americans need to ask themselves: what does it say about President Obama's weakness on foreign policy matters that our allies like Israel openly express frustration with him, while our enemies like Hugo Chavez openly endorse his reelection? The truth is that in every corner of the world, President Obama's foreign policy has been a failure. He failed to improve America's standing in the world, because he doesn't understand America's exceptional role in the world. Mitt Romney understands that the world is safer when America is stronger, and he'll pursue a clear and unequivocal foreign policy based on peace through strength."
