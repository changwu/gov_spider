    CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT TO DEAN ACHESON
DEAN ACHESON, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States from 1940 to December 31, 1946. Mr. Acheson, as a private citizen in 1940, was among those who first saw clearly the Fascist threat to our national existence. He exerted his distinguished advocacy to rally his fellow citizens in favor of the delivery of American destroyers to beleaguered Britain. As Assistant Secretary of State from February 1, 1941 to August 16, 1945, and as Under Secretary of State until today, he has been one of the architects of victory and of the struggle for peace. In his relations with the Congress, Mr. Acheson fostered a responsive relationship between the Executive and Legislative Branches of the Government in the field of foreign affairs; and he brought to the councils of government a long view and a genius for bold design typified by the Acheson-Lilienthal plan for international control of atomic energy.
