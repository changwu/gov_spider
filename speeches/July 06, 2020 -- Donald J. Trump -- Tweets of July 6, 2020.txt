They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct. Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!Retweets: 37598Favorites: 170318

Deaths from the China Virus are down 39%, while our great testing program continues to lead the World, by FAR! Why isn't the Fake News reporting that Deaths are way down? It is only because they are, indeed, FAKE NEWS!Retweets: 33722Favorites: 145335

The Democrats would not have BANNED travel from heavily infected China, especially so early, therefore, far more people would have died. Corrupt Joe Biden now admits this!!!Retweets: 24004Favorites: 104277

Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don't want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons, not for health reasons! They think it will help them in November. Wrong, the people get it!Retweets: 44011Favorites: 187858
