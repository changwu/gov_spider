    The President welcomes today's congressional action to finalize an assistance package for Ukraine. This legislation will allow us to provide crucial support to Ukraine through loan guarantees that will facilitate access to needed financing to Ukraine as it takes essential steps to restore economic stability and return to growth and prosperity. The Administration supports the targeted sanctions authority provided in the bill to impose costs on individuals and entities who are responsible for acts of violence against the Ukrainian people or are undermining Ukraine's peace, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity. Together with our international partners, the President will continue to build support for the Ukrainian people at this critical time. We also continue to urge Republicans in Congress to stop blocking important IMF reforms to ensure the IMF has the resources it needs to fulfill its mission and expand the tools available for Ukraine and other countries.
