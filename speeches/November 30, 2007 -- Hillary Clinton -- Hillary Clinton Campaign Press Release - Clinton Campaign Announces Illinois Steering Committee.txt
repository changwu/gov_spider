    The Clinton campaign today announced its Illinois Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Illinois' February 5th primary.
"Hillary is ready to lead on her first day in the White House and immediately begin delivering the change this country needs," said Jacqueline Jackson, Illinois philanthropist, business leader, and community activist.
"Hillary remains Illinois' favorite daughter, so it's no surprise that she's generated enthusiasm across the state," said Betsy Ebeling, who grew up with Hillary in Park Ridge.
"Her 35-year record fighting in the trenches for change makes Hillary the right choice for Illinois and America," said Tim Wright, former Director of Domestic Policy for Bill Clinton's '92 Campaign for President, former Chairman of the Export /Import Bank of the United States' Advisory Committee on Sub Saharan Africa and Chicago attorney.
"Americans are looking for a leader who can rebuild our standing in the world and tackle the great challenges we face at home," said Daniel Solis, Chicago City Alderman. "There's no question that Hillary Clinton is that leader."
"I have seen Hillary's intellect and ability up close, and she has what it takes to be an outstanding President," said Kevin O'Keefe, former Clinton White House official and Chicago attorney.
"I am honored to have such strong support from my home state," Clinton said. "Together we'll take our message of change across Illinois and this nation."
