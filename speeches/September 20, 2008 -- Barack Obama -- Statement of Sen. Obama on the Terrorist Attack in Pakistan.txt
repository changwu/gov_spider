    Chicago, IL - Below is a Statement from Senator Barack Obama on the Terrorist Attack in Pakistan:
"I strongly condemn the tragic terrorist attack in Pakistan, and my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.
"Today's attack demonstrates the grave and urgent threat that al Qaeda and its affiliates pose to the United States, to Pakistan, and to the security of all nations. As the attack earlier this week on our embassy in Yemen shows, over seven years after 9/11, the terrorist threat knows no borders, and the terrorists threaten innocent civilians of all religions and regions. Now is the time to refocus our efforts on defeating al Qaeda and securing the American people.
"Today's attack also reminds us once again that the Pakistani people have suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists, and are endangered by the violent extremists operating within their borders. We must forge a deep and lasting partnership with Pakistan, and with nations around the world, to root out and destroy al Qaeda and its affiliates. The United States must lead a truly global effort to prevail against al Qaeda and their hate-filled ideology," said Senator Barack Obama.
