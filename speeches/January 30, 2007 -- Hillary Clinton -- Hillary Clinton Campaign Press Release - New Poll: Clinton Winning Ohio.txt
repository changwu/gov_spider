    Ohio pollster: "Those who say Hillary can't win the White House because she can't win a key swing state like Ohio might rethink their assumption"
And on eve of first visit to NH, additional poll has Hillary winning NH Dem primary by 15
According to new public polls today, Hillary Clinton is opening up a significant lead over both Democrats and Republicans in the key battleground state of Ohio, and has a substantial lead over her primary opposition in New Hampshire. The polls in these individual states echo the trend of recent national polls showing Clinton leading in the race for President.
According to the new Quinnipiac poll of Ohio voters, Clinton leads every Republican in a general election matchup, and every Democrat in a primary matchup by a 3 to 1 margin.
"Those who say Sen. Hillary Clinton can't win the White House because she can't win a key swing state like Ohio might rethink their assumption," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "While it's a long way -- 21 months -- to Election Day, these numbers indicate that at this point she is very competitive in Ohio."
In addition, another key new poll shows Hillary opening a substantial lead in New Hampshire. According to the SurveyUSA poll conducted for WBZ-TV Boston, Hillary leads her nearest rival by 15 points in the primary.
These polls come on the heels of a recent Newsweek poll showing Hillary leading every Democratic and Republican contender she was matched up against, and a Time poll showing her leading the Democratic field and tying John McCain in a general election matchup.
"If Hillary leads in Ohio at this point in the race -- the key state that gave the last election to the Republicans -- then this confirms that Hillary can win and is today winning. She is the strongest Democrat in what was the most difficult state," said Clinton chief strategist and pollster Mark Penn.
