  By Dan Tuohy

New Hampshire Union Leader: Talking about "ground game" ahead of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Presidential Primary, it seemed appropriate to hear Tom Rath refer to "Sabermetrics," the statistical study of baseball to identify player performance.
"It's become more like the analytics approach to baseball," he said. "Analytics really drives a lot of the tactical decisions."
His player is John Kasich, the Ohio governor. Rath, a state co-chairman, shared some insight into the Republican presidential hopeful's organization and the use of data-mining technology to target likely voters.
A campaign needs to be precise, focused and patient because, he said, "New Hampshire voters will decide when they're ready to decide."
John Weaver, chief strategist for Kasich, said the data-mining technology complements traditional campaign operations. The idea is to reach out to potential supporters, leverage their connections and build relationships, he said.
The technology indicates where a campaign is strongest and drills down to the demographics, said John E. Sununu, a former U.S. senator who is Kasich's state chairman. He said the data provides a more objective layer, but experience and expertise remain key to the roadmap.
