    Today, Republican members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives wrote the following letter in support of Mitt Romney:
Massachusetts Republican Representatives Stand with Mitt
Over the course of this election season, we members of the Massachusetts Republican Legislative Caucus, have watched and listened as our former Governor's record has been scrutinized by his rivals and by the national media.  Now it is our turn to speak.
Republicans in Massachusetts never had a stronger leader, a greater defender, or a better friend in the State House than Mitt Romney.
Let's start with the economy.  When Mitt was elected Governor, Massachusetts was on the verge of financial disaster.  Workers across the state were being laid off at the rate of thousands a month.
Our state budget was bleeding red ink, and Democratic politicians were proclaiming that only tax increases could fill the gap. Raising taxes, of course, was not Governor Romney's way.  Quite the opposite. With the same energy and intelligence he brings to every challenge he faces, he brought efficiency to our state government.  He streamlined our budget and cut unneeded programs
Without raising taxes—indeed, he cut taxes nineteen times—he balanced the budget every year of his term. By the end of four years, he had turned a $3 billion deficit into a $2 billion rainy-day fund.  With the state government's finances in order, the economy picked up steam. Unemployment at the end of Mitt's term was 4.7 percent, a rate the state envies now.
But the economy was not the only realm where Mitt was a leader. He cracked down on illegal immigration by vetoing an in-state tuition bill and by authorizing state troopers to detain people who had entered the country illegally. When Democrats caved to the teachers unions and sought to impose a one-year moratorium on publicly-funded charter schools, Mitt successfully turned back their efforts.
Every one of these steps required leadership and courage. Massachusetts is the cradle of liberalism and Mitt was willing to say "No" to the liberal agenda. When conservatives in Massachusetts needed someone to fight for them, Mitt stood up and did the fighting. He didn't shrink from unpopular positions that drew heat in the liberal media. He didn't shrink from using his veto power to block Democratic initiatives. Indeed, he exercised his veto power more than 800 times.
Washington D.C. could sorely use a leader of Mitt's uncommon fortitude.  So could the Republican Party. Mitt governed as a conservative in a heavily Democratic Massachusetts. And let's not forget that he garnered enough independent votes to be elected in the first place. He's got a track record that shows he can defeat Barack Obama. 
If Mitt gets to the White House and has a chance to do for the country what he did for Massachusetts, we will see a turnaround in this country unlike any we have seen before. America can get back on the path to strong economic growth and full employment. We know Mitt's extraordinary abilities firsthand. It's time our great country had a great president once again. We feel fortunate that our former Governor is in the race.
Sincerely,
