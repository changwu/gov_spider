    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Hayworth (R) AZ)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3547, but will work in the Senate to make technical amendments and to require payment of fair market value for conveyance of the land to the Alpine Elementary School District in Arizona. The failure to require fair market compensation or a land exchange of equivalent value is contrary to Administration policy and would set an undesirable precedent for such land conveyances.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3547 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that H.R. 3547 would reduce offsetting receipts by $250,000 in fiscal year 1997. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
