    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Young (R) Alaska and two others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 4883 because it would provide excessive and unjustified compensation to the Shee Atika, Kootznoowoo, and Sealaska native corporations for their conveyance to the United States lands and interests therein on Admiralty Island, Alaska.
H.R. 4883 appropriately compensates Shee Atika for its Admiralty Island interests by conveying surface and/or subsurface interests on Baranof Island, Greens Creek, and Bay of Pillars.
However, there is no justification for the bill's required additional compensation to Shee Atika of:
— a $25 million cash payment;
— Forest Service construction of a 20 mile ($6-7 million) road on Baranof Island; and
— forgiveness of an $11 million loan from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Regarding Sealaska, H.R. 4883 would create administrative problems by mixing surface and subsurface interests between private owners and the Government. Finally, H.R. 4883 would also require the Government to give up high priority public use land throughout southeast Alaska in exchange for low priority public use lands held on Admiralty Island by the Kootznoowoo native corporation.
