    THE SHOCKING TRAGEDY of yesterday's event in Austin is heightened because it was so senseless. While senseless, however, what happened is not without a lesson: that we must press urgently for the legislation now pending in Congress to help prevent the wrong persons from obtaining firearms.
The bill would not prevent all such tragedies. But it would help reduce the unrestricted sale of firearms to those who cannot be trusted in their use of possession. How many lives might be saved as a consequence!
The gun control bill has been under consideration in Congress for many months. The time has come for action before further loss of life that might be prevented by its passage.
I know there are many in Congress who share this view. In sorrow and hope, I urge them to join in passing this legislation.
