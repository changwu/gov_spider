    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on the resignation of Admiral William J. Fallon, head of U.S. Central Command:
"Admiral Fallon served our country with honor for over four decades. As a fellow Naval aviator, I know the sacrifices he made during his long and distinguished career. Under Admiral Fallon's leadership at Central Command, the situation in Iraq has improved dramatically. All Americans should be grateful for Admiral Fallon's service, and respect his decision to retire. I am confident President Bush will act promptly to select the right person to lead Central Command at this critical juncture."
