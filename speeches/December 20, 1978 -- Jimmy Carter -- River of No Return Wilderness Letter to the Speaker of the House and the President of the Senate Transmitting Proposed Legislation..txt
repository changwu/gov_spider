    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Wilderness Act of 1964, I am pleased to transmit a proposal to designate a 1.9 million acre River of No Return Wilderness on portions of the Bitterroot, Boise, Challis, Nezperce, Payette and Salmon National Forests in Idaho.
This proposal fulfills a pledge made in my Environmental Message of May 1977 to review and expand the wilderness recommendation for this area submitted to the Congress by the prior Administration. The additional acreage included in my proposal reflects substantial involvement by concerned government and private organizations and groups at the national, state and local levels.
I strongly urge the Congress to favorably consider this proposal to preserve the outstanding natural qualities of this large undeveloped area for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
