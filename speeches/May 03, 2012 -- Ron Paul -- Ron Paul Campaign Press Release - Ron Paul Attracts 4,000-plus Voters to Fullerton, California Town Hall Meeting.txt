LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul continued his pattern of attracting thousands of attendees to his town hall meetings, this time drawing 4,000-plus voters to his California State University at Fullerton campus event.
Tonight's CSUF town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. PST at the school's Titan Stadium, located on W. Campus Drive, Fullerton, CA 92831. Dr. Paul spoke to the CSUF and general community about the need for constitutionally-limited government, the bonds that tie economic and civil liberties, and elements of his 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint that cuts Washington spending, reduces the national debt, and curtails the rapid growth of the federal government.
The Fullerton event was the first in a days-long series of campaign events to be held in California. Ron Paul will hold another large on-campus town hall meeting tomorrow at the University of California at Davis and on Friday, he will hold another at the University of California at San Diego. Details of Dr. Paul's ongoing campaign swing in the Golden State, including information on how to RSVP, can be found here.
