    SAN ANTONIO, TX (September 26, 2019) – On Thursday, September 26, presidential candidate and former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro, issued the following statement on the whistleblower complaint. Following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, Secretary Castro was the first 2020 candidate to call for Donald Trump's and Attorney General William Barr's impeachment. Secretary Castro repeatedly called on House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry after the whistleblower reported details of Donald Trump's calls with Ukrainian officials.
"The whistleblower report has exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House. It's increasingly clear that Donald Trump is not only unfit for office—he's an active national security threat. Donald Trump has abused his office to benefit himself."
"Congress must immediately cancel it's recess and begin impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable. The future of our democracy depends on it."
