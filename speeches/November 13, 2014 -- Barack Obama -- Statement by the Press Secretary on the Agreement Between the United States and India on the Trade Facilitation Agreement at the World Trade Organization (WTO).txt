    The important breakthrough reached today between the United States and India will unlock progress toward the full and immediate implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, which will lower the costs of trade for developed and developing countries alike.
The President had extensive discussions with Prime Minister Modi on this issue and appreciates his personal leadership in finding a path forward.
This breakthrough will also strengthen the multilateral trading system and give a boost to its ongoing work, including in the area of food security. Combined with the recent announcement of a breakthrough on the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the agreement among Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Leaders that the end of those landmark negotiations is coming into focus, this has been a good week for expanding opportunities for American businesses and workers and for promoting growth around the globe.
