    Ed Siskel's many years of experience in public service and a career defending the rule of law make him the perfect choice to serve as my next White House Counsel. For nearly 4 years in the White House when I was Vice President, he helped the Counsel's Office navigate complex challenges and advance the President's agenda on behalf of the American people, and first as a Federal prosecutor and then as the top counsel for one of America's biggest and most vibrant cities, his hometown of Chicago, Ed has shown a deep commitment to public service and respect for the law. His experience will let him hit the ground running as a key leader on my team as we continue making progress for the American people every day.
