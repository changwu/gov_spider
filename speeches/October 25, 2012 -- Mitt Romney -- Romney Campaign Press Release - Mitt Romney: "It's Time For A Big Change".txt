    "The President's campaign is slipping because he can't find an agenda. He's been looking for it. There are only 12 days left. He hasn't had a chance to defend or to describe it to the American people in our debates. And so the American people now have to recognize that given the big challenges we have and the big election we have, it's time for a big change. And Paul Ryan and I represent a big change for America." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "The President's campaign is slipping because he can't find an agenda. He's been looking for it. There are only 12 days left. He hasn't had a chance to defend or to describe it to the American people in our debates. And so the American people now have to recognize that given the big challenges we have and the big election we have, it's time for a big change. And Paul Ryan and I represent a big change for America. We're going to finally tackle the problems politicians have spoken about for years but haven't been willing to deal with. We're going to finally get America strong again with an economy to compete with anyone in the world. We're going to help America get good jobs and rising take-home pay."
