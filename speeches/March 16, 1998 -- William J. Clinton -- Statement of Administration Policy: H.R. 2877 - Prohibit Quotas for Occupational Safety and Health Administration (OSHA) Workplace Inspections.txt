    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Ballenger (R) NC and 22 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2877, which would reaffirm OSHA's current policy of not using citation and penalty quotas to assess employee performance.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2877 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
