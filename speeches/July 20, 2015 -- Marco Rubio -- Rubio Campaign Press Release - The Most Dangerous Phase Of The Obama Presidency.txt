    
July 20, 2015 will be remembered as the day when two sworn enemies of the United States outmaneuvered President Obama to secure historic concessions.
Monday's events at the U.N., Washington and Havana leave no doubt that we have entered the most dangerous phase of the Obama presidency in which the president is flat-out abandoning America's vital national security interests to cozy up to the world's most reprehensible regimes.
This is a symbolic day for the Obama-Clinton foreign policy legacy where the mullahs in Iran and thugs in Cuba celebrated at America's expense.
