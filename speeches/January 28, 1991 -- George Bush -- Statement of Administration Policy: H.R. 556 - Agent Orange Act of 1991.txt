    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Montgomery (D) MS and 43 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 556.
H.R. 556 would require that the Veterans Administration (VA) treat Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, or chloracne (within one year of leaving Vietnam) as if these diseases were contracted as a result of Vietnam service. The VA acting pursuant to its regulatory authority, permits approval of such claims. This bill codifies this authority. Because of the prior VA action the costs associated with these claims are included in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) budget baseline. Since the pay-as-you-go requirements are measured against the baseline, enactment of H.R. 556 will not require offsets in order to avoid a sequester.
