    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kerry (D) Massachusetts)
The Administration has no objection to enactment of the United States Information Agency related provisions of S. 2365.
In addition, the Administration does not object to House passage of the Antiterrorism and Arms Export Amendments Act provisions in S. 2365 but will work with the Senate to improve them. The Administration notes that, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs report on H.R. 3651 (the freestanding, House-passed version of these provisions) makes clear, these provisions are not intended to impair the constitutional authority of the President to conduct foreign relations.
