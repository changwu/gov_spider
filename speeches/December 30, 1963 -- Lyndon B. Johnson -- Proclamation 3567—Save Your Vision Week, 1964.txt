Whereas visual disorders and defects in our younger population interfere with their proper intellectual, social, and emotional development; and
Whereas it is essential to the health of our Nation that our citizens be aware of what is being done and what can be done to control the causes of blindness and visual impairments, and that they avail themselves of opportunities for, conserving vision; and

I also request the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all interested persons and groups to unite during the designated week in public affirmation of our Nation's effort to conserve the God-given and irreplaceable gift of vision.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America, to be affixed.
