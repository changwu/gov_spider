    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 327, the "Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002." This legislation will help achieve an important objective of my Administration to reduce the cost and burden on small businesses of government paperwork and increase the resources available to small businesses to create jobs and economic growth.
Section 3 of the bill creates a new section 3520 in title 44 of the United States Code to create an interagency task force on information collection and dissemination to help the heads of departments and agencies reduce the government burden on small businesses. Section 3520 purports to require task force publication of differences in views among executive officers and transmittal of recommendations to congressional committees. The executive branch shall construe section 3520 in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch, to protect the confidentiality of executive deliberations, and to recommend to the consideration of the Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
GEORGE W. BUSH
