    President Donald J. Trump spoke today with President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to discuss the alliance's response to North Korea's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Both leaders underscored the grave threat that North Korea's latest provocation poses not only to the United States and the Republic of Korea, but to the entire world.  President Trump and President Moon reaffirmed their strong condemnation of North Korea's reckless campaign to advance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, noting that these weapons only serve to undermine North Korea's security and deepen its diplomatic and economic isolation.
