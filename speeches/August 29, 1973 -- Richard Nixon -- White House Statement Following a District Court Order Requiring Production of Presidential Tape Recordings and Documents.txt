    AS MR. WRIGHT pointed out in his oral argument before the court, in camera inspection of these tapes is inconsistent with the President's position relating to the question of separation of powers as provided by the Constitution and the necessity of maintaining the precedent of confidentiality of private Presidential conversations for this President and for Presidents in the future. The President consequently will not comply with this order.
White House Counsel are now considering the possibility of obtaining appellate review, or how otherwise to sustain the President's position.
