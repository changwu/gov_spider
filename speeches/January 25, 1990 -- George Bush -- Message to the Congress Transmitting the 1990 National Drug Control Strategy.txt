    To the Congress of the United States:
Consistent with section 1005 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Public Law 100 - 690), I am today pleased to transmit my administration's 1990 National Drug Control Strategy for congressional consideration and action.
This report should be viewed as a companion volume to the National Drug Control Strategy that I sent to the Congress last September. In it you will find a comprehensive blueprint for Federal drug control activities for the next fiscal year. The principal goal of our strategy, however, remains the same: to reduce the level of illegal drug use in America. To help determine the most effective means of pursuing that objective, my administration has once again been aided by broad consultation with Members of Congress, Federal, State, and local officials, experts in the fields of drug prevention, treatment, and enforcement, and hundreds of interested and public-spirited citizens. The result, I believe, is a truly national plan to combat the illegal use of drugs, one that will bring us success in this new decade.
I am grateful for the enthusiastic and bipartisan support that the Congress gave to the National Drug Control Strategy last year, and I turn to you for that support again. I know that every Member of Congress shares my desire to overcome the terrible scourge of drugs. And so I ask you to join me in moving quickly to fund and implement the proposals and initiatives contained in this report. Full congressional support of this national strategy is essential if we are to give Americans the thorough and effective drug control policy they expect and deserve.
