    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Goodling (R) PA, Ford (D) MI, and Jeffords (R) VT)
The administration opposes H.R. 1728 because it would extend for five more years a demonstration program which began in 1982 and has been determined not to be effective. Under the demonstration, selected school districts received all of their subsidies for school lunches in cash or letters of credit instead of cash and farm commodities. The evaluation of the demonstration determined that assistance in cash and farm commodities provides better value from the School Lunch program.
