    Mitt Romney today announced the support of President George H.W. Bush.
"As a naval aviator, congressman, ambassador, CIA director, vice president, and president, George H.W. Bush served our country with great devotion and high distinction over many decades. When we talk about the Greatest Generation, we are talking about those like President Bush, who, after Pearl Harbor, enlisted in our armed forces and served with unflinching courage during World War II. This is a man who knows from the ground up — and from the top down — the meaning of responsibility in exercising leadership in our democracy.  I am proud to have him as my mentor. Ann and I are grateful to be able to call Barbara and George our good friends. There is no greater honor than earning President Bush's endorsement and I am grateful for all George and Barbara have done."
