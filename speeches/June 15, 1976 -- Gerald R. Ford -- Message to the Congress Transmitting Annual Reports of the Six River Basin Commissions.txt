    To the Congress of the United States:
I am happy to transmit herewith the annual reports of the six river basin commissions, as required under Section 204(2) of the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965.
The Act states that commissions may be established, comprised of State and Federal members, at the request of the Governors of the States within the proposed commission area. Each commission is responsible for planning the best use of water and related land resources in its area and for recommending priorities for implementation of such planning. The commissions, through efforts to increase public participation in the decisionmaking process, can and do provide a forum for all people within the commission area to voice their ideas, concerns, and suggestions.
The commissions submitting reports are New England, Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest, Ohio, Missouri, and Upper Mississippi. The territory these six cover include parts or all of 32 States.
The enclosed annual reports indicate the activities and accomplishments of the commissions during FY 1975. A brief description of current and potential problems, studies, and approaches to solutions are included in the reports.
