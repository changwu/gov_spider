THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: The Return of 3% Growth
"So much for 'secular stagnation.' You remember that notion, made fashionable by economist Larry Summers and picked up by the press corps to explain why the U.S. economy couldn't rise above the 2.2% doldrums of the Obama years. Well, with Friday's report of 4.1% growth in the second quarter, the U.S. economy has now averaged 3.1% growth for the last six months and 2.8% for the last 12. The lesson is that policies matter and so does the tone set by political leaders."
LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Donald Trump Reveling in Good Economic News
"The Trump economy continues to shine. On Friday, the Commerce Department announced the economy grew 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest for a three-month period in four years.

BOSTON HERALD EDITORIAL BOARD: So Far So Good On Economy
"The U.S. economy is supercharged. Second quarter growth rose to 4.1 percent. Although a full-on celebration of Trumponomics is premature, we must give him a lot of credit for the good news. Americans are spending their tax cuts and businesses are unrestrained by the burdensome regulations that hindered their growth potential for years. The president is pro-business to the core."
WASHINGTON EXAMINER EDITORIAL BOARD: From Doom to Boom
"The U.S. economy grew at an annualized 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the highest rate since 2014. Last quarter was the fifth straight with more than 2 percent growth, a streak we haven't seen since 2005-2006. The five full quarters of the Trump administration have averaged 3.19 percent."
