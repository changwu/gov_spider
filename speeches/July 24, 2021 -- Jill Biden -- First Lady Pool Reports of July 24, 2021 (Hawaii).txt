FLOTUS Pool Report No. 2 - Pearl Harbor-Hickam arrival 
Executive One Foxtrot taxied over to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, where we deplaned.
It's 86 degrees and breezy.
FLOTUS stepped off E1F at 12:52 p.m. She's wearing a lilac colored dress and her white floral Dior shoes.
Admiral John C. Aquilino gave her a lei when she greeted him. The governor's wife than gave her a lei. Rep. Case presented her with a third lei.
The Inouye family greeted her last. She spent a number of minutes speaking to them. She was given another lei by a young girl, presumably his daughter.
She said something complimentary about Hawaii as she walked by press. I'll see if TV got clear audio.
Her motorcade was rolling at 1 p.m.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 3 - quote from arrival 
After listening to audio pool believes she said,
"I'm really looking forward to being here in your beautiful state. I'm really looking forward to it."
And just a note - FLOTUS has now split off from pool for the remainder of the day, as she's staying at the Presidential Cottage at Marine Base Kaneohe.
