Pool report #12: Hanukkah event begins
?Biden entered the room at 5:41. First Lady Jill Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff entered with him. The East Room is packed with people sitting in rows of chairs.
Here are some details from the White House.
The Menorah used during this event is the Liberty Bell menorah, designed by Manfred Anson. It is on loan from the National Museum of American Jewish History (NMAJH), in Philadelphia. The artist, Manfred Anson (1922-2012), was a Holocaust survivor and collector of Judaica, who designed this menorah in honor of Philadelphia's very own Liberty Bell. The bells were cast from a souvenir tchotchke that Anson collected after immigrating to the US, and each is inscribed with the name of a Jewish American.
The Liberty Bell at Independence Hall in Philadelphia is inscribed with a passage from Leviticus (25:10), "Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants thereof." This phrase is featured prominently on the menorah.
Tonight's event will mark the first time Hanukkah is celebrated with a Jewish member of either the First or Second Family, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.

Pool report #13: Event ends
?The event ended at 6:10.
The White House sends this correction to its earlier note:
Tonight’s event will mark the first time Hanukkah is celebrated with a Jewish spouse of a President or Vice President, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.
(The previous note said it was the first time with a Jewish member of the First or Second Family, which was inaccurate because Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are Jewish.)
