    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4556, the "Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995."
The Act provides funding for the Department of Transportation and several smaller agencies, including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the National Transportation Safety Board.
This Act provides funding for a number of my high-priority investment proposals within the Department of Transportation. These include the core highway programs of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System research program, Mass Transit Formula Capital Grants, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and the Penn Station Redevelopment Project.
