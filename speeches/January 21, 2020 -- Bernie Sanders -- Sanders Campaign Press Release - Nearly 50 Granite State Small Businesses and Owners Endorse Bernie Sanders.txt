    MANCHESTER, N.H. — Sen. Bernie Sanders today welcomed endorsements from 49 small business owners representing 41 small businesses across all ten counties in New Hampshire.
In their endorsements, local businesses cited Sen. Sanders' unwavering support for the middle and working class, his leadership on Medicare for All, his championing of job creation while combating climate change, and his strong policy proposals to help rural America.
Shannon Jackson, Bernie 2020 New Hampshire State Director, said, "We are honored to have the support of hardworking small businesses and small business owners in every county of New Hampshire. Bernie proudly stands with small business, and under his Administration would ensure they are able to provide healthcare, contend with climate change, and create and safeguard just work environments for employees." Sen. Sanders has a long record of supporting small business, including standing up for small business in his Six-Point Plan to rein in Wall Street, supporting the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act, and in 2019 unveiling the Loan Shark Prevention Act with Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to combat the predatory lending practices of America's big banks. In 2018, small businesses in New Hampshire employed over 290,000 people. Among the businesses and business owners endorsing Sen. Sanders are Dennis Côté of Polly's Pancakes in Sugar Hill, Kaji Maharjan of Kathmandu Spice in Manchester, and Alex Ray of The Common Man which has locations across the state. "We overwhelmingly support Bernie Sanders for president because Bernie has the strongest policies when it comes to leveling the playing field for small farmers," said James and Marley Stever of Generation Farm, a small, certified organic farm in Concord. "Bernie also has the most comprehensive policies to address the climate crisis and social and economic justice. We trust that Bernie will do what he says. We are fighting for the survival of our planet and our democracy. This is not about us. Supporting Bernie means fighting for our collective future and we refuse to give up." "I believe in my heart and soul that Senator Bernie Sanders is the best and most qualified candidate for president," said Dr. Becky Mulkern of the Center for Natural Health. "He is the candidate that I trust to be president for all people. He is a tireless and dedicated worker in service of 'Us.' His progressive ideas will bring us together, help the economy, provide healthcare for all and defend our planet against climate change. We must elect Bernie Sanders to confront the challenges of our day and bring us into a future of health, true democracy and environmental stability."
