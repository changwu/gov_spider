PAUL RYAN: "You're going to hear a lot from President Obama and yes, from Joe Biden. You're hearing a little bit about Medicare these days. What they will not tell you is that they turned Medicare into a piggy bank to fund Obamacare. They took $716 billion from Medicare to pay for their Obamacare program. In Pennsylvania, 38 percent of Pennsylvania seniors chose to get their Medicare from a plan called Medicare Advantage. It's their choice. 47 percent of them are going to lose it under Obamacare according to Medicare by 2017. That's a $3600 cut in their benefits. So when it comes to who's protecting Medicare, who's being candid with our current seniors, and who is saying stop the raid on Medicare, that's what Mitt Romney and I are proposing."
