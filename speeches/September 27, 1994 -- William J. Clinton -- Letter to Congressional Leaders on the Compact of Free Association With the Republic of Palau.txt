    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
(Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In my letter of July 26, 1994, I reported that the voters of Palau had approved the Compact of Free Association with the United States, opening the way, 7 years after its approval by the Congress, for the Compact to be brought into force.
Along with my letter, in accordance with section 101 of the Compact of Free Association with Palau Act, Public Law 101-219 (December 12, 1989), section 101(d)(1)(C) and (2) of the Compact of Free Association Approval Act, Public Law 99-658 (November 14, 1986), and section 102(b) of the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985, Public Law 99-239 (January 14, 1986), I submitted the Economic Development Plan of the Republic of Palau, copies of certain subsidiary agreements between the United States and Palau, and an agreement between Palau and the United States establishing October 1, 1994, as the effective date for the Compact, provided that all lawsuits in Palau challenging approval of the Compact had been resolved by that date.
I have been advised by the Government of Palau that approval of the Compact is now free from any legal challenge in the courts of Palau and that the time for filing additional challenges has expired. Therefore, in addition to the findings and determinations that I reported in my July 26 letter, I am pleased to advise you that:
1. Pursuant to section 101(1) of Public Law 101-219, I have determined that the Compact was approved by the requisite percentage of votes cast in a referendum conducted pursuant to the Constitution of Palau and that such approval is free from any legal challenge.
2. Pursuant to section 101(2) of Public Law 101-219, the requisite 30 days in which either the House of Representatives or the Senate of the United States was in session have elapsed since my July 26 notification to the Congress of the October 1, 1994, effective date of the Compact.
3. Pursuant to section 101(d)(1)(A) of Public Law 99-658, I hereby certify that the Compact has been approved in accordance with section 411(a) and (b) of the Compact and that there exists no legal impediment to the ability of the United States to carry out fully its responsibilities and to exercise its rights under Title Three of the Compact.
4. Agreements have been concluded with Palau that satisfy the requirements of section 101(d)(1)(C) of Public Law 99-658.
5. The period of congressional review provided in section 102(b)(2)(B) of Public Law 99- 239 having elapsed, the United States hereby concurs with Palau's Economic Development Plan.
Therefore, all statutory conditions for implementation of the Compact having been met, I have issued the attached proclamation terminating the trust relationship between the United States and Palau and the entry into force of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republican of Palau, effective October 1, 1994, at one minute past one o'clock p.m. local time in Palau.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
