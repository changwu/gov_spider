    The President. I was just informed that the Senate will not vote out a stimulus package. I'm very disappointed. There's a lot of workers who hurt, and they need help. Our economy, while there's some good news, needs more stimulus. I still think we need to pass a bill that will help workers and help stimulate the economy. You know, we got a good bill out of the House, and I believe that we had a good chance to get a good bill out of the Senate last fall; there was enough votes to pass the bill. And I'm just disappointed. I think—I think we need a good stimulus package.
Q. [Inaudible]—for a regular breakfast this week?
The President. No, no, we're meeting next week. But I mean, I don't need to have a meeting, a breakfast to express my disappointment. I'm disappointed. I think people need to—workers need help, and I think we need to stimulate the economy with some wise policy. And we're working hard on this issue. I talked about it—gosh, I remember going to the Midwest to talk about it; I think I talked about in the Midwest right after the attacks. We've been working with both Republicans and Democrats to try to forge a good package. You know, I'm just sorry it hasn't happened. I hope they do reconsider and pass a good bill.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. I can't hear you.
Q. Are you saying they're not listening?
The President. You need to talk to them. I'm just—what I'm saying is, I'm disappointed we don't have a package. Workers need help, and we need to stimulate the economy.
Thank you all.
