    National Hispanic Corporation will honor Patti Solis Doyle at its 22nd Women's Conference
Clinton Campaign Manager Patti Solis Doyle is set to receive the "Latina Leadership Excellence Award" during the 22nd National Hispanic Women's Conference on Thursday, September 13, in Phoenix, Arizona. The high energy national conference will bring together over 2000 women, businesses, community leaders and public officials. Solis Doyle will also speak at a panel focused on encouraging Latinas to get involved in the national political arena. The event is organized by the non-profit Hispanic Women's Corporation (HWC).
"I am honored to receive this recognition," said Solis Doyle. "The work that organizations like the HWC do to empower and encourage Latinas to participate in the political arena is admirable. I congratulate the organization for their commitment to help improve the future of the Latino community."
"Patti has been a close advisor and friend for almost 16 years," said Hillary Clinton. "I am proud to see that her hard work and commitment to help bring change to our country is being recognized."
Patti Solis Doyle is the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton for President. She is the first Hispanic woman to lead a presidential effort in the United States -- working hard in a business where it is rare for females to lead major campaigns, and where minorities in key positions are even harder to find. Having stayed out of the limelight for years, Patti is recognized as an effective and low profile leader, with exceptional organizational and political abilities.
The Hispanic Women Corporation is a non-profit corporation known for being a proactive leader in the development of Hispanic women, founded in 1981. Their annual conference has grown to be the largest gathering of Latina women in the nation.
