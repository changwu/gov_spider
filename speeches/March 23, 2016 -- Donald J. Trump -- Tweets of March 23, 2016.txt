Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!Retweets: 16384Favorites: 36549

Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way!Retweets: 13381Favorites: 36749

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!Retweets: 7453Favorites: 26045

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!Retweets: 8202Favorites: 25925

Lyin' Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglasâ€” just another dishonest politician.Retweets: 5432Favorites: 15759

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin' Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can't blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!Retweets: 5390Favorites: 17969

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She's been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!Retweets: 11115Favorites: 27505

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I'm the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin' Ted & others are copying me.Retweets: 7224Favorites: 22344

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!Retweets: 5866Favorites: 19190

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!Retweets: 4020Favorites: 16942

I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!Retweets: 4736Favorites: 18046
