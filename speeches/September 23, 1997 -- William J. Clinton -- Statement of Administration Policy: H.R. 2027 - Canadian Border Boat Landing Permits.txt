    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(LaTourette (R) Ohio)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2027, which would exempt certain passengers entering the United States by boat along the U.S.-Canadian border from having to obtain a landing permit (form I-68). The bill is likely to create confusion because it would apply only to a small number of boaters and even those boaters would continue to be subject to U.S. Customs entry requirements.
The Administration is currently implementing a pilot program that is intended to achieve the objectives of H.R. 2027. Under the pilot, inspection via video-phone takes the place of a form I-68 and also serves as a Customs entry check.
