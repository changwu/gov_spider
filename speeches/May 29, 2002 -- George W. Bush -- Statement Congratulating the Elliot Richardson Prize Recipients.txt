    I congratulate Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget Alice Rivlin, and former Secretary of State George Shultz on their receipt of the first Elliot Richardson Prize for excellence and integrity in public service, awarded by the Council for Excellence in Government. Each of these distinguished public servants possesses the virtues embodied by Elliot Richardson: enduring commitment to the greater public good; a lifetime of public service; and courage, integrity, and diligence in the pursuit of excellence in Government.
Since September 11, Americans have demonstrated a renewed appreciation for the sacrifices that public servants make and for the commitment they bring to their jobs. The examples set by Secretary Powell, Director Rivlin, and Secretary Shultz stand as an inspiration to all Americans including our young people, especially those considering a career in Government service. Their lives serve as a testimony that public service is a noble calling.
