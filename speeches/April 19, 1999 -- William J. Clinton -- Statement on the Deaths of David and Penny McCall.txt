    Hillary and I are saddened to learn of the deaths of David and Penny McCall, two Americans who dedicated their lives to helping people in need around the world. They were killed in an auto accident, along with a French colleague, Yvette Pierpaoli, and their Albanian driver, while engaged in their life's work.
They were in Albania on a mission for Refugees International to explore the possibilities of setting up a region-wide radio network to help Kosovar-Albanian refugees locate lost family members.
By reaching out to help the Kosovar refugees and war-affected people throughout the world, they stood for the best of the American spirit. Our thoughts and prayers are with their loved ones.
