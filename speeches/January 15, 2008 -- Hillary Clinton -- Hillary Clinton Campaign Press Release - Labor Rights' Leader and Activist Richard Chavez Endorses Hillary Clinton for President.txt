    Brother of the Late Cesar Chavez to Campaign for Hillary
The Clinton campaign announced today the endorsement of labor rights' Richard Chavez, brother of the late Cesar Chavez. Richard will join Clinton's National Hispanic Leadership Council; he will advise on labor issues and Hispanic outreach efforts.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and the experience to lead our nation starting from day one. As someone who has spent a lifetime working very hard to improve the lives of working families, I applaud Hillary's commitment to create quality and affordable healthcare and to create fair wages for every American," said Richard Chavez. "I have no doubt that as President she will continue to fight tirelessly for all the underserved."
Richard Chavez worked with his brother Cesar Chavez for over twenty years until Cesar's death in 1993. Since then, Richard has carried on with his brother's lifetime commitment, touring the country and speaking about Cesar's life. He continues to fight for all that Cesar stood for: fair wages, healthcare, pension benefits and most importantly basic human living conditions for farm workers across of the United States.
"I am so excited to have Richard Chavez's support," said Senator Clinton. "The legacy of the Chavez family continues alive and well, but there's still so much change that needs to be delivered on behalf of hard working Americans. Together we will bring our message of change across the country."
