    Says Harris "knows what it takes to move us forward as a country"
Today, in an op-ed written exclusively for Essence Magazine, Congresswoman Jahana Hayes of Connecticut endorsed Senator Kamala Harris for President of the United States. Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, is the first black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress. She is the seventh member of the CBC to back Senator Harris' candidacy.
Citing her dominant debate performance and 3AM agenda, Hayes wrote that Senator Harris is "the perfect antidote to our current President's false narratives. With her intellect, strength and empathy at the helm, we can work to be better together. Senator Harris has laid out a powerful and bold vision for this country that is inclusive of everyone's lived experience and grounded in the belief that success should not be defined by race, gender, socioeconomic status or zip code."
"I'm so proud to have Jahana's support in this race," said Harris. "As a teacher and working mom, Jahana understands first-hand that our families are looking for leadership to solve the challenges that keep them up each night. She has stood in front and lifted up our nation's future leaders and was recognized as a champion not only in the classroom but for the residents of Connecticut. I'm glad to have her in this fight to give hard-working Americans a raise, pay teachers their value, and ensure access to affordable healthcare."
Hayes is the first federally elected official in Connecticut to endorse in the Democratic presidential primary. She joins fellow CBC members Barbara Lee of California, Al Green of Texas, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson of Florida, Wm. Lacy Clay of Missouri and Bobby Rush of Illinois in supporting Harris' candidacy.
