    President Bush met today with European Community Commission President Jacques Delors to discuss the development of relations between the United States and the European Community, an important part of U.S. relations with Europe. President Delors described the Community's continuing political and economic integration and the Community's developing relations with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. President Bush emphasized the United States traditional and continuing support for European integration and the importance the United States attaches to the Community's role as coordinator of a broad Western effort to aid Hungary and Poland, as well as other Eastern European countries as they move toward market economies and democracy.
President Bush and President Delors discussed the roles of the United States and the European Community in a changing Europe. They both stressed the need to further strengthen institutional links between the United States and the Community as the EC integration process progresses, and to refine procedures for continuing close political and economic consultations at all levels. President Bush said he was pleased with the progress made in this regard during the visit of Irish Prime Minister Haughey in February as President of the EC Council. The U.S.-EC Ministerial yesterday and President Bush's meeting today with President Delors should permit additional progress.
President Bush reiterated to Commission President Delors that the United States is firmly committed to improving the multilateral trading system and strengthening the GATT through agreements reached during the Uruguay round GATT negotiations scheduled to conclude in Brussels next December, and that the cooperation of the European Community is essential, particularly in the agricultural area.
