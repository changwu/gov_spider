It's the last day to vote early in-person in many parts of the Sunshine State.So if you're a Florida voter and want to skip the election day lines, take the Vote Early Day pledge: Pledge to vote for Marco tomorrow and to get three friends to do it with you!Team Marco volunteers are using the day to reach out to thousands and thousands of voters, and Marco's participating in early voting events across Florida.
There's even a custom Vote Early Day filter on the Snapchat app:

Across Florida, hundreds of thousands of Marco supporters have already cast their ballots ahead of the March 15th primary.
