    President Carter today announced selection of 17 prominent business, labor, and public figures to serve as members of the anti-inflation program's Pay Advisory Committee. They will serve with John Thomas Dunlop, a Harvard economics professor and former Secretary of Labor, who has accepted the Chairmanship of the Committee.
The President said on September 28 that he would name a committee to broaden public participation in the development and administration of the voluntary pay standard for the second year of the anti-inflation program. It was enlarged from 15 to 18 to provide for wider participation.
The Pay Advisory Committee will advise the Council on Wage and Price Stability on developing policies that encourage anti-inflationary pay behavior by employers and labor, in order to decelerate the rate of inflation and provide for fair and equitable distribution of the burden of restraint.
The Committee will recommend any modifications to the pay standard it considers necessary and to pay exception and noncompliance decisions of the Council. It will also recommend new or revised interpretations of the pay standard.
Members of the Committee were chosen after wide consultation with representatives of labor, business, and the general public.
The Committee will hold its first meeting at 10 a.m., Wednesday, October 17, in Room 2008 of the New Executive Office Building.
