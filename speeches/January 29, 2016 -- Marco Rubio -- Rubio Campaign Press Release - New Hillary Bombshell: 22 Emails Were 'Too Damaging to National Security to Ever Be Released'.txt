They're so sensitive, the State Department won't release them AT ALL — not even in censored form.
The Obama administration confirmed for the first time Friday that Hillary Clinton's unsecured home server contained closely guarded government secrets, censoring 22 emails with material requiring one of the highest levels of classification. The revelation comes just three days before the Iowa presidential nominating caucuses in which Clinton is a candidate.

Marco Rubio has been consistently making the case that Hillary Clinton is disqualified from serving as President. He reinforced his argument on the campaign trail in Iowa today.
