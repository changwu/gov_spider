    Volunteers Will Knock on tens of Thousands of Doors Across the State
Des Moines, IA -- The Obama for America Iowa campaign today will hold a statewide canvass in 82 communities in Iowa, knocking on tens of thousands of doors across the state. The day of action was kicked off by former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle from South Dakota, former Oklahoma U.S. Congressman Brad Carson, and former Governor of Mississippi Ray Mabus at a rally with volunteers in Des Moines. Daschle, Carson and Mabus said Senator Obama is the best candidate to move our country past red state and blue state divides and unite us on the values we share.
"I'm seeing in Mississippi what I'm seeing across the nation, people in both parties are excited about Senator Obama's candidacy and ready for a candidate who will bring people together and transform our country," Mabus said. "Barack Obama has experience bridging partisan division to make progress on our priorities and his widespread appeal across the political spectrum makes him the best candidate to lead America."
