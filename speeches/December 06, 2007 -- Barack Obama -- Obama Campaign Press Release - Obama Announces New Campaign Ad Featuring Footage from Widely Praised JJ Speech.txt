    Des Moines, IA - The Obama for America campaign today released a new campaign ad titled "Moment," which features footage from Obama's widely-praised Jefferson-Jackson dinner speech.
In the ad, Obama talks about his desire to move past the old "textbook" campaign that pits "red" vs. "blue" America.
The Washington Post called Obama's speech the "oratorical winner". The Des Moines Register's David Yepsen called the speech "moving" and "excellent" and said it could be a "turning point" in the campaign.
