Rand is someone I disagree with on a lot of issues, but as I said the other night at the debate, he actually believes strongly in what he stands for and I respect that. He is a true believer on issues of limited government and the liberty issues, and I respect him for that. I thought he ran a good race and obviously he is going to run for re-election to the Senate, and we wish him well in that endeavor.
. . .Â We would love to have everybody's support, and obviously, we will work hard to earn the support of some of the people that were helping him. As I said, we have had some policy disagreements on foreign policy. But by and large, one thing I respect about Rand is that he is a true and real believer in what he stands for. The liberty movement needs to be a part of the conservative Republican coalition, so we would welcome them in as part of unifying this party, absolutely.
