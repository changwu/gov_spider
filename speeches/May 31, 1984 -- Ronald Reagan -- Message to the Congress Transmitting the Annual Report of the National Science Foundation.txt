    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send you the annual report of the National Science Foundation for fiscal year 1983. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and information sciences; in engineering; and in education for those fields.
The National Science Foundation is a key part of the national effort to revitalize our capabilities in research, innovation, and production. Achievements such as those described here underlie much of this Nation's strengthâ€”its economic growth, military security, and the general well-being of our people.
I hope you will share my enthusiasm for this fine work.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
May 31, 1984.
