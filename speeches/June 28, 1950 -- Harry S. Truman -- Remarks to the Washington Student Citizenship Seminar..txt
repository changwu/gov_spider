    THANK YOU very much.
It is a pleasure to have you in this afternoon. I hope you are getting some practical ideas on what your Government is like, and what it is supposed to do.
Government is an intangible thing. It is what we make it. It is supposed to be a service organization for the benefit of all the people, and I hope you will find that that is substantially what we try to do here in Washington.
You will all, I know, get the definition of a bureaucrat, and maybe you will turn out to be a bureaucrat, some day--can't tell.
You might define a bureaucrat as a man or woman who works for the Government in a job that somebody else wants.
I hope you have gotten some constructive information and that you will go home and put in your time trying to make yourselves better citizens of this great Government of ours.
Thank you very much.
