    The President has directed the Attorney General to identify any Iranian students in the United States who are not in compliance with the terms of their entry visas, and to take the necessary steps to commence deportation proceedings against those who have violated applicable immigration laws and regulations.
As an initial measure, the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice will issue a notice requiring all Iranian students to report their present location and status immediately to the nearest INS office, and will take additional steps to locate and identify such students to determine legal status. For students found to be in illegal status, deportation proceedings will be conducted in accordance with constitutional due process requirements.
