    'Secure' affirms Dr. Paul's defense bona fides
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced today the release of a new national security-themed television ad that is part of a seven-figure ad push that began two weeks ago.
The 30-second ad titled "Secure"cements Dr. Paul's reputation as a leader who is fully prepared to deal with authentic threats to U.S. national security and ready to be the nation's commander-in-chief. The spot will air beginning today on cable and broadcast television in the key early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.
"Ron Paul is the only Republican presidential candidate to put forth the notion that a strong national defense means ending destructive unconstitutional wars having an unclear connection to national security, ending costly state-building in regions where our presence is unwanted, and bringing hundreds of thousands of troops home to make America safer and cut overseas spending," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"This ad will affirm Dr. Paul's standing as the best candidate to face issues pertaining to national security all in the context of refocusing our efforts on protecting America's borders and threats that might arrive on America's soil, not foreign lands," said Mr. Benton.
