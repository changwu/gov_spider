    ON THIS Armed Forces Day over e million American servicemen and women stand ready, as always, to defend our freedom. This day provides an occasion for Americans everywhere to pay tribute to them.
As we begin what promises to be an era of reduced world tensions, we must not forget the contribution which our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coast guardsmen make to the strength and security of the free world. We must never lose sight of the fact that our continued military strength is the cornerstone of future peace.
Once again, as in the days of George Washington, our Armed Forces are being manned by volunteers. In restoring that honorable tradition we must demonstrate our continuing support for the members of our Armed Forces. The guardians of America's liberties deserve the admiration and respect of those they defend.
Armed Forces Day 1974 provides each of us with a specific opportunity to express our appreciation to America's men and women in uniform, and to their families. In demonstrating our support for them we can help ensure that our Armed Forces of tomorrow will continue to be composed of dedicated, professional, and courageous young citizens--the finest our society has to offer.
