MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS: "You talk about the struggles that you've been through in our life and faith I'm sure has been a big part of getting you through those. How do you feel that that has served you as a wife and mother?"
ANN ROMNEY: "You have a choice when you're hit with something really hard, and you can curl and just give up or you can just push and keep going. And for me, for a while, I have to tell you it was really difficult, and I felt like doing the first and feeling very sorry for myself, but then you have the resources of the people that you love around you, and giving you encouragement but then you finally learn how to dig really deep and to say, 'I'm going to get through this.' I think it has changed my heart. It has softened my heart. It's made me very concerned about others that are going through challenges, and know that we'll all have a dark hour in our life. There are people that are suffering right now, they may be losing their mothers or losing a child or they're losing a spouse, or they are being diagnosed with cancer. And there's people right now [that] are going through enormous challenges. And so for me, I am grateful that my heart has been opened up and softened, and that I can appreciate and understand when someone is going through a challenge, what it feels like."
