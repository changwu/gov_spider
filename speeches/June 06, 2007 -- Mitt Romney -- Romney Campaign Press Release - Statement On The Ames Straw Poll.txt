Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President spokesman Kevin Madden issued the following statement on the Ames Straw Poll:
"Governor Romney has put in the time, built the organization and communicated his message to the voters of Iowa. It's a message focused on bringing conservative change to Washington, and it is resonating with Iowa voters because it matches his record of accomplishment as governor.
"Our plan all along has been to play in the Iowa straw poll, and that hasn't changed. Campaigns that have decided to abandon Ames are likely doing so out of a recognition that their organizations are outmatched and their message falls flat with Republican voters in Iowa.
"It looks as if we just beat those campaigns in Iowa two months earlier than we had planned on beating them."
