After spending 40 Million Dollars reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents & interviewing 500 people with the total support of the White House the Mueller Report was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to the Democrats so they want a DO OVER. It doesn't work that way-so bad for our Country!Retweets: 17487Favorites: 68302

The Democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Dems. Never happened to a president before. Never even happened to President Obama!Retweets: 19875Favorites: 81654

John Brennan on the Mueller probe 'I don't know if I received bad information but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS.' Wow he admits he was wrong! Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc.Retweets: 19411Favorites: 72769

Everything the Democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the Mueller Report came back with a NO COLLUSION finding. Now they say Impeach President Trump even though he did nothin wrong while they 'fish!'Retweets: 17591Favorites: 68880

Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings. Problem is the Haters say that is not a new Wall but rather a renovation. Wrong and we must build where most needed....Retweets: 19481Favorites: 96019

Everybody including me thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others) that was the end. But no the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. Bad for the Country!Retweets: 17563Favorites: 69700

So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country. They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America or get back to work....Retweets: 30992Favorites: 135206
