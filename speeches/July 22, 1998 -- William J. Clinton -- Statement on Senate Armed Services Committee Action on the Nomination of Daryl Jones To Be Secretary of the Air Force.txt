    I am deeply disappointed that the Senate Armed Services Committee declined to send to the full Senate the nomination of Daryl Jones to be Secretary of the Air Force. Mr. Jones has a distinguished record of public service in Florida and a strong commitment to the Air Force. I know him to be a good, decent, able man. He was an outstanding candidate for this position, and he deserved the opportunity to be considered by the full Senate. I appreciate the support he received from Chairman Thurmond, Senator Levin, and many other Senators in both parties. I thank Mr. Jones for his willingness to serve his country. I am confident that he will continue to make vital contributions to Florida and to our Nation.
