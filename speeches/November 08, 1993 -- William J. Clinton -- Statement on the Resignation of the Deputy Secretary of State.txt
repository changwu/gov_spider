    I accept with regret the resignation offered today by Clifton Wharton, who has served our country honorably as Deputy Secretary of State. My administration has benefited greatly from his dignified presence, and it will be diminished by his departure.
Clifton Wharton's service as Deputy Secretary has been outstanding. Over the past 10 months, he has made many important contributions to our Nation's foreign policy. Through his leadership on reform of AID and other foreign assistance programs and his important work on the reorganization of the State Department, as well as through his successful mission to Southeast Asia and his prodigious efforts in Latin America, he has distinguished himself at every turn. Every aspect of his service has demonstrated the same drive and talent that marked his earlier successes in the worlds of business and education.
I know that Cliff is dedicated to our country's service. I continue to need and value his insights and counsel, and I hope to be able to continue calling on him for specific assignments in the days ahead. He and his family have my fondest wishes for a successful future.
