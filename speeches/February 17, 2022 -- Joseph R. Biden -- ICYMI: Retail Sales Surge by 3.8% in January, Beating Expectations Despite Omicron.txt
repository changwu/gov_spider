    Retail sales data released yesterday showed a surge in spending, with sales increasing by 3.8% in January over December. This is a strong increase, even after accounting for inflation, and reflects the resilience of the economy even in the face of Omicron. Compared to this time last year, sales at grocery stores, restaurants and clothing stores have all increased.
These figures underscore the Biden Administration's record economic growth and recovery, with a record number of jobs produced in 2021, and continued growth in inflation-adjusted household income and small business applications.
