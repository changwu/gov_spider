It requires all advertisements for the sale of such securities in interstate commerce to carry definite informative facts that will put the purchaser on notice. It changes the ancient doctrine of caveat emptor to "let the seller beware," and puts the burden on the seller rather than on the buyer. It should give a great impetus to honest dealing in securities and bring back public confidence in the sale of securities.
