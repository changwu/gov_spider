Fox News' "Special Report"
September 16, 2008
Fox News' Brit Hume: "It is widely agreed in the mainstream media that John McCain falsely accused Barack Obama of supporting a bill that provided sex education for kindergarteners. The McCain campaign made the assertion in a campaign ad released last week. The Washington Post called the ad 'dishonest and deceptive.' The New York Times said, quote, 'At most, kindergarteners were to be taught the dangers of sexual predators.'
"But it appears those critics have not read the bill which Obama backed as an Illinois State Senator in 2003. It says curriculum in, quote, 'Any of grades K through 12 shall include instruction on the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including the prevention, transmission and spread of HIV,' end quote. The Obama camp maintains the bill was intended to teach kindergarteners only about inappropriate touching, but Byron York, at the National Review after doing some reporting, writes, quote, 'the "touching" provision did not have the prominence that Team Obama has suggested it had, and certainly wasn't the bill's main purpose.'"
