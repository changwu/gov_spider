    On September 30–October 1, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols traveled to Haiti in his first official visit as Assistant Secretary to underscore U.S. commitment to the people of Haiti. He was accompanied by National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mark Wells.
As part of the U.S. Government's ongoing engagement with a broad range of stakeholders invested in Haiti's future, the delegation met with representatives from Haitian civil society, including the Montana Group, as well as political stakeholders to reaffirm U.S. support for inclusive Haitian-led solutions to Haitian challenges that strengthen Haiti's institutions. The delegation also met with Prime Minister Ariel Henry and Foreign Minister Claude Joseph to reiterate U.S. commitment to humane repatriation of migrants, a desire for a full and transparent investigation into President Moise's assassination, and to recognize that improving the security situation in Haiti is of critical importance to both Haiti and the United States.
The United States is a steadfast partner to Haiti, and the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to supporting the Haitian people during this challenging time. As President Biden has said, the United States remains as committed, as ever, to Haiti's future.
