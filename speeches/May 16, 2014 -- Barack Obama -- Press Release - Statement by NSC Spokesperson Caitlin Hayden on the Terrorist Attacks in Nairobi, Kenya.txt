    The United States condemns today's despicable terrorist attacks in the Gikoma market area of Nairobi, Kenya, that took the lives of many and injured dozens more. This is the latest in a series of cowardly attacks on innocent civilians in Kenya, from the capital to the coast. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who were killed and injured. As we have for half a century, the United States stands with our Kenyan friends and partners who continue to face adversity with courage and resolve. We support them in their efforts to confront terrorism in all of its forms.
