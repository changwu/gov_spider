    New program – unveiled at www.hillaryclinton.com – comes as campaign drew $15 million online in March
The Clinton campaign today announced the launch of MyPA, a new online fundraising drive that enables donors to tell the campaign where they'd like to spend their money in Pennsylvania. MyPA is a unique program that will further empower the campaign's grassroots supporters while continuing to raise the resources needed to compete and win in Pennsylvania.
Supporters will be notified about MyPA today through an email from Hillary announcing the program. By visiting www.hillaryclinton.com, supporters can choose from six different areas to support the campaign: TV airtime; online ads; radio spots; signs; vans; and door hangers. Supporters can mix and match how much they want to put towards each item and then "check out" like an online wedding registry.
The launch comes as the campaign had its second most successful online fundraising month, netting $15 million in March, more than double the amount raised online in January.
"Our grassroots supporters have come through once again, with over $15 million in contributions in the month of March," Internet Director Peter Daou said. "We are gratified to see such a continued show of strength."
