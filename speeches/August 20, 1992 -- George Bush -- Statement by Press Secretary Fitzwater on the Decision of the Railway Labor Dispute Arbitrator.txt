    On August 18, 1992, the President received for his review the decision of the arbitrator in the one remaining railway labor dispute associated with the shutdown of the Nation's railroads in late June. This decision was rendered pursuant to the arbitration process established by the Congress and concerns the dispute between the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and the American Train Dispatchers Association. The decision becomes final and binding upon the parties unless the President disapproves it within 3 days following its receipt.
The President has decided that he will not disapprove this decision. The President is grateful to the arbitrator for his work in resolving this dispute.
