    President Bush will visit Budapest, Hungary for a bilateral program on June 22, 2006, following his participation in the U.S.-European Union Summit in Vienna, Austria. In Budapest, the President will celebrate Hungary's historic sacrifices in the name of freedom by commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, underscore the success of the U.S.-European partnership in securing freedom in the region, and highlight the lessons offered from Hungary's successful transition from tyranny to free-market democracy.
Hungary is a close NATO ally, sharing its experiences with emerging democracies and committed to the war on terror. Hungary has made important contributions in support of democracy and security in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The President looks forward to the opportunity to continue his discussions on our transatlantic agenda with President Laszlo Solyom and Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany.
