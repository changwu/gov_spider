    The President and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed to assume joint patronage of a Federal Chancellor Scholarship for Future American Leaders, to commence in 1990.
This scholarship program is the result of a proposal made by the Chancellor while hosting American university representatives in July 1988, with a view to intensifying German-American academic cooperation. The Chancellor's purpose in launching this initiative was to make people of both countries, especially the younger generations, more acutely aware of the fundamental importance of the strong ties and close friendship between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.
The President and Chancellor Kohl are agreed that this year, which marks the 40th anniversary of the Federal Republic, is a particularly important time for launching such a program. They share the view that it is in the vital interest of both countries to broaden the foundations of their common future in the academic sphere and among the new generation of political leaders.
