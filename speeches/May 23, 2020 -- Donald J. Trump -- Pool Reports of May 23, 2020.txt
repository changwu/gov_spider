 In town pool report #3/ golf 
President Trump is returning to the golf course on this pleasant, sunny Saturday.
The president's motorcade arrived at Trump National in Sterling, Va., at 1027 am after a 35 minute drive along a route with sparse traffic but that was otherwise unremarkable. We did not see the president upon arrival. There were no protesters but several joggers and bikers outside the club.
I've requested details from the White House on the president's activities/ schedule today and will forward if those are forthcoming.
Pool was temperature checked but not tested for coronavirus. We are holding in the tennis pavilion.
