    "As President Trump leads our country and takes unprecedented action in stopping the coronavirus, it is now clearer than ever that no leaders exist on the Democrat debate stage. Unable to articulate a coronavirus plan, both Bernie and Biden offered little more than plagiarizing President Trump's response, which will now be the model for all future pandemics.
"Both Bernie and Biden proved themselves to be two sides of the same coin: offering a complete government takeover of the healthcare system which would destroy employer-provided insurance for 180 million Americans. Both embraced reckless and dangerous immigration policies that would imperil our citizens, and both pledged to kill fossil fuel industries that employ millions of people. It doesn't matter which of these two is the Democrat nominee, either one would reverse the hottest economy in modern history and the great gains we have made under President Trump."
