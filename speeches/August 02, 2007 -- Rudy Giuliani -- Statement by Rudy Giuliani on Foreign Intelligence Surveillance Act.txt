    Mayor Rudy Giuliani today released the following statement on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act:
"It is very dangerous to play politics with national security at a time when our Intelligence Community has just warned us that Al Qaeda is regrouping and continues to plan attacks against our country. Yet that is precisely what the Democrats are doing by preventing a vote on changing the archaic FISA law to bring it up to date with modern technology. The Democrats have been sitting on this since April, and they have refused to even schedule a vote before they go on their summer vacation. Al Qaeda isn't going on vacation; neither should the Democrats until they agree to fix FISA."
