    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€” Public Policy Polling on Thursday released a new survey of voters in Washington state.
"Hillary Clinton continues to be dominant at 57% to 24% for Bernie Sanders, 4% for Martin O'Malley, 2% for Jim Webb, and 1% for Lincoln Chafee. This is another data point showing that Sanders has far separated himself from the rest of the Democratic field in the race for 2nd place- he has 58% name recognition with the O'Malley/Webb/Chafee trio only coming in the 26-31% range," the pollster said.
