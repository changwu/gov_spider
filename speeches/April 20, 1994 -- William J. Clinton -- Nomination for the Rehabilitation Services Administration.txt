    The President today announced his intention to nominate Fredric K. Schroeder as Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration at the Department of Education.
"As one who gradually became blind as a teenager, Dr. Schroeder knows all too well the challenges facing people with disabilities," the President said. "He has devoted his life to empowering disabled people, and I'm confident he will continue in his new assignment to help disabled Americans achieve their goals."
