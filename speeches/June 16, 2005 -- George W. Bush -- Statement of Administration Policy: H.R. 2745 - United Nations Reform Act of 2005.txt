    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Hyde (R) Illinois; 1 cosponsor)
The Administration strongly supports reform of the United Nations (UN), including greater accountability, oversight, and results-based budgeting. We are actively engaged in that effort, along with a number of like-minded UN member states. The Administration appreciates the work of the House International Relations Committee to promote reform at the UN. However, the Administration has serious concerns with H.R. 2745 as reported, which could detract from and undermine our efforts, and asks that Congress reconsider this legislation.
The Administration objects to the bill's certification requirements which could result in a 50-percent reduction in the United States-assessed contribution to the UN. The Administration also opposes provisions of the bill that purport to require the President to direct the U.S. Ambassador to the UN to take particular actions in the Ambassador's dealings with the UN. Other provisions purport to establish policies for the United States with respect to its relations with the United Nations. These provisions impermissibly infringe on the President's authority under the Constitution to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs. The Administration also has a number of other objections to the bill.
The Administration would look forward to working with Congress to develop the kind of bicameral effort that will lead to meaningful UN reform.
