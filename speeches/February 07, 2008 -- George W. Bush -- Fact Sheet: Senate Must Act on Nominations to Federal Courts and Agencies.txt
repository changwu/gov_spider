    President Bush Calls On The Senate To Give A Prompt Vote To More Than 180 Highly-Qualified Nominees Now Awaiting Confirmation
Today, President Bush called on the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional duty to give pending nominations a prompt vote and ensure Federal courts and agencies have the personnel they need to best serve the American people. There are more than 180 highly-qualified nominees awaiting a fair vote in the Senate. Of these nominees, 30 have been waiting more than a year for a Senate vote, about half have been waiting 100 days or longer, and nine nominees have been waiting more than two years. The Senate's continued delay in confirming these nominees means good people are becoming increasingly discouraged from entering into public service.

The Senate Judiciary Committee currently has 28 pending nominations for Federal judgeships before it. On February 21, the Committee will hold its first hearing for a circuit court nominee since September of last year. Four district court nominees are scheduled for a hearing on February 12. No judicial nominees are pending before the full Senate.
  
Approximately 160 non-judicial nominees continue to wait for the chance to serve our Nation. The nominations before the Senate are for vital positions affecting issues from the economy, to public safety, to national security. Some of these important agencies are unable to function until a nominee is confirmed. Even after the tragedies at the Sago Mine in West Virginia and Crandall Canyon in Utah, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission cannot decide cases because it has more vacancies than members.

The Senate Must Act Now To Fill Critical Seats On Our Nation's Courts
The Senate continues to refuse taking simple up-or-down votes on President Bush's 28 nominees for Federal judgeships. Many of America's courts are understaffed and overworked by too many vacancies while the Senate stands in the way of outstanding candidates who could relieve some of the burden. Eleven of the President's judicial nominees stand ready to take posts that have been declared judicial emergencies, yet the Senate has refused to give them an up-or-down vote.


    The President has nominated 10 men and women to the U.S. Courts of Appeals to fill the vacancies in six circuits serving 19 States, two territories, and Washington, D.C., but all of these nominees are stalled in the Senate.

Three circuit court nominees were first nominated in June 2006 and have been waiting for a fair up-or-down vote in the Senate ever since.
Six of the 10 circuit court nominees have been waiting more than six months for a vote by the full Senate.
The President has nominated three qualified individuals to serve in the 4th Circuit Court, where one-third of the judgeships are vacant. The Senate must move immediately to confirm judges to these unacceptable vacancies.





    The President has 18 nominees waiting for a Senate vote to serve U.S. district courts in 14 States.

Two candidates were nominated over a year ago to vacancies declared judicial emergencies, but have yet to receive a hearing.
Fifteen of the nominees for district judges have been pending before the Judiciary Committee for over 75 days.



The Senate Also Must Confirm Nominees Who Will Help Protect America's National Security
The Senate has not voted on seven nominations for senior leadership positions at the Department of Justice (DOJ) that remain vacant. DOJ helps protect the public from the threat of terrorism and ensures the fair and partial administration of justice for all Americans, and the Senate has a responsibility to confirm the leaders charged with these tasks.
The Senate Must Act To Ensure Our Government Has The People It Needs To Address Economic Uncertainties
The President now lacks two of the three top economists that serve as members of his Council of Economic Advisers. Senate leaders have pledged to do all that they can to ensure the Government takes action on the economy, yet they refuse to confirm the very people waiting to advise the President on the best ways to keep our economy growing. After nearly six months of awaiting a confirmation hearing, Dennis Carlton withdrew his name from consideration in the Senate. Donald Marron, who was nominated last summer, is still awaiting confirmation after more than seven months.
Three of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors have been awaiting Senate confirmation since May 2007. The Federal Reserve Board was established by Congress to ensure our country has a safe and stable financial system, yet in this time of economic uncertainty the Senate is standing in the way of respected experts who could help guide the Federal Reserve's critical decisions.
The Senate Must Act To Provide Our Government With The People It Needs To Ensure Public Safety And Health
Because of Senate delays, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has operated for more than three months without a confirmed director. The President appreciates the Senate Commerce Committee scheduling a hearing for nominee Bobby Sturgell in February, but it remains important that he and other nominees receive a swift up-or-down vote, rather than waiting for months after their hearing. Given the crucial role the FAA plays in ensuring the safety of the flying public, and at a time when air traffic congestion is a serious concern and Americans are experiencing record delays, it is irresponsible for the Senate to prevent a proven leader from taking on this public safety responsibility.
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission cannot decide cases because it currently has more vacancies than members. President Bush has nominated qualified people to fill all three vacant spots on the Commission, yet two of his nominees have been waiting more than a year for a Senate hearing. These nominees need to be confirmed to enable the Mine Safety Commission to decide cases and penalize mines that commit safety violations.
To ensure that the U.S. has the safest transportation system in the world, the Senate needs to take action to confirm leadership for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB is the lead investigator of any significant transportation accidents, such as the Minnesota bridge collapse. The President nominated two candidates for this Board last October, but the Senate has yet to give them an up-or-down vote.
The Senate has failed to vote on nominations to the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, leaving this five-member board with only three people in place. President Bush nominated two individuals to serve on this board more than six months ago. This independent Federal agency is responsible for investigation of industrial chemical accidents, and continual vacancies on the Board will inhibit its ability to respond effectively to crises as they arise.
Six nominees – comprising a substantial portion of the agency's leadership – are now awaiting confirmation for positions at the Department of Health and Human Services. These positions oversee important programs that provide health care and social services to our children and seniors and protect the Nation's public health. Millions of Americans rely on these programs every day, and the Senate has a responsibility to take action and give them an up-or-down vote.
