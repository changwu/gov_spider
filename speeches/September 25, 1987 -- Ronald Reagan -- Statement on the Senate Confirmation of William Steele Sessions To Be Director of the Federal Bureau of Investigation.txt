    I am pleased that the Senate today unanimously confirmed my nomination of Judge William Steele Sessions to be the new Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We can be sure that he will continue to distinguish himself as he has since 1974 on the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, where he served as Chief Judge for the last 7 years. His background on this court as well as his prior experiences as U.S. attorney and Chief of the Government Operations Section of the Criminal Division in the Department of Justice have prepared him well to carry on the Bureau's great tradition of "Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity."
In this bicentennial year of our Constitution all Americans can be proud to have a man of Judge Sessions' character and integrity leading the FBI in the fight against crime, all the while bearing witness to the Nation's unswerving commitment to due process of law. Judge Sessions embodies the ideal that the enforcement of our laws must be very tough, but very fair. Under the direction of Judge Sessions, the FBI will carry on its crucial responsibility to safeguard our persons, our property, and our constitutional rights.
