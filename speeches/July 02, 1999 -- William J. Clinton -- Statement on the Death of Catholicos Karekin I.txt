    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. I have sent my condolences to the Vicar General at the Holy See of Echmiadzin.
His Holiness was widely respected for his deep scholarship, his deep sense of principle, and his sincere devotion to the broadest possible ecumenical dialog. To all who followed his inspired leadership in Armenia, the United States, and around the world, I offer heartfelt sympathy and condolences on behalf of myself and the American people. All the members of the Armenian Apostolic Church are in our thoughts and our prayers.
