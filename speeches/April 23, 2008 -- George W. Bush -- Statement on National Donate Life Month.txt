    During National Donate Life Month, we show our appreciation for our fellow Americans who have saved lives by becoming organ, tissue, marrow, and blood donors, and we honor the health care professionals, researchers, and others involved in this lifesaving work. I was pleased today to meet with organ donors, medical professionals, and organ recipients, all of whom participated in a historic six-recipient kidney transplant in which six patients received new organs from six unrelated living donors. This history-making medical event took place 3 weeks ago at Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center. These people are all firsthand witnesses to the gift of life, or, in this case, lives.
We are blessed to have a health care system that is the best in the world and includes skilled medical professionals like those I met with today. We are also blessed to be a nation filled with generous and compassionate people. The selflessness of those who are donors is an inspiration.
Unfortunately, thousands of Americans are on waiting lists for an organ or tissue transplant. I urge all Americans to make the decision to donate. For information about becoming an organ and tissue donor, go to organdonor.gov. Talk to your family, talk to your friends, and register. You can give a transforming gift of life.
