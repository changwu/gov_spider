Thank you all so much for coming. 18 more days, we're going to get this done. You all are -- (applause.) So I want -- that I just want you to know that you all -- your support, your focus, your hard work, your energy -- do not underestimate how much that means to me and the President. When times get -- you have those ups and downs. So always know that we have such -- people who believe in a country that helps everyone, and that is moving forward and making the kind of progress we know we want for our kids and our grandkids.
