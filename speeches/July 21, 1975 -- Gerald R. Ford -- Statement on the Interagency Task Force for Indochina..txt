    I AM today formally announcing the transfer of principal operational responsibility of the Interagency Task Force for the resettlement of refugees from Indochina from the Department of State to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Since I formed the Task Force in April, the resettlement of refugees has become primarily a domestic rather than foreign affairs concern. A great deal has been accomplished in evacuating, caring for, and resettling refugees from Indochina. However, much remains to be done. I ask all Americans to open their hearts to these refugees as we have to others throughout our history.
Mrs. Julia Taft, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, who has been acting as Director of the Task Force since the departure of Ambassador Dean Brown, will continue as Director. All decisions and activities regarding the domestic and international resettlement of refugees from Indochina will be coordinated by her. She will act under my direction and in close coordination with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the President's Advisory Committee on Refugees. Mrs. Taft's responsibilities will continue to involve numerous governmental departments, and I am directing each of them to offer her their full cooperation and support in this important task.
