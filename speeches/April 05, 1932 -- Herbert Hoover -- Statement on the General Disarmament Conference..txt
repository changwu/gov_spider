    THE PRESIDENT said:
"Some 2 months ago I presented to our delegation to the Arms Conference at Geneva certain ideas which I believed would contribute to a solution of some of the problems before the Conference, and which were incorporated in the general program by our delegation to the Conference. These ideas have been more fully discussed and developed during the visit to Washington of Mr. Norman Davis and in consultation with the Secretary of State and our Army and naval advisers, with a view of enlarging their scope and application.
"With the months that pass, the economic burden and menace to world peace have, if anything, increased. The world needs the reduction of Government expenditure and the spirit of peace that can come from some degree of successful issue by the Disarmament Conference at Geneva. I have, therefore, asked the Secretary of State to go to Geneva, in order to explore with our delegates and those of other nations the possibility of taking more definite steps in that direction. It is the American desire to produce some concrete and definite results, even though they may not be revolutionary. The world needs, both economically and spiritually, the relief that can come from some degree of successful issue by the Disarmament Conference. This is the sole purpose of the Secretary's visit. There will be no discussion or negotiation by the Secretary on the debt question."
