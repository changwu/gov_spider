    I am honored to bestow the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Baldrige Award on businesses and schools which have set a standard for quality. These winners remind us that excellence in all organizations strengthens our Nation.
I am especially pleased that this year's awards include the first Baldrige education winners. They illustrate that the quality of education for children can be improved with innovative programs. These organizations demonstrate that improving the quality of education for all children is everyone's business.
