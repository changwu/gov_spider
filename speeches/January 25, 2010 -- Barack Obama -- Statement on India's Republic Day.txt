    I send my warmest wishes on behalf of the American people to the people of India and to those here in America and around the world who are celebrating Republic Day. As the world's largest democracies, the United States and India have a strong shared belief in the values of liberty, pluralism, and religious tolerance.
This Republic Day is particularly special because it marks India's Diamond Jubilee. In the 60 years since the Indian Constitution was adopted, we have built a strong and vibrant partnership. I was pleased that Prime Minister Singh was the honored guest for the first state dinner of my Presidency. It was a chance to celebrate the great and growing partnership between our two nations and the friendship between our peoples. Indeed, the more than 2 million Indian Americans in the United States enrich every corner of our great Nation, leading in government, science, industry, and the arts. And as our peoples continue to build upon that friendship, let our Governments continue to work together to advance peace, prosperity, and stability around the globe.
