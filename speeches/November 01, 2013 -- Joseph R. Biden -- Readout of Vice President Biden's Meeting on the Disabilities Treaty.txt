    This morning, the Vice President and Valerie Jarrett met with leaders of national disabilities and veteran's advocacy groups to express the Administration's strong support for ratification of the Disabilities Treaty. The United States has long been a global leader in promoting equality and dignity for people with disabilities. In his meeting, the Vice President reinforced the Administration's commitment to carrying forward that important legacy by urging Senate approval of the Treaty. He noted that ratifying the Treaty would help ensure that Americans with disabilities, including our veterans and wounded warriors, have the same opportunities to work, study, and travel in other countries as any other American. Vice President Biden stressed his strong belief that people with disabilities around the world should enjoy the same access and opportunity as their fellow citizens, and that the United States should stand at the forefront, encouraging other countries to meet the same high standards that the United States has already put in place.
