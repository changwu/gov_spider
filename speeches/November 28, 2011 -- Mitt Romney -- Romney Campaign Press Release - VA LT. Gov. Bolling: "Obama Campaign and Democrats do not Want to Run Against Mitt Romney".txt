    Virginia Lieutenant Governor and Romney for President Virginia Campaign Chairman Bill Bolling made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"With millions of Americans unemployed across the country, it is clear that President Obama's policies are not working to get our economy back on track. The President has failed to create jobs and has instead proposed job-killing regulations. It is clear from their latest attack that the Obama campaign and Democrats do not want to run against Mitt Romney and be held accountable for three years of failure."
