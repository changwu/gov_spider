    To Senator Byrd
I urge favorable action at the earliest possible time on H.R. 8588, a bill to reorganize and consolidate audit and investigation functions and to create offices of Inspector General in twelve major domestic departments and agencies. It is a reflection of the importance of this legislation that with this Administration's support, House approval of this bill earlier this year was nearly unanimous.
The new offices created by the bill will consolidate existing audit and investigation resources under the direction of a single, Presidentially appointed official in each agency. These offices will be charged with rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse in agency programs.
I can assure the Congress that the new framework established by the bill will be put to a good and vigorous use. I intend to nominate people of the highest integrity and ability to head these offices, and I will instruct my department and agency heads to support their efforts fully.
We are pleased to have worked with the Congress, in particular with Senators Ribicoff and Eagleton, and Representatives Brooks and Fountain, in fashioning this legislation. The reorganization of audit and investigation activities complements other initiatives the Administration has underway to fight fraud and abuse in Government, including the strong whistleblower protection provisions in the civil service reform bill, and the aggressive investigations we have launched of alleged abuses in GSA operations and CETA jobs programs.
I commend Representatives Fountain and Brooks, and Senators Eagleton and Ribicoff for their dedicated work in the development and refinement of this bill.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510]
