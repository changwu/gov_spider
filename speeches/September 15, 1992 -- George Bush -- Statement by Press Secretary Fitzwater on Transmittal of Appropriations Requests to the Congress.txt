    The President today announced his intention to transmit to the Congress budget amendments for the Department of Defense that would reallocate $250 million of the Department's FY 1993 request to Defense advanced-technology programs. The reallocated funds would be used in the areas of communications, high performance computers, small satellites, sensors to identify environmental contamination, and manufacturing technology. These areas are essential to national security and also have dual-use civilian applications. The funds for these advanced-technology programs would be reallocated from lower priority Defense programs.
Appropriations language was also requested to increase the United States FY 1993 contribution to the Asian Development Bank by $25.5 million. This additional contribution is necessary to maintain United States voting parity with Japan in the Bank. The increased FY 1993 budget authority for the contribution to the Bank would be fully offset by a reduction in the United States contribution to the Asian Development Fund.
The President also transmitted an FY 1992 supplemental appropriations request for the legislative branch. As required by law, appropriations requests for the legislative branch must be transmitted without change.
