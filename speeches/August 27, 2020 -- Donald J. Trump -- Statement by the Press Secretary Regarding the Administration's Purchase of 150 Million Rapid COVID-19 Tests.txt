    Today, the Trump Administration is pleased to announce the purchase and production of 150 million rapid tests to be distributed across the country. In March, President Donald J. Trump called for the development of a low cost, reliable point-of-care test. To deliver on this promise, the Administration has partnered with Abbott Laboratories to produce inexpensive and easy-to-use Abbott BinaxNOW tests. This is a major development that will help save more lives by further protecting America's most vulnerable and allow our country to remain open, get Americans back to work, and get kids back to school.
Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is leading the world in testing and the development of a wide range of reliable tests.
This announcement is made in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization for this new type of antigen test in which results can be read directly from the testing card. Made in America, for Americans, these new tests exemplify President Trump's whole-of-America approach, which harnesses industry and innovation to ensure America leads the world in combating COVID-19.
Through Operation Warp Speed and in partnership with Abbott Laboratories, final production will be scaled to an unprecedented 50 million tests monthly.
