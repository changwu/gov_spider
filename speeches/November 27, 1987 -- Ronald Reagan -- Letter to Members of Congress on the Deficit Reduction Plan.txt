    Dear (Member of Congress):
On November 20, the Leadership of the House and Senate joined with me to announce to the American people a bipartisan agreement to bring about meaningful reductions in the Federal deficit and maintain confidence in our Nation's economy. The agreement reflects a bipartisan commitment to reduce the deficit substantially over the next two years. It maintains vital government services, upholds our national security, and preserves the integrity and fairness embodied in last year's tax reform legislation.
In an agreement of this magnitude that results from tough bargaining, it is not difficult to find something with which to disagree. Nevertheless, the agreement is our best hope for achieving deficit reduction without resorting to indiscriminate across-the-board cuts that would devastate essential services.
I pledge to continue working with the Congress to complete this vital task begun by our negotiating teams. We must join together in a bipartisan way to preserve our economic gains and keep our Nation strong. Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
