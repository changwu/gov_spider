    Strengthening Medicare is one of our nation's top priorities. Today, a roadmap for tripartisan Medicare legislation was released by Senators Grassley, Snowe, Breaux, Jeffords, and Hatch. This roadmap is an encouraging step toward action in the Senate Finance Committee on achieving our shared goal of improving Medicare's coverage. The President remains committed to working with this tripartisan group, Chairman Baucus, and other members of Congress to bring better Medicare coverage, including a prescription drug benefit, to seniors while strengthening Medicare's long-term financial security.
