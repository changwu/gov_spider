    ARLINGTON, VA -- McCain-Palin 2008 today announced that more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors are endorsing Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin for president and vice president.
Prominent former U.S. ambassadors endorsing the McCain-Palin ticket include former Ambassador to Japan, Senate Majority Leader and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker; President George H. W. Bush, former Ambassador to the United Nations; former Ambassador to Yugoslavia and former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger; former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton; former Secretary of Defense and former Ambassador to Portugal, Frank Carlucci III; former Ambassador to the Vatican and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson; and Ambassadors Richard Burt (Germany), Bruce Gelb (Belgium), Margaret Heckler (Ireland), John L. Loeb (Denmark), Ed Ney (Canada) and Julia Chang Bloch (Nepal), the first U .S. ambassador of Asian descent.
Democrat Mark W. Erwin, a former Hillary Clinton supporter and an ambassador during the Clinton administration, is co-chair of the group. "I will vote for John McCain because the differences between the two candidates are so vast and profound," he said.
"Senator Obama does not have sufficient leadership experience, nor has he been tested in difficult times," Erwin said in his endorsement.
Other co-chairmen of the group called "Former U.S. Ambassadors for McCain/Palin" are former U .S. Ambassador to Sweden Gregory J. Newell and former Ambassador Gilbert A. Robinson, both of whom served in the Reagan administration. Newell also served as an assistant to President Gerald Ford and as Assistant Secretary of State. Robinson was special adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz, Director of the Office of Public Diplomacy and Deputy Director of the United States Information Agency.
"Nobody could ask for a greater show of confidence," Sen. McCain commented. "These former ambassadors are outstanding men and women who have served their country in foreign lands with great distinction and devotion to the values we all hold dear. They have a deep knowledge of the challenges facing this country abroad as well as at home. I am honored by their endorsement."
Ambassador Robinson added, "The endorsements from this country's most experienced foreign affairs experts are still pouring in. This demonstrates the overwhelming admiration and respect they have for John McCain's leadership and the confidence they have in the historic McCain-Palin ticket."
