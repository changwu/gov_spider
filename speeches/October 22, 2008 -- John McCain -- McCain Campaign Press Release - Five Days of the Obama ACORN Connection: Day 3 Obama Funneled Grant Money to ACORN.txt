Barack Obama Served On Boards That Funneled Money To ACORN. "Mr. Obama further expanded his list of allies by joining the boards of two well-known charities: the Woods Fund and the Joyce Foundation. These memberships have allowed him to help direct tens of millions of dollars in grants over the years to groups that championed the environment, campaign finance reform, gun control and other causes supported by the liberal network he was cultivating. Mr. Brazier's group, the Woodlawn Organization, received money, for instance, as did antipoverty groups with ties to organized labor like Chicago Acorn, whose endorsement Mr. Obama sought and won in his State Senate race." (Jo Becker and Christopher Drew, "Pragmatic Politics, Forged on the South Side," The New York Times, 5/11/08) 
"The Leftist Woods Fund, A Major ACORN Fertilizer." "One outgrowth of Obama's "community organizer" days in the not-so-leafy urbs of Chicago was serving on the board for the leftist Woods Fund, a major ACORN fertilizer. ACORN is ripe for a pruning, and Obama may have barked up the wrong tree with this group." ("Leaf Mold: Obama's ACORN Tie Points To Seedy Past," The Oklahoman, 10/15/08)
