    President Biden and Vice President Harris took office promising to move quickly to deliver results for working families – and that's what they've done in their first year. The President and Vice President made history growing our economy, getting Americans vaccinated, addressing the climate crisis, building a judiciary and government that represents America, and much more. Despite unprecedented challenges, thanks to their leadership, 2021 was a year of record progress for working families.
Today, members of Congress, the Senate, state and local elected leaders, and other prominent voices applauded the administration's accomplishments thus far.
See below for what they're saying:
Members of Congress
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi: "When President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in one year ago, our nation faced a dark and difficult moment from pandemic and economic crises. One year later, we proudly mark one of the most impactful first years of a presidency in modern times: getting shots into millions of arms, putting money in pockets and delivering the best year of job creation in American history. Together, President Biden and the Democratic Congress have worked relentlessly over the last year to improve countless lives across the country. Fueled by our American Rescue Plan and the President's strong actions on the economy, Democrats have powered an historic economic recovery that has created a record 6.4 million new jobs, slashed the unemployment rate with the biggest single-year drop ever, from 6.2 percent to 3.9 percent, and helping sixteen million Americans off the unemployment rolls. Our Rescue package also kickstarted a never-before-seen vaccination campaign that has gotten shots into the arms of 200 million Americans. With our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as we rebuild our infrastructure, we are transforming our middle class: repairing roads and bridges, improving public transit, securing clean water and broadband and much more, in communities across the country. The Congress also applauds President Biden's strong leadership on health care, expanding coverage to nearly five million more Americans and making health care under the ACA more affordable than ever before. One year into President Biden's term, our Democratic Majorities in Congress remain hard at work alongside the Administration to execute his spectacular vision for the future by continuing to support strong communities, lowering costs for American families, tackling the climate crisis and requiring the wealthiest to pay their fair share. We remain committed to delivering on this agenda – now and for decades to come." [Statement, 1/20/22]
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer: "One year ago, President Biden and Vice President Harris took office amid a deadly pandemic and economic crisis that were out of control. Today, most Americans are vaccinated against severe COVID-19, and we've experienced the greatest single year of job growth and economic recovery in our history. More than 6.4 million new jobs were created over the past year, bringing our unemployment rate down from 6.4% to just 3.9% - what economists consider full employment and far lower than experts had predicted. Meanwhile, we've seen real GDP grow faster than any year since 1984. The Dow Jones and NASDAQ indices have delivered double-digit returns for investors, and small-business applications have jumped nearly a third since before the pandemic. Nobody can deny that our economy is recovering steadily and strongly under this Administration. So far under this President and the Democratic-controlled Congress, we saw the enactment of the American Rescue Plan in President Biden's first three months in office -- delivering shots in arms, money in pockets, people in jobs, and tools to safely reopen schools. In the same year, the Biden-Harris Administration also championed transformational, bipartisan investments in infrastructure. The American Rescue Plan will be remembered as one of the most important pieces of legislation of our time, much like core components of the New Deal after President Roosevelt took office, halting the sharp decline in health safety and economic activity under the previous Republican-led government and offering a path back toward normalcy and growth. While the Omicron variant poses new challenges, nearly two out of three Americans are fully vaccinated today, and the vaccines and booster shots have been proven to save lives and improve health outcomes. The Biden-Harris Administration is also providing free testing and masks to meet this challenge and working to keep schools and businesses open safely. As a result of the long-overdue and long-demanded Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we've started the process of building back better by funding growth-oriented projects in transit, broadband, and clean energy. The previous occupant of the White House promised to get these things done but could not deliver. Moreover, he threatened our allies, cozied up to America's adversaries, and left office just days after inciting a riot to overturn our election that saw law enforcement maimed and killed on the grounds of our Capitol. This past year, President Biden has worked tirelessly to rebuild and strengthen our alliances, uphold the rule of law and our Constitution, and make clear to the enemies of democracy at home and abroad that our American ideals will endure. I congratulate President Biden and Vice President Harris on a successful first year in office and look forward to continuing our work together to keep building back better and providing Americans with responsible government For the People." [Statement, 1/20/22]

Political Groups
Building Back Together: One year ago today, President Joe Biden was sworn into office and delivered his inaugural address, outlining the challenges ahead for the country, and what he would do to take them on. The President noted that "few periods in our nation's history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we're in now," saying "millions of jobs have been lost," and "hundreds of thousands of businesses closed."
The President didn't only outline the challenges, he spoke about what he would do to take them on – that with unity, Americans can do great things:"With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus. We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice. We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world."
One year later, the Biden-Harris Administration has made tremendous strides, including fueling a historic economic recovery, implementing an unprecedented vaccine program, getting Americans back to work, and passing major pieces of economic legislation, including the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He also hasn't taken his foot off the gas, continuing to work to drive down prices, fight the pandemic, and finish the job to pass the Build Back Better Act.
President Biden promised to deliver for Americans, and is making enormous progress only one year into his first term. And he's not stopping there, because he knows there's more to do to put working and middle class families first. [Statement 1/20/22]

The American Rescue Plan put checks in people's pockets, lifted millions of children out of poverty and paved the way for the nation's fastest economic growth in decades.

'We at the Human Rights Campaign want to thank President Biden and Vice President Harris for their principled and committed policies in support of LGBTQ+ rights," said HRC Interim President Joni Madison. "For a community that is all too often under attack from a variety of regressive, self-serving actors, having strong LGBTQ+ allies in the White House has been a comfort to the community. From rolling back discriminatory policies and providing affirmative non-discrimination protections, to appointing LGBTQ+ people to prominent positions, to continuing to share the message of the importance of LGBTQ+ inclusion and equality, this administration has been as consistent in advancing the cause of progress as any we have seen. There's still a lot more to be done, and we at HRC look forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration and partners in Congress to ensure that essential reforms – including the LGBTQ+ protections in the Equality Act and the voting rights safeguards currently before the Senate – become the law of the land.'"

"But as the president said: there is still work to do. Congress must finish the job and pass the Build Back Better Act, which 65 percent of voters support.

Lisa Frank, Executive Director, Environment America: When President Biden took office last January, there was a tremendous sense of relief and hope from an environmental community that had been playing mostly defense at the federal level the past four years. This report shows those feelings were justified. Americans count on the federal government to safeguard the air we breathe, the water we drink and the public lands we enjoy, and on these fronts the Biden administration has made encouraging progress." [Statement, 1/20/22]
Business Leaders
Liz Fairchild, Executive Director, Business Forward: "President Biden set the tone early when he took decisive Executive Actions on day one, including revoking the Muslim travel ban and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. More than 1,000 small business leaders from our network signed a statement in support of the President's actions — and that was just the start. In the Administration's first month, Congress passed a $1.9 trillion recovery package, the American Rescue Plan with the support of corporate America. This past summer, the President brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass the biggest investment in the nation's public works in a generation, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Business supports these critical long term investments in American transportation, broadband, and the electric grid. The Administration has also successfully rolled out major COVID-19 vaccines at home and abroad, offering protection for more than 200 million Americans and sending another 400 million doses to developing countries. More than 95% of schools are open and the economy grew faster this past year than it has in decades, adding a record 6.4 million jobs. The business community supports the successes of the past year and decisive actions that create jobs, bolster local economies, and strengthen our communities." [Statement, 1/20/22]

Labor Unions:
Robert Martinez, President, IAM: The Machinists Union is giving high marks for the Biden-Harris administration's one-year anniversary in office, which has included the passage of pro-worker, pro-democracy legislation that supports and grows the labor movement.
"The Biden-Harris administration's policies are good for working families, including IAM members who have benefited from the actions of this administration," said IAM International President Robert Martinez Jr. "When I met with the administration at the beginning of their term, I advocated for investment in infrastructure that will benefit American workers and communities. President Biden kept his promise to strengthen Buy American laws and support extending much-needed economic relief to all workers, including our members in the airlines, manufacturing and transportation industries. The IAM looks forward to continuing to work with the Biden-Harris administration to move the pro-worker, pro-democracy agenda." [Statement, 01/20/22]
Chris Shelton, President, CWA: During his campaign, Joe Biden pledged to be the most pro-worker president in our country's history and he has spent the last 365 days delivering on that promise. On his very first day in office, President Biden fired Peter Robb, Donald Trump's union-busting National Labor Relations Board general counsel, making it clear that he stood on the side of workers, not corporations. He nominated Jennifer Abruzzo, a brilliant former CWA attorney who understands how the actions of the NLRB impact the daily lives of people at their workplaces. With Abruzzo as general counsel and the addition of Gwynne Wilcox and David Prouty to the NLRB, the Board has a pro-worker majority and is once again fulfilling its mission to protect the right of workers to join together to improve their wages and working conditions. He appointed a union member - Marty Walsh - as Secretary of Labor, and used his executive power to strengthen Buy America requirements for federal spending, provide protections, job security, and a minimum wage increase for federal contractors, ban non-compete agreements that limit job opportunities, and ensure that jobs and wages are taken into account during banking mergers. Throughout the Biden administration, union leaders and activists are being invited to share information and expertise to help shape policies that affect working people. President Biden established a Task force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, led by Vice President Kamala Harris. He has used his bully pulpit to encourage workers to join unions and to demand that companies stop bringing in scabs when workers go on strike. President Biden has had two monumental legislative victories in his first year: the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The American Rescue Plan provided critical funding to keep workers safe, protect jobs, and stabilize the pensions we've earned. It extended the successful payroll support program, directing money toward saving thousands of airline jobs instead of sending it into the pockets of executives and shareholders. Funding from the bill is being used to provide premium pay for essential state and local government workers and to invest in broadband infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will transform our lives, finally addressing much needed repair and improvements to our roads, bridges, airports, and utilities. The bill supports the expansion and affordability of broadband and prioritizes broadband projects from employers who follow labor law. All of this investment means more jobs, not just during the buildout phase, but because the new infrastructure will create new opportunities. While President Biden has laid a strong foundation, much remains to be done. The COVID pandemic has disrupted our lives, and over a million women have left the workforce, many because of a lack of affordable childcare options. Workers are organizing for better pay and working conditions, but weak and outdated labor laws make it much too difficult for them to build power by joining unions. With each passing day the potential impact of climate change grows more severe. President Biden's worker-centered Build Back Better plan would address these problems, but it remains mired in the U.S. Senate, trapped by arcane rules and procedures, including the filibuster, that allow a small number of Senators to block policies supported by large majorities of Americans. As we enter the second year of the Biden presidency, we must use our voices and our votes to build on the progress that we have made and empower working people to make lasting change by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. [Statement, 01/20/22]
Mary Kay Henry, President, SEIU: "A year into the Biden-Harris presidency, we've seen enormous accomplishments—shots in arms, checks in pockets, measures to empower working people and hold corporations accountable—and groundbreaking proposals to invest in union jobs, the care economy, climate resilience and more, all because working people organized to demand bold change. Essential workers and Black, brown, Asian and immigrant voters turned out in record numbers in 2020 to elect leaders to the White House, Senate and House to take action to build an inclusive economy that works for working people, not just the wealthy and corporations. In his first year as president, Biden has made COVID vaccines widely available and delivered pandemic relief benefits to families in record time. One of his first actions in office was to reorganize the National Labor Relations Board, sending a message that he was not going to allow the government to be used to further corporate interests at the expense of workers' rights. He raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour, spurring more states and cities to take that crucial step for all working people. He backed game-changing investments in home care workers and people who need care. Along the way, he ensured that working families received monthly child care tax credits, so that parents and child care workers could continue to work their essential jobs. Biden's list of accomplishments would be even longer by now if he weren't up against an authoritarian faction that is bent not just on seeing him fail, but on burning down democracy itself. Rather than standing up for working people who are demanding to be respected, protected, and paid living wages, Republican leadership has given itself entirely over to extremists and corporate interests. There's more work to be done. We will continue to fight—to Build Back Better with historic investments in jobs, secure our most sacred rights as voters and win protections for immigrant workers and their families. We believe that Joe Biden's presidency is critical to the future we have been organizing for decades." [Statement, 01/20/22]
Transportation Workers Union: "Today Marks on year since @POTUS Joe Biden's inauguration. In his first year in office, he has done some fantastic things for transport workers. Here are a few: (a thread) The American Rescue Plan funded transit, school bus, rail, and airline worker support to keep everyone employed and healthy through the end of the pandemic. Bipartisan infrastructure bill delivered historic investments for transit and rail with a full suite of labor protections. Pro-worker majorities at the @NLRB and NMB are helping expand workers' access to labor rights. or the first time ever, @NHTSAgov put out data collection and oversight requirements for autonomous vehicle manufacturers to hold this technology accountable to our safety standards. @USDOT published new Innovation Principles that put workers at the center of the conversation for new technology in transportation. @USDOL strongly defended transit workers' rights to negotiate for good retirement benefits under section 13c – reversing a bad decision by the Trump administration. Updated @USDOL rules for federal contractors guarantee workers the first-right-of-refusal to new jobs when a federal contract changes companies. Instructed @USDOT to publish NPRM on 10-hour rest rule for flight attendants, reversing years of delay by the Trump administration." [Twitter thread, 1/20/22]
AFL-CIO'S Transportation Trades Department: Biden's First Year in Office was a Capstone Year of Legislative Victories for Transportation Labor Unions and Workers [Blog, 1/20/22]
Lonnie Stephenson, President, IBEW: "On the campaign trail and throughout his presidency, Joe Biden has promised to be the most pro-union, pro-worker president in history. As President Biden celebrates his first year in office, I can say with confidence his actions are matching his words. "During his first year in office, President Biden took significant and historic steps to promote, protect, and enhance the rights of working people, including IBEW members. He appointed a union member to lead the Department of Labor. He created the first-ever White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. He ordered the federal government to spend taxpayer dollars on American goods made by American workers, and he signed dozens of executive orders that promote worker-friendly policies, including those that create good jobs in the energy sector. Among other significant achievements, President Biden signed into law the historic $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided working families the financial support they needed to make it through the pandemic. Included in this legislation is the Butch Lewis Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act, which saved pensions for millions, ensuring that those who work for a living will retire with the dignity they were promised. And he signed into law the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the single largest investment in infrastructure in American history. This once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure will put millions to work in good, union jobs modernizing the electric grid, repairing and expanding the vital transportation services Americans rely on, and creating the reduced-carbon energy solutions that will power our economy well into the 21st century and beyond. On behalf of the IBEW's 775,000 active and retired members, I applaud President Biden on these achievements and thank him for prioritizing the needs of working families." [Statement, 01/20/22]

Lee Saunders, President, AFSCME: "The Biden-Harris administration made a promise to fight for working people. And bar none, this is the most pro-union White House in generations. The president and the vice president share working people's values and have governed accordingly, sticking their necks out to advance our rights and freedoms. They understand what keeps Americans up at night. They have expressed solidarity with workers trying to form unions. They have been outspoken and unapologetic in their support for collective bargaining to win better pay and benefits for all, not just the people at the top. The American Rescue Plan, signed by President Biden just seven weeks into his term, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in public services, saving jobs and keeping our everyday heroes on the front lines. That's on top of direct checks to working families, education funding to reopen schools safely, enhanced unemployment benefits and a whole lot more. A few months ago, President Biden signed an infrastructure bill that will create union jobs and revitalize our communities by upgrading everything from roads and public transit to water systems and broadband. There is plenty of unfinished business. It remains critical that we expand voting rights and protect the integrity of our democracy. We have joined the president in that struggle and will continue doing everything possible to ensure fair elections that give every citizen a voice. The administration, together with its allies, must now focus its energies on passing key components of the Build Back Better Agenda, transforming millions of lives by lowering prescription drug costs and making child care more affordable, among many other things. And we still need labor law reform, making it easier for workers to organize and claim their seat at the table. We have seen major accomplishments on behalf of working people during the first year of the Biden-Harris administration. Now, we must continue the fight for greater progress in the years to come."

Former Leaders
Barack Obama: "In his inaugural address one year ago today, @POTUS committed to 'press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.' In the year since, he and the @VP have made significant progress in the face of enormous challenges. For eight years, I witnessed firsthand the empathy and precision @POTUS brought to our work repairing the American economy. And one year into his presidency, President Biden's administration has led a historic recovery effort. Under his leadership, our economy set the record for the most jobs added in a single year. Over 200 million people are now vaccinated against COVID-19. The American Rescue Plan provided relief to families. More people can now afford healthcare. This Administration has also recommitted to the fight against climate change, and signed a crucial infrastructure law to improve roads and buildings across our country. And they're only getting started. The road ahead will not be easy, especially when one of our two major parties is standing in the way. But I still believe we can create a brighter future together, and I look forward to watching the Biden Administration build on this progress." [Twitter thread, 1/20/22]
