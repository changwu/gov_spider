    On this historic day 30 years ago, representatives of the United States and Japan exchanged instruments of ratification and put into effect the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, an agreement which is the very foundation of the overall relationship between our two countries and provides the framework for peace and stability in Asia.
The past three decades have witnessed remarkable progress and prosperity among the free nations of the Pacific region. Such progress would not have been possible but for the framework for peace and stability that the Treaty has provided. As we consider the important role that the Treaty has played over these years, our respect deepens for the wise judgment made by our predecessors.
With our combined economic strength, our steadfast security relationship, and our common adherence to political and economic freedom, the United States and Japan, working together, constitute a force for positive change in the world.
We are partners for peace, and the foundation of our partnership is the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. In the coming decades, as we pursue our global partnership, the Treaty will remain a vital instrument for ensuring the freedom and security of our two nations and promoting peace and prosperity throughout the world. On this occasion, therefore, we hereby renew our commitment and efforts steadfastly to maintain and effectively implement the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security.
