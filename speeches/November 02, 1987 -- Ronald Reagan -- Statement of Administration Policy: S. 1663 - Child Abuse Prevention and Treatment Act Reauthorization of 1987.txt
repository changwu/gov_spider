    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Dodd (D) Connecticut and 16 others)
The administration supports extension of child abuse prevention and treatment programs and adoption opportunities programs. The Senate child abuse reauthorization bill, S. 1663, represents some improvement over the House-passed bill, H.R. 1900, since it does not contain that bill's burdensome administrative provisions. However, S. 1663 does contain other objectionable provisions. Accordingly, the administration could support S. 1663 if it were amended to:

 reduce the authorization levels for fiscal years 1988-91 from $370 million to the $124 million assumed in the President's 1988 budget for that period;  
 remove the proposed new National Commission on Child and Youth Deaths. There is no need for statutory establishment of such a commission;  
 eliminate the unnecessary reauthorization of the family violence prevention program, because the services under that program can be carried out under other authorities, such as the Social Services Block Grant; and  
 repeal the authority for child abuse prevention challenge grants. These grants have achieved their purpose since most States have now established trust funds for these activities.
