(House Rules)
(Representative Guthrie, R-Kentucky, and 17 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 4984, Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, which strengthens financial counseling requirements for students receiving federal student aid. This legislation would help students get the information they need to make responsible decisions about how to pay for higher education.
While the bill offers a modest step in the right direction, it does not provide any new resources for these purposes. This legislation is not a substitute for much needed and more comprehensive action to tackle the rising cost of a college education. The Administration urges the Congress to do more to ensure that college is affordable for American families. This is particularly important today, when a college education is critical to ensuring that our workforce has the skills needed to meet the demands of the Nation's growing economy. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to improve this legislation.
