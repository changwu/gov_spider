    I offer congratulations to Jonathan Greenblatt, who will succeed Abe Foxman as the next National Director of the Anti-Defamation League. As Director of the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation at the White House, Jonathan has been a valued member of my team and worked tirelessly to support innovative solutions to America's challenges. I can't thank him enough for his service.
For more than a century, the Anti-Defamation League has been a strong moral voice against anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms. I am confident that Jonathan will build on Abe's extraordinary legacy, ensuring that the Anti-Defamation League remains at the forefront of efforts to achieve greater justice, freedom, and equality for people in the United States and across the globe.
