    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Bass, D-CA, and 36 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 6878, the Pregnant Women in Custody Act. Meeting the needs of pregnant women in custody will help improve their outcomes upon release as well as those of their children, families, and communities. This legislation would build on steps the Administration is taking—including under President Biden's Executive Order on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety—to enhance the accessibility and quality of medical care for all incarcerated persons, with a focus on supporting women's health.
This bipartisan legislation would require the Bureau of Prisons to provide incarcerated women with pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection testing; contraception; appropriate housing, bedding, clothing, access to hydration and restrooms, prenatal vitamins, and other appropriate conditions of confinement; screening and care for high-risk pregnancy, substance use, and mental health conditions, including postpartum depression; and prenatal education, counseling, and information about birth support services.
In addition, H.R. 6878 would require limitations on the use of restrictive housing and solitary confinement for pregnant women. H.R. 6878 would also require the Justice Department to develop guidelines and training on the health needs of pregnant women and provide technical assistance to state and local correctional facilities.
H.R. 6878 would also require increased data collection on the services provided to incarcerated pregnant women in Federal, State, Tribal, and local facilities.
This legislation would strengthen the efforts of prisons and jails to meet the needs of pregnant and postpartum women in custody, which will advance maternal health and improve life outcomes for them and their children.
