    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, U.S. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado endorsed Ted Cruz for President. Senator Gardner was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 2005 and as Minority Whip in 2006. He was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 and now serves in the United States Senate.
"Ted Cruz has always been a fierce defender of the Constitution and a tireless advocate for conservative principles," said Senator Gardner. "He has spent his entire career fighting for the men and women of this country and pushing back against the special interests in Washington. Ted is the only candidate who will change the way Washington works and restore the balance of power back to the American people. It's time for Republicans to rally behind this campaign in order to put forth the best candidate to stop Hillary Clinton in November. I am confident Ted Cruz is that person and I'm thrilled to endorse him for President."
"Cory has spent his time in Congress focused on improving the economy, creating jobs, and fighting for the people of Colorado," said Cruz. "He has stood up and been a strong advocate for conservative principles like stopping the train wreck that is Obamacare and this dangerous deal the Obama administration struck with Iran. I am honored to have Cory's support and look forward to working together to continue to coalesce Republicans around this campaign."
