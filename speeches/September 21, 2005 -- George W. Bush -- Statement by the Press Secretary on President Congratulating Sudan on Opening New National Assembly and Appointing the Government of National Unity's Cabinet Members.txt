    Today, the President congratulated the leaders and people of the Republic of Sudan on the opening of their new National Assembly on August 31 and the appointment of the Government of National Unity's cabinet members on September 20.
These are important milestones in the continuing implementation of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed at the beginning of this year. All Sudanese can be proud of this significant progress, because it demonstrates the parties' continued commitment to a common vision of a unified, democratic, prosperous, and peaceful Sudan.
The United States remains firmly committed to the cause of peace in all of Sudan. We call on Sudan's National Assembly and its newly appointed leaders to maintain the momentum toward peace throughout the country, recognizing it as an inclusive process that encompasses the south, the east, and Darfur. Sudan must take those steps necessary to stop all forms of violence in Darfur, support humanitarian and African Union operations, and achieve a political settlement for Darfur through the peace talks in Abuja. Only then can Sudan truly begin to realize its great human and economic potential and demonstrate to its people and the international community that it is genuinely committed to charting a new course.
