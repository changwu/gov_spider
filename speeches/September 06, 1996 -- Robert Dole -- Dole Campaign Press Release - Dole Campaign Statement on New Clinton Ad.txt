    Dole for President Press Secretary Nelson Warfield released the following statement today on the new Clinton/Gore attack ad:
"This new Clinton ad crosses the line from inaccurate to offensive. Bill Clinton, the same man who broke his promise of a middle-class tax cut and forced through the largest tax hike in history, has the gall to accuse Bob Dole of raising taxes and cutting Medicare, Bill Clinton, who raised taxes on millions of Social Security recipients, is attacking Bob Dole, the man who saved our Social Security system from bankruptcy. Bill Clinton, who has proposed 255 tax increases in his first three and half years in office, has the nerve to impugn the fiscal responsibility of Bob Dole, who cut taxes by a net $ 1.9 trillion since 1981.
"Bill Clinton has already set one world record for the largest tax hike in history; now he's set a new record for the most shameless ad of this political season."
