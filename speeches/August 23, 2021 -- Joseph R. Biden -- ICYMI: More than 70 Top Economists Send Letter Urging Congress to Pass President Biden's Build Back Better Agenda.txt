    Today, more than 70 top economists signed a letter to Congress calling for passage of the Build Back Better agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which they argue "will create millions of jobs, lower costs for American families, and lead to significant economic growth."
In the letter, led by former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Austan Goolsbee, the economists write: "Some analyses suggest that together, these two packages could, on average, add nearly 2 million jobs per year over the course of the decade, while accelerating America's path to full employment and increasing labor force participation through expanded access to early childhood programs that allow more parents to return to work.
"In addition, the plans will reduce prescription drug costs and lower taxes for nearly 90% of families with children in the U.S. by expanding the Child Tax Credit.
Finally, they will increase GDP and deliver much-needed long term growth for the American economy."
