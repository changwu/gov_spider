Washington DC - The National Latino Coalition of Christian Ministers and Leaders (CONLAMIC) endorses JOE BIDEN for President of the United States.
CONLAMIC is an entity that includes over 15,000 Latino churches, and is NOT affiliated with any political party, with a trajectory of twenty (20) years, advocating for social justice and principles of FAITH in public policy discourse.
"Regardless of the differences that exist in issues of social theological consciousness, we have prayed and understood that the North American nation needs a change in domestic politics and the urgent need to heal wounds that divide North American society to the extreme. We also understand that at this time in the midst of the pandemic and great uncertainty, there is an enormous need for honest and transparent leadership. Former VP JOE BIDEN, is the best option for the country," declares Rev. Miguel A. Rivera, President of CONLAMIC.
CONLAMIC considers that the present political-ideological discourse adversely affects the dynamics of social thought causing serious divisions in the family and communities and this warrants a leadership of deep principles of DECENCY AND RESPECT, which the candidate JOE BIDEN exhibits. "The issues of Christian life and conduct are a priority for the pulpit.
