Wow! A federal Judge in the Southern District of N.Y. completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee against our historic 2016 campaign for President. The Judge said the DNC case was 'entirely divorced' from the facts yet another total & complete....Retweets: 33521Favorites: 138969

....vindication & exoneration from the Russian WikiLeaks and every other form of HOAX perpetrated by the DNC Radical Democrats and others. This is really big 'stuff' especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by President Clinton. The Witch Hunt Ends!Retweets: 26745Favorites: 119495

Such a great victory in court yesterday on the Russian Hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our Country. TREASON! Hopefully the Attorney Generel of the United States and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened. NEVER AGAIN!!!!Retweets: 26216Favorites: 105241

If I hadn't won the 2016 Election we would be in a Great Recession/Depression right now. The people I saw on stage last night & you can add in Sleepy Joe Harris & the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before.

CNN's Don Lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate 'question' that I was a racist when in fact I am 'the least racist person in the world.' Perhaps someone should explain to Don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased & fair.....Retweets: 36936Favorites: 188421

....or is he too dumb (stupid} to understand that. No wonder CNN's ratings (MSNBC's also) have gone down the tubes - and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom. Don't hold your breath!Retweets: 23858Favorites: 134466

What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China The European Union and other countries around the world....Retweets: 15380Favorites: 71716

....As usual Powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldn't have started in the first place - no inflation. We are winning anyway but I am certainly not getting much help from the Federal Reserve!Retweets: 14556Favorites: 67982
