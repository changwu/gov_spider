    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Jason Robards. An accomplished actor, Mr. Robards was a commanding presence on the big screen and a passionate force on the stage.
Jason Robards' numerous accomplishments represent the esteem in which his colleagues and his fans held him. After winning two Oscars and a Tony award, Hillary and I had the privilege of honoring Jason's long career both in 1997 with a National Medal of Arts and again in 1999 with the Kennedy Center Honors award for his lifetime of contribution to American arts and culture. Mr. Robards was also a hero in his pre-acting days. Surviving the attack on Pearl Harbor, he earned the Navy Crossâ€”the secondhighest naval decoration.
Mr. Robards will be missed by all of us who cherished him and his work. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Lois, and their six children.
