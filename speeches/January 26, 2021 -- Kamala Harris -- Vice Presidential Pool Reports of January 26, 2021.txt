VP pool report #1 — gathering for Yellen swearing-in ceremony
Good morning from the White House, where Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to swear in Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at 12:00pm.
The event will take place in the East Landing overlooking the Treasury building, per White House. VP is not expected to take any questions, but I'll pass along any relevant color/attendees as I spot them.

VP POOL #7 — stage is set for vaccine / event started
The room is pretty empty outside of press pool and secret service. The nurse is on the stage with a table, one chair presumably for the Vice President who just walked in.
Everyone is masked. And we were handed a clean mask to put on.
