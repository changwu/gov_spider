Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the President's remarks concerning an economic stimulus package:
"Today, the President took an important step forward to jumpstarting our economy by laying out his principles for an economic stimulus package. We must immediately cut taxes on both individuals and businesses, and address the housing crisis to help American homeowners. Permanent reductions in both individual and corporate tax rates are vital to strengthening the economy in the long term. Tomorrow, I will offer my ideas on how to most effectively grow this economy in the short term. It is critical for every American that Washington quickly debate, pass and sign into law a pro-growth stimulus package."
