    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246) (the "Act"), and as President of the United States, I hereby report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to terminate the suspensions under section 902 of the Act insofar as such suspensions pertain to the export of bomb containment and disposal units for use in the prevention of terrorist bombings.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
