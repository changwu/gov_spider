    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Customs Convention on the International Transit of Goods (ITI Convention) opened for signature at Vienna June 7, 1971.
For the information of the Senate, I am also transmitting the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Convention is designed to meet the present need to facilitate international transport while, at the same time, providing the customs control arrangements necessary for such transport. The Convention provides for new, uniform control and documentation procedures which carriers of Governments party to the Convention would be able to use at their option.
The Convention would help open the way for United States exporters and carriers to benefit in Western Europe and other markets of the world from the simplified and uniform procedures for which it provides.
I recommend that the Convention be given early and favorable consideration by the Senate.
