    The United States is deeply concerned about today's developments in Niger. We strongly condemn any effort to detain or subvert the functioning of Niger's democratically elected government, led by President Bazoum. We specifically urge elements of the presidential guard to release President Bazoum from detention and refrain from violence. We welcome the strong statements and steps taken by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union to defend Niger's democracy. We are closely monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of our citizens.
Niger is a critical partner for the United States. We have shared values on democracy and human rights, and collaborate to advance regional security and prosperity, and our substantial cooperation with the Government of Niger is predicated on Niger's continued commitment to democratic standards.
