    Two Kentucky leaders responded to Senator Obama's comments on small town America today, encouraging him to visit Kentucky to learn more about their communities.
BACKGROUND: At a fundraiser in San Francisco this week, Senator Obama shared his views of Americans from small towns: "...it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."
Former Kentucky Democratic Party chairman Jerry Lundergan said, "Senator Obama's remarks at a San Francisco fundraiser demonstrate he doesn't understand Kentucky families.
"When he campaigns here, Sen. Obama will learn that we have a strong commitment to faith, to family and to the freedoms of the Constitution. The families of Kentucky are proud, not bitter. They are hungry for leadership that respects them and understands their struggles, not leadership that puts them down for their beliefs.
"While Kentuckians are disheartened by the failed economic policies of the Bush administration, we are a resilient state that is optimistic about America's future.
"Kentucky's strength lies in our small communities. We are proud of the towns all across our 120 counties, full of people who look and sound nothing like those Senator Obama portrayed."
Former Attorney General, Majority Floor Leader, and current State Representative Greg Stumbo said, "I found Senator Barack Obama's comments incredibly unfortunate. After representing eastern Kentucky for 25 years, I can tell you what we don't need are stereotypes that discount our faith and our values. We need a President with a real plan that produces real results."
