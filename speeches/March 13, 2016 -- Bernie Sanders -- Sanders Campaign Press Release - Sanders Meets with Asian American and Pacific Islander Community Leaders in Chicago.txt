Bernie Sanders on Saturday met with prominent leaders of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to discuss the need for immigration reform, securing voting rights, and providing affordable healthcare to all Americans. Sanders was joined by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, and Brad Jenkins, former Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. There are more than 600,000 Asian Americans living in Illinois.
"I support Senator Sanders because of the historic number of young Americans who have joined the campaign — volunteering, donating and organizing their communities for change," said Jenkins. "If we hope to protect and build on the progress of President Obama, we need to continue to lift up these young voters and inspire them to the polls."
"Our communities have often been the difference between winning and losing. The margin of victory makes a difference," said Rep. Gabbard.
"In times where Islamophobia and xenophobia are running rampant, where Asian-Americans are victims of racial profiling, where black and brown people are targets of police brutality, Sanders stands up for the marginalized with his policies," said Kristina Wong.
