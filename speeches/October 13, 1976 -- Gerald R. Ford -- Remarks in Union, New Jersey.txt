    Thank you all very, very much. These wonderful bands, I thank each and every one of you. Thank you very much.
It's great to be in Union. I saw a sign on the way here, a sign that means a great deal to me. The sign said, "Jersey Likes Jerry." Let me respond by saying Jerry likes Jersey. You're great.
I like Jersey because I know good people like Cliff Case, like Bob Kean, who I had the honor of serving with for a number of years. I like the kind of people that you have joined with me in my campaign. And I am in New Jersey because New Jersey is a very important State.
I have heard rumors, I hear talk, I read some stuff that's written that the American people are apathetic, they're not going to vote, they don't care about this election. Let me say very strongly, I believe the American people do care. You care because there is a clear difference between Mr. Carter and myself. He wants to increase your taxes. I want to reduce and decrease your taxes.
Mr. Carter wants to increase Federal spending. I want to hold the lid on Federal spending. Mr. Carter wants to undercut our national defense. I think that's wrong. America has to stay number one, and we will under President Ford.
So, when you come right down to it, there is a choice. The American people are concerned, they do care. And I say again, Jerry Ford loves Jersey just like Jersey loves Jerry.
Thank you very much.
