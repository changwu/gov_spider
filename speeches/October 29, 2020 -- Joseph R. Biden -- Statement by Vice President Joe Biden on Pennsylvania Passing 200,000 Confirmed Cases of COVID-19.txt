    The news that Pennsylvania has passed the grim milestone of 200,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases is a tragic reminder that President Trump has failed at his most basic and essential duty, to keep American families safe. Rather than working to contain the spread of the virus, President Trump continues to peddle the lie that America is rounding the corner on this pandemic. President Trump's actions have cost thousands of lives and hundreds of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania.
The frontline workers fighting this virus and the thousands of families across the Commonwealth who will sit down to dinner tonight with an empty chair at their table deserve better. Working together, we can overcome this virus, help communities across the Commonwealth reopen safely, and get individuals back to work in good-paying union jobs. It has never been more clear that the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians is on the ballot in this election.
