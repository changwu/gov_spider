    The President. Well, let me just -- one, I'm sorry for keeping you waiting and, two, say what a great pleasure it is to receive Captain [Alfred] Haynes and the crew -- everybody connected with this tragedy, but also connected with what I would term as a national heroism. I know Al would disclaim all credit, but certainly he deserves an awful lot. And there's the controllers, and there's the ground crew, and there's the cabin crew, and then there's a lot of plain people that were just watching with wonder and great pride. So, I'm glad you all came.
What I want to do when we finish what looks like an ample photo opportunity here -- [laughter] -- invite you, if you would, to come into the Oval Office, and maybe we can have some individual pictures. But with our friends here, it gives me an opportunity to say thank you from a very grateful nation.
Captain Haynes. Thank you, sir.
The President. Can I talk you into coming across the hall? [Laughter]
