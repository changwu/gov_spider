This was sent to the in-town pool, but sharing with you all to send as well:
From a White House official:
From August 28 at 3:00 AM EDT to August 29 at 3:00 AM EDT, a total of approximately 2,900 people were evacuated from Kabul. This is the result of 32 U.S. military flights (26 C-17s and 6 C-130s), which carried approximately 2,200 evacuees, and 9 coalition flights, which carried 700 people.
Since August 14, the U.S. has evacuated and facilitated the evacuation of approximately 114,400 people. Since the end of July, we have relocated approximately 120,000 people. 


August 29, 202109:41

Travel pool report #6: Holding and briefing
Pool is holding in the air force base terminal for the dignified transfer. In the meantime we have been briefed on ground rules and what to expect.
No one will be allowed to have their phones with them. This means Pool will be unable to send pool reports as it happens. We will endeavour to give you a heads up so that you know it's coming, but we will only be able to send details after the event has concluded.
Officials are precise in their language. They refer to a 'dignified transfer' which is not a 'ceremony' but is instead a 'solemn movement.' They use this language so that family members do not feel obliged to attend.
'Fallen service members' return in a flag-draped 'transfer case,' rather than a cask or coffin. 


August 29, 202110:12

Travel pool report #7: Radio silence 
Pool is moving to the transfer site. Once there we will have no phone access until after the event. There is no streaming or transmission of images until after the event.
These are the rules of the Air Force officials handling the transfer.
So this will be the last pool report until after the dignified transfer has concluded when we will send as much detail and color as possible. 


August 29, 202110:13

Travel pool report #8: POTUS meeting 
From White House:
The President and the First Lady are meeting with the families of fallen American service members in the Center for Families of the Fallen. 


August 29, 202112:34

Travel pool report #9: Dignified transfer 1 
The transfer began at 11:18 with a cry of 'Wheels rolling, wheels rolling,' denoting that the bus carrying families was on its way.
It finished at about 12:07 when four transfer vehicles drove away, after 11 transfer cases had been removed from a C-17 Globemaster II and carried to the vans.
Two further transfers were to be conducted once Pool was removed as the families had requested privacy.
POTUS and FLOTUS arrived with Secy Austen and other dignitaries taking part in the transfers. Their party of eight walked up the ramp into the C-17 for a minute's prayer. They then emerged to take up position opposite pool as the transfers began.
POTUS clasped his right hand to his chest when the order to 'present arms' came with each transfer case, while military officers salutes. His eyes were locked on the cases as they were carried to the transfer vehicles, occasionally bowing his head and appearing to close his eyes.
More to follow.
From the White House:

Travel pool report #10: Dignified transfer 2
The fallen service members arrived from Ramstein Air Base at 8am on Sunday, according to Christin Michaud, chief of public affairs for Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations. Their journey took them from Kabul, to Kuwait, then to Germany and Dover.
The weather was overcast - a slight spot of rain before the proceedings began - and about 77F.
Pool was lined up by the base of the ramp of the C-17. To our right, screened by vehicles, was an area for family members. Pool was instructed not to look, film or photograph in that direction. At certain points during the transfer, the sound of anguished sobbing could be heard from that area - during the transfer of the second case and after the end of the transfer
Directly across from Pool were the people viewing or taking part in the transfers, they were arranged into 10 ranks of 3, or 4 in parts.
Four transfer vehicles were lined up to our right, about 30 yards from the base of the C-17 ramp.
11:04 POTUS motorcade arrived. POTUS, FLOTUS and Secretary Austin could be seen talking to members of one of the transfer teams (the squads of service members Army, Marines, Navy, carrying the transfer cases from C-17 to transfer vehicles)
Everyone present was masked.
The family bus pulled up at about 11:20 after a cry of 'Family in sight, family in sight.' A marshal in fatigues with white gloves use orange batons to guide it in.
Proceedings got under way when the first seven-strong transfer party - the Army Old Guard - marched slowly towards the C-17. Behind them came an eight-strong party including Austin, Milley, Berger, McConville, Gilday, and Hollinger - FLOTUS and POTUS brought up the rear, emerging from behind the transfer vehicles.
POTUS was the last person to walk slowly up the ramp. They emerged a minute or so later with POTUS again at the rear - we were told there had been a prayer inside - to take up the positions with the other viewers. POTUS was on the far left - with FLOTUS next to him, then Austin and Milley.
At a command of 'present arms' the officers all saluted while civilians - including POTUS and FLOTUS - put their right hands to their chests.
The Army transfer team carried out a flag-draped transfer case, walking slowly - heel to toe - to the transfer vehicle. POTUS kept his eyes locked on the case until it was secure on the transfer vehicle.
The Army team then moved off to the side, replaced by a pair of Marine teams who had nine cases to remove. The Navy brought out the final transfer case. Each of the teams wore their battle dress uniform and white gloves.
As each case passed by, Biden followed its progress turning his head to watch it reach the transfer vehicles. He bowed his head after most of them as if to say a prayer.
There was barely a sound made by anyone present, except for the orders barked by a marshal, the 'hup, hup' of the transfer teams quietly keeping time. It would have been silent were it not for the gentle thrum of aircraft machinery.
It was a sticky, overcast day. And the weather appeared to take its toll on a woman standing a couple of rows behind FLOTUS. Just as the 11th case was about to emerge she appeared to faint and had to be carried away for treatment, but it made no impact on the transfer as the Navy transfer team emerged from the C-17.
After the transfer concluded, FLOTUS made her way to an ambulance as if to check on the condition of the woman.
POTUS and FLOTUS climbed into their black Suburban at about 12-15.
Some other details, background and language guidance - some of which was sent earlier.
Since 2009, when the media policy changed, more than 2000 fallen service members have passed through Dover, in transfers attended by 10,000 family members.
President Obama attended twice - 2009, 2011
President Trump four times
This is President Biden's first visit

Travel pool report #11: AF1 
POTUS motorcade pulled up to AF1 at 13:20
POTUS emerged and saluted a military officer. He then walked away from the plane to talk to ranks of service personnel in battle dress uniform and white gloves.
These are the men who were in the transfer teams during the dignified transfer. He handed out challenge coins by placing them in his palm and then shaking hands.
He and FLOTUS then said goodbye to their hosts at the air force base before climbing the steps.
He waved and saluted at the top. 13:27
Wheels up imminently.

Travel pool report #17: FEMA remarks
POTUS entered the open plan National Response Coordination Center - with banks of screens and computers - at 15:20.
He spoke briefly to a handful of members of staff who erupted with laughter, before making his way to the lectern to be introduced by FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell.
He spoke about Afghanistan off the top.
'You've got your hands full, but you've done an incredible job so far in prep for this job.
Jill and I are just getting back from Dover Air Force Base in my home state, where we met with the families of 13 fallen heroes in Afghanistan... 'lost their lives in service to our country,'
While preparing for Ida, he asked everyone present to keep them in their prayers.
As ever check quotes - we are on move immediately.
