    "It comes as no surprise that Planned Parenthood would endorse Joe Biden – a 50-year, Washington elitist who is controlled by the radical ideas of the Democrat Party. In an effort to conform to the far Left's agenda, Biden is now calling for zero restrictions on abortion and wants to force taxpayers to foot the bill. Biden has also made promises to 'codify Roe v. Wade,' taking the issue out of the hands of our duly appointed Supreme Court justices. In sharp contrast, President Trump is the most pro-life President in history and has safeguarded the rights of the unborn – not only in America but abroad. Planned Parenthood's endorsement only further solidifies Joe Biden's cowardly submission to the radical DNC and his extreme position on abortion."
