    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 3, 2019) â€” Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer authorized $2.7 million in funding to Need to Impeach (NTI) to support the over 8.3 million Americans working to hold Donald Trump accountable for his crimes.
"With impeachment reaching an inflection point in Congress, paired with the American people's overwhelming call to act on Trump's crimes and corruption, I have decided it's necessary to provide Need to Impeach with the resources this movement needs," said Steyer. "While I have resigned from NTI and I am no longer involved with the organization, it is important to financially support the incredible work this grassroots organization has done to galvanize the American people to remove this lawless and corrupt president from office."
The announcement of Steyer's additional funding comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced last week that the House of Representatives will begin a formal impeachment inquiry.
