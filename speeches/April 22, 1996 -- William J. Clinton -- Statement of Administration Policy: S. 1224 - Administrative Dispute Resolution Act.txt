(Senate)(Grassley (R) Iowa and 2 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1224, which would permanently reauthorize the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act and improve several of the Act's provisions. One of S. 1224's most important provisions is a carefully crafted exemption to the Freedom of Information Act. This exemption would-give alternative dispute resolution (ADR) a greater chance of success by allowing ADR communications to be confidential.
