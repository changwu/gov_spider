    Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies:
The 11th Annual Report on Federal Executive Boards reflects a solid record of accomplishment. Clearly, these boards offer a useful means of focusing the energies and talents of senior Federal executives across the Nation on areas of special concern.
As we move toward a more decentralization of the Federal establishment, the responsibility of Federal officials in the field will increase. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that these Boards are equipped to respond quickly to Federal initiatives and that they enjoy a high degree of cooperation across the traditional lines of Federal authority.
I would like you to call to the attention of all senior officials in the field the attached report on FEB activity and inform them of my strong personal endorsement of the FEB concept. I hope you will also express my appreciation to all of those whose efforts made fiscal year 1972 a successful one for Federal Executive Boards.
RICHARD NIXON
