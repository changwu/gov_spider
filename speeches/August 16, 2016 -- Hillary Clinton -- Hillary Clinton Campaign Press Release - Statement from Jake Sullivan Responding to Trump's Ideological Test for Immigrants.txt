    Hillary For America Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan released the following statement today in response to Donald Trump's call for submitting immigrants to ideological tests:
"This so-called 'policy' cannot be taken seriously. How can Trump put this forward with a straight face when he opposes marriage equality and selected as his running mate the man who signed an anti-LGBT law in Indiana? It's a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country and no one should fall for it."
HFA also released a new corresponding video.
