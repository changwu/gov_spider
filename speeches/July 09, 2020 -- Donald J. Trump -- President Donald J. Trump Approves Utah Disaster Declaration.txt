    Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that a major disaster exists in the State of Utah and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by an earthquake during the period of March 18 to April 17, 2020.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Davis and Salt Lake.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
Pete Gaynor, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kenneth G. Clark as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
