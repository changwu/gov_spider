    VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you all for taking time to meet with us. And I'm here to say, on behalf of the people of the United States of America: We are with you, and we will stay with you until your libertad is restored.
The American people are proud to work with Colombia to provide assistance to you and your families as you fled from the oppression and the deprivation that has fallen upon Venezuela.
The people of the United States will continue to support you and your families. But we will also stand strong with the only legitimate President of Venezuela, President Juan Guaidó.
So I encourage you to have faith. Have faith in this courageous family and all the leaders for freedom in Venezuela that they represent. Have faith that, under President Donald Trump's leadership, the United States of America and freedom-loving nations around the world will stand with you. And have faith that you will someday go home and that Venezuela will one day be free. I believe it with all of my heart. For where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
PARTICIPANTS: Amen. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: With that, it's my great honor to stand here with the Interim President of Venezuela, President Juan Guaidó.
INTERIM PRESIDENT GUAIDÓ: (Speaks Spanish.)
