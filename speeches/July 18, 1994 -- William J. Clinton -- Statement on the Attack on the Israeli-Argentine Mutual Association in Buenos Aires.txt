    The United States deeply regrets the loss of life caused by the cowardly attack Monday against the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association in Buenos Aires.
This terrible loss of innocent life must not deter civilized society from opposing the enemies of peace.
The United States will redouble its efforts on behalf of peace in the Middle East and elsewhere and offers its full assistance and cooperation in helping to identify and locate those responsible for this brutal act.
