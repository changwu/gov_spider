    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Hatch (R) Utah and 57 cosponsors)
The President is deeply committed to protection of the United States flag and will continue to condemn those who show it any form of disrespect. The Administration believes, however, that efforts to limit the First Amendment to make a narrow exception for flag desecration are misguided. The Congress should be deeply reluctant to tamper with the First Amendment.
