    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Mitchell (D) Maine and 32 others)
U.S. leadership in the humanitarian relief operations in Somalia has been the critical component of the international community's success in averting further tragedy in that war-torn country. Responsibility for the protection of humanitarian operations in Somalia has now been transferred from the U.S.-led Unified Task Force (UNITAF) to a United Nations peace-enforcement/peacekeeping operation, UNOSOM II. We welcome this transfer of responsibility to the United Nations and the broader international community.
The Administration takes great pride in the success of UNITAF and commends American troops for their performance during this humanitarian relief operation. We are confident that; under the leadership of the United Nations and with U.S. participation, UNOSOM II will accomplish its mission: assisting the Somali people in building functioning political institutions and a civil society, in addition to keeping the peace.
While we continue to believe that congressional authorization for the deployment of U.S. forces to Somalia is not necessary and would prefer that the Resolution not specify any time limit for U.S. activities in Somalia, the Administration welcomes Congressional support for U.S. activities in Somalia as expressed in S.J. Res. 45. We particularly welcome the Resolution's reference to United Nations Security Council Resolution 814 of March 26, 1993, which sets forth the U.N.'s mandate for UNOSOM II.
