    On behalf of the American people, President Bush congratulates Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on his victory in the Republic of Indonesia's presidential election. Indonesia's General Election Commission announced the results in the final round of balloting and declared Mr. Yudhoyono the winner on October 4. Indonesia held successful general elections in April and a first round of presidential balloting in July.
We commend the people of Indonesia on this latest achievement in their country's impressive transition to democracy. This was the first time Indonesians have had the opportunity to choose their leader through a direct presidential election. Over 116 million people, nearly 77 percent of eligible voters, participated peacefully in the final round of balloting on September 20. This was another resounding demonstration of the Indonesian people's commitment to democracy. The direct presidential election system is among several important reforms Indonesia has undertaken to strengthen its democracy since 1999.
The United States and Indonesia have long-standing bonds of friendship. We thank President Megawati Sukarnoputri for her leadership and service to her country during this historic period. We look forward to working with President-elect Yudhoyono in further strengthening our ties and enhancing the welfare of our peoples.
