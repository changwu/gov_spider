    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hughes (D) New Jersey and 11 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3911 but will continue to review the bill in the Senate to determine the extent to which, if any, proposed 18 U.S.C. 1031(e) (concerning reprisals by employers against individuals who assist in major fraud prosecutions) is objectionable.
