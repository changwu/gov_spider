    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
Subject: Interim Report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses
On May 26, 1995, I established the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to review and provide recommendations on the full range of government activities relating to Gulf War veterans' illnesses. The Committee has now released its interim report, which you have reviewed and forwarded for my attention.
I am pleased that the Committee's interim report recognizes the serious efforts underway in the Administration to respond to the health concerns of Desert Storm veterans, and I thank you for your close cooperation with the Committee as it fulfills its charge. I trust that you will continue to work closely with the Committee as it prepares its final report.
I also request that you carefully review the recommendations and report back to me promptly with your plans for implementing the recommendations. As I said last March when announcing my intention to establish the Advisory Committee, we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to determine the causes of the illnesses experienced by Gulf War veterans and to provide the best possible medical care to those who are ill.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
