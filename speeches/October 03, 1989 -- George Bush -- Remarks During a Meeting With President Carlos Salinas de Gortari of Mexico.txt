    All of you from Mexico City and elsewhere, welcome!
Well, I normally don't say anything at a photo opportunity. But I just can't tell you how pleased we are to have the President of Mexico here in the White House, what an honor it was to have him and Mrs. Salinas up at Camp David for what was almost a family evening. But this is a very important visit for the United States. I hope you feel welcome; we want you all to feel very welcome.
