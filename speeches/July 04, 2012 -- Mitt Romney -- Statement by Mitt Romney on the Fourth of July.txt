    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the Fourth of July:
"Today we celebrate 236 years of the world's greatest design for liberty and self-government. As we gather to enjoy food and fireworks, let us also take a moment to pay tribute to the patriots who signed the Declaration of Independence -- and the brave men and women who have fought to protect our freedoms through every generation that has followed. With so many around the world still consigned to tyranny, the Fourth of July is a time to appreciate the blessing of liberty and be thankful that we are Americans."
