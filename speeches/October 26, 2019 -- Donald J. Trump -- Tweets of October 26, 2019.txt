Democrats just announced that they no longer want the Whistleblower to testify. But everything was about the Whistleblower (they no longer want the second Whistleblower either) which they don't want because the account of my call bore NO RELATIONSHIP to the call itself.....Retweets: 21549Favorites: 86834

....The entire Impeachment Scam was based on my perfect Ukrainian call and the Whistleblowers account of that call which turned out to be false (a fraud?). Once I released the actual call their entire case fell apart. The Democrats must end this Scam now. Witch Hunt!Retweets: 15893Favorites: 67066
