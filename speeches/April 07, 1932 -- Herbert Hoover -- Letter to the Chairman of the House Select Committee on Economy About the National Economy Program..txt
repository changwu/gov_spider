    My dear Mr. Chairman:
I am in receipt of your letter of April 6th. I greatly welcome the response of your committee to my suggestion that the fiscal situation necessitates honest, courageous and non-partisan action in the development of a national economy program and the preparation of a definite comprehensive bill that will assure its accomplishment. With this purpose in mind I would be glad if your committee would meet with me at this office at 11 o'clock on Saturday morning, April 9th with a view to taking stock of the progress made by your committee in the development of a program of economy, and affording the Executive an opportunity to make suggestions. Through the interchange of ideas we can thus lay the foundation for the development of such national program.
It is my understanding that your suggestion carries with it the thought that in such development the representatives whom I may appoint from the Executive branches of the government will sit in and cooperate with your committee. I shall continue to urge that a similar committee be appointed by the Senate in order that we shall not need to traverse the whole subject again.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. John McDuffie, Chairman, Economy Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.]
