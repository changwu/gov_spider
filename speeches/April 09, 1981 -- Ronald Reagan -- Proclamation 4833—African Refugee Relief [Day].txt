    By the President of the United States of AmericaA Proclamation
The American people are blessed with freedom and material abundance, yet they are not deaf to the cries of agony from those who suffer deprivation. Today, cries for help are heard from Africa where more than 4 million of our fellow human beings have been displaced.
The United States applauds the humanitarian efforts of the nations which take in these refugees. Host nations are often themselves poor in resources and their willingness to accept refugees is exemplary of the best in the human spirit.
Americans are a compassionate people and will do their part, either through government or through voluntary contributions.
With this in mind, Congress has, by joint resolution, requested me to designate April 9, 1981, as African Refugee Relief Day and to call upon the people of the United States to observe that day by increasing their awareness of the plight of the African refugee. Further, I call on Americans of all faiths to involve themselves directly in this problem with their prayers and with contributions to recognized private voluntary agencies which provide care and relief to African refugees.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate April 9, 1981, as African Refugee Relief Day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
