Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today for National African-American History Month:
"This month, we celebrate the many contributions and achievements of African-Americans. As a nation, we are inspired by courageous leaders and heroes like Frederick Douglass, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Jackie Robinson who tore down barriers and moved our country forward. Their legacy lives on in all of us.
"While acknowledging how far we have come as a nation, we must also look ahead to new challenges that we must confront together if the American Dream is to reach all corners of our country."
