HOUSTON, Texas — Today presidential candidate Ted Cruz warned that electing the wrong people to office has consequences for freedom. Cruz was referring to Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring's (D) unilateral announcement that he will no longer recognize the lawful permits for concealed carry holders from 25 states.
"As we have seen over and over again, criminals prey on the defenseless," said Cruz. "You don't reduce violent crime by taking away the right of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and their families."
Cruz went on to point out that as president, he would ensure that the Second Amendment rights of Americans were protected.
Cruz was campaigning today in southern March 1 primary states — states that have a high percentage of gun ownership. Virginia is also a March 1 primary state.
