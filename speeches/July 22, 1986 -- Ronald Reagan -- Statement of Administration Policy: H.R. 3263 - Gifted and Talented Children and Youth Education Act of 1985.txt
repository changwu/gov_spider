    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Biaggi (D) NY and 87 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3263 because the new grant program proposed by the bill duplicates program authority already existing under the Chapter 2 State block grant program of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act.
