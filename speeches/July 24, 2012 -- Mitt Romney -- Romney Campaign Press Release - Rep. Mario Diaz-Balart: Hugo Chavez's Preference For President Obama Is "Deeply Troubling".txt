    Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart today made the following statement on Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's favorable comments about President Obama:
"Given the way Barack Obama has downplayed the threat posed to the United States by Hugo Chavez, it's not a surprise that the Venezuelan dictator harbors strong hopes that President Obama wins re-election, going so far as to say that President Obama 'deep down is a good guy.' That a close friend and ally of Fidel Castro would voice his strong preference for President Obama is deeply troubling. We urgently need a change of course, and a new President in the White House."
