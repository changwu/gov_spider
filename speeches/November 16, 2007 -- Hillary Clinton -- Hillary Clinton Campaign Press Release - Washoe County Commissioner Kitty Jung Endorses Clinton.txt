    The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of Washoe County Commissioner Kitty Jung. Jung will work with the campaign to mobilize area residents to caucus for Senator Clinton in January. She will also join other northern Nevada leaders as a member of the campaign's Women's Leadership Council.
"I believe Senator Hillary Clinton is the candidate with the most strength and experience in the field. She has worked tirelessly throughout her career to improve the lives of average Americans and is prepared to lead our country at home and abroad," said Commissioner Jung. "As the daughter and wife of a veteran, I support Senator Clinton's commitment to restoring the promises guaranteed to enlistees, especially the promise of life-long health care coverage for Armed Forces retirees and veterans."
Commissioner Jung has a lengthy history of community service and advocacy. She is the only Democrat on the five-member Washoe County Commission. Prior to being appointed District Three Commissioner, Jung served as Community Liaison for the City of Reno, and has over 10 years of additional government and community relations experience. Previously, Kitty held the position of Business and Community Liaison for the Sierra Job Corps Center in Reno. She also has an extensive background as lecturer and instructor in the field of psychology, including two years in the Liberal Arts and Public Service Division at Truckee Meadows Community College where she earned a nomination for the Teacher of the Year Award.
"Kitty is a proven leader, well respected by Democrats and Republicans alike throughout Washoe County," said Clinton Northern Nevada Co-Chair Frankie Sue Del Papa. "She is a rising star in northern Nevada with a reputation for fighting hard for the issues Nevadans care about. We are so excited to have her energy and commitment helping our campaign mobilize Washoe County to caucus for Hillary."
