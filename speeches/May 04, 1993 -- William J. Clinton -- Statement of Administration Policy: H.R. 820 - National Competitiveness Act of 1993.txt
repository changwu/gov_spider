    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Valentine (D) North Carolina and 37 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 820, as reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. The Administration may seek certain improvements to the legislation as it continues through the legislative process.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 820 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that the pay-as-you-go effect is zero.
