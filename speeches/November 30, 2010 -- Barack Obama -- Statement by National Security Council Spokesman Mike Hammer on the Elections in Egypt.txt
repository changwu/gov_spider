    The United States is disappointed with the conduct during and leading up to Egypt’s November 28 legislative elections. While we are continuing to assess reports from a variety of sources, the numerous reported irregularities at the polls, the lack of international monitors and the many problems encountered by domestic monitors, and the restrictions on the basic freedoms of association, speech and press in the run-up to the elections are worrying. That being said, the United States commends those Egyptians who participated in the parliamentary elections on Sunday-as candidates, campaigners, voters and election monitors. The United States has a longstanding partnership with the people of Egypt, rooted in common interests and shared values. We look forward to continuing to work with the Egyptian Government and Egypt’s vibrant civil society to help Egypt achieve its political, social, and economic aspirations consistent with international standards.
