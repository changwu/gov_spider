    President Trump. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with a friend of mine—Emmanuel, thank you very much—the President of France, who's doing a terrific job being President of France. He's changing a lot of things around. And I guess that had to happen. And it's—I think it's going to be very successful. We have a tremendous relationship. We're discussing trade. We're discussing NATO. We're discussing a lot of different things. And hopefully, in the end, it will all work out. And so it's great to be with you.
President Macron. Thank you, Donald.

President Macron. I have to say, I told them exactly the same—[laughter]—but in French, for French journalists. And the fact that—no—you. I just reminded everybody that almost 1 year ago you were present with your wife and in Paris for, precisely, Bastille Day.
President Trump. That's right. That's right. Beautiful. It was beautiful.
President Macron. It was 13th and 14th of July. And we've worked together for—yes—12 months now.
President Trump. Sure.
President Macron. And took some great decisions. And——
President Trump. We've made some good decisions.
President Macron. And we'll continue to work together——
President Trump. That's right.
President Macron. ——on different issues.
President Trump. That's right. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Q. President Macron, do you agree that Angela Merkel is beholden to the Russians?
President Trump. Oh, I'm glad they asked you that. [Laughter]
Thank you. Thank you very much for asking him my question.
President Macron. No, I think——
Q. No?
President Macron. We just discussed the nature of that. We work together.
