    We're in a battle for the heart and soul of our party and our country, and nominating a candidate who represents the status quo will hand re-election to Donald Trump. There are plenty of candidates in this race who have offered glowing promises, but I'm the only candidate with the record of delivering on what others have only promised: universal pre-k, paid time off, and an expansion of health care. I'm looking forward to making this argument again at the coming debate.
