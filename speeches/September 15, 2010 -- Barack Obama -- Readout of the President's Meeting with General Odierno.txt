    The President met with General Odierno today to convey his personal gratitude for General Odierno's leadership of U.S. Forces in Iraq and his cumulative service of over four years in Iraq. He noted that General Odierno supervised the responsible drawdown in Iraq that removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops while supporting our diplomatic mission and bolstering Iraqi's forces in taking the lead for the security of the Iraqi people.
