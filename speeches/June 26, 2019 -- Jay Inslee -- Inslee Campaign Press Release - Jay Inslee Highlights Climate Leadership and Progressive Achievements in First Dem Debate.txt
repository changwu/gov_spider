    Miami, FL â€“ Tonight, Aisling Kerins, Campaign Manager for Inslee for America, released the following statement:
"Tonight, Jay Inslee successfully introduced his clear vision and record of progressive success in Washington state to the American people. He laid out why climate change needs to be the top issue for the next president - and why he has the strongest plan and best record to defeat the climate crisis. Governor Inslee also succeeded tonight in telling the story of progressive success in Washington state: expanding health care, welcoming immigrants, strengthening unions and building the best economy in America. It's clear from the applause in Miami that voters are looking for a leader with clear priorities on climate change and a record of progressive success.
"But in Miami, a city that will literally slip under the sea if we don't act, NBC and the DNC spent less than 8 minutes on the existential crisis of our time. The failure to fully address climate change is unacceptable. Tonight made clear that we need a climate debate now. The DNC failed to focus on this existential crisis, and that they must immediately allow a full debate on climate change."
