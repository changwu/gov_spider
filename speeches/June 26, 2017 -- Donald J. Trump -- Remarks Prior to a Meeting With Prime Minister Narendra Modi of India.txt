    President Trump. Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Modi of India who has been such a great Prime Minister. I've been speaking with him and reading about you—[laughter]—and you have done a great job. Economically, India is doing very well and in so many other ways.
So I'd like to congratulate you. I'd like to congratulate you very much.
[At this point, Prime Minister Modi spoke briefly in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Modi. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
President Trump. Would you like to say something?
[Prime Minister Modi made remarks in Hindi. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi then indicated to the interpreter to translate his remarks as follows.]
Prime Minister Modi. I think I will have a lot to speak after the meeting. But the way I've been welcomed by the honorable President and the First Lady in Washington, DC, I'm extremely grateful to them, for the respect and for the grand welcome. This is a welcome of 1.25 billion people of India. So I'm grateful to the honorable President and the First Lady.
I do remember very well that then-President Trump—when he was not even President, had visited India. And when in an media interview he was asked about me, he was full of very warm remarks and observations for me. I still remember them today. I'm extremely grateful, but of course, I will have a lot to speak after the meeting.
Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody.
