At this point, we don't have a completely accurate translation. We're attempting to get one and also to obtain clarification of the action by the Majles. The decision is now in the hands of the executive officers of Iran and the United Statesâ€”their legislative branch having acted.
The President will be consulting with his senior foreign policy advisers in Washington. We will respond to the Iranian action in accordance with American law and the two principles that have guided our actions throughout; namely, the national interest of this country and our concern for the safe and early release of the hostages. We will keep the press and public informed of developments to the maximum extent possible and of the full details of any actions taken by the United States Government.
The President was notified of the action of the Majles shortly before 4 a.m. CST by Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The decision to return to Washington was in effect reconfirmed at that time. It had been our view since the beginning of this latest phase that the President ought to return to Washington if there was a prospect that major decisions had to be made, simply because of the greater access to his advisers and the advantages in communications afforded by the White House.
The President also instructed Secretary of State Muskie shortly after 4 o'clock to begin briefing the congressional leadership and to begin briefing Governor Reagan and Congressman Anderson.
