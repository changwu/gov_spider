    CHARLESTON, S.C. â€“ For the fourth debate in a row, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders was the clear winner, according to a focus group, Twitter, Facebook, Google searches, online polls and money raised.
Twenty-seven out of 30 undecided South Carolinians who participated in a dial test focus group felt Sanders was the winner of the Charleston debate. "Sanders wins SC in blowout," Chris Kofinis of Park Street Strategies, who ran the survey, tweeted. "He is connecting with many of the African American voters in this group."
Sanders was the most searched candidate on Google, the top candidate discussed on Twitter and Facebook and picked up the most followers on Twitter. Notably, Governor O'Malley gained more Twitter followers Sunday night than Secretary Hillary Clinton.
Sanders won the online TIME Magazine poll with 87 percent of the vote and won an online Univision poll with 68 percent of the vote.
The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza said Sanders was a winner in the debate because "he was the prime mover in virtually every discussion from Wall Street reform to health care to climate change. He was on offense, accusing rival Hillary Clinton of half-measures and political caution at a moment when boldness is required."
As the debate closed, the campaign was raking in 3.2 contributions per second. Sanders raised one million dollars Sunday from more than 36,000 contributions.
