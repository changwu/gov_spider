    This Sunday millions of Americans of every faith will attend worship services. We have much to give thanks for in this country. But I ask that each of you say a special prayer this Sunday for the American hostages being held in Lebanon.
In the last several days, we have all struggled with the reality of Americans being held in a foreign land, tortured, and sometimes killed by their captors. Even as we search for political solutions to this problem, I believe that prayer is the most important way to deal with the human response to this tragic situation. I believe in prayer. It gives us strength in times of need. It gives us hope in times of despair. It gives us optimism in times of opportunity. So, I ask again that each of you join me this Sunday in saying a special prayer for the American hostages, their families, and their friends.
