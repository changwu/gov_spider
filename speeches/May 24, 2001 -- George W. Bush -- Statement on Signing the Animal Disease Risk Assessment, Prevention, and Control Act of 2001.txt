    Today I am signing into law S. 700, the "Animal Disease Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001." The Act is intended to assist the Department of Agriculture in its continuing efforts to protect against introduction into the United States of two unrelated animal diseases occurring abroadâ€”bovine spongiform encephalopathy and foot-and-mouth disease. Preventing such diseases from entering the United States is a high priority, and the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, has put strong measures in place designed to accomplish that goal.
Section 3 of the bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit to certain committees and subcommittees of the Congress a preliminary report concerning any immediate needs for additional legislative authority or appropriations and a final report with recommendations for legislation that will improve efforts to assess, prevent, or control transmission of certain diseases. Section 3 will be interpreted in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to recommend to the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient.
