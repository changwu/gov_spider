    The President and First Lady announced today that this year's White House Easter Egg Roll will be held on Monday, April 5, 2010 with the theme of "Ready, Set, Go!" promoting health and wellness. The event will feature live music, sports courts, cooking stations, storytelling and, of course, Easter egg rolling. All of the activities will encourage children to lead healthy and active lives and follow the First Lady's 'Let's Move!' initiative, a national campaign to combat childhood obesity. The White House will open its South Lawn for children aged 12 years and younger and their families.
White House Easter Egg Roll tickets will be distributed through an online lottery system, allowing guests from across the United States to participate in a tradition that dates back to 1878. The lottery will open for entries on February 25th and close on February 28th. Full ticketing details can be found at www.whitehouse.gov/eastereggroll.
