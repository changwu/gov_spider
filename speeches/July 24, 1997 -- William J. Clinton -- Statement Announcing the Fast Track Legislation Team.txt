    I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jason S. Berman to serve as Special Counselor to the President and coordinate the administration's effort to pass fast track legislation.
During his tenure at the White House, Mr. Berman will take a leave of absence from his current position as chairman of the Recording Industry Association of America. I am grateful to him for setting aside this work to join our team. Mr. Berman's extensive knowledge of trade policy and unparalleled experience on the Hill will be invaluable to our effort.
I am also pleased to announce that I have asked Victoria L. Radd, an outstanding member of my staff, to join Mr. Berman in coordinating this effort. Ms. Radd is an Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to Erskine Bowles. During the past 4 years, she has also served as Associate Counsel to the President and as Deputy Director of Communications. Prior to joining the White House, she was a partner in the law firm of Williams & Connolly.
The economic strategy of my administration, based on reducing the deficit, investing in the education and skills of our people, and opening markets, has helped produce the strongest economy in the world. I am calling on the Congress to enact fast track legislation so we can continue our aggressive drive to open markets to our goods and services and create more high skilled jobs for the American people. Every President, Republican and Democrat, in the past two decades has had this vital tool to maintain effective American leadership in the global economy. Fast track authority is in the national interest of the United States, and my appointment of Jay Berman makes clear my determination to fight for passage of this important legislation.
