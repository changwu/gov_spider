    I am pleased to announce the completion of a strong set of guidelines for environmental review of major new trade agreements. These detailed guidelines, required by an Executive order I issued last year, will ensure that we fully integrate environmental considerations into our negotiation of new trade agreements and will provide unparalleled opportunities for public involvement in trade policy. America's experience has proven that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand in hand, and these new guidelines will help protect the global environment as we work with other nations to build prosperity worldwide. Bringing environmental issues into the mainstream of our trade policy has been a top priority for my administration. The guidelines issued by the United States Trade Representative and the Council on Environmental Quality are another major milestone in this effort.
