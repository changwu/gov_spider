    Karen Hughes, Counselor to President George W. Bush, today announced that Dan Bartlett has been named White House Communications Director.
"Dan Bartlett has sound judgment, strong organizational skills and an outstanding ability to communicate our compassionate conservative message. He is a trusted advisor and an integral part of the White House team," said President Bush.
Bartlett is currently Deputy Assistant to the President and principal deputy to Mrs. Hughes, who as part of her role as Counselor oversees the White House offices of Communications, Press Secretary, Media Affairs and Speechwriting. Today's announcement formalizes a leadership role that Bartlett has increasingly played since the beginning of the Administration. The Communications office oversees message and communications development and planning, and works with the Advance office on planning and production of presidential events. Bartlett will continue to serve as principal deputy to Mrs. Hughes in addition to his responsibilities as Communications Director.
Before joining the Bush Administration, Mr. Bartlett served as a senior spokesman and the Director of Rapid Response for the Bush for President campaign in Austin, Texas. He has served President Bush since 1993, working on both successful campaigns for Governor of Texas. From 1994 to 1998, Bartlett worked in the Governor's Office as Deputy to the Policy Director. During the 1998 reelection campaign, he served as Issues Director. Before joining President Bush, Mr. Bartlett worked for Karl Rove and Associates, an Austin-based political consulting firm. He earned his degree in political science from the University of Texas at Austin.
