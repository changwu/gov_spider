    In coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), First Lady Melania Trump has issued a public service announcement asking Americans to take action in support of disaster survivors following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
The severity and impact of the storms in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico have led to recovery efforts that will continue for months and years to come. It will take the combined efforts of Federal, State, tribal, territorial, and local agencies working together with non-profit, voluntary, faith-based, and private sector organizations to recover from these devastating storms, rebuild stronger than before, and help make these areas more resilient.
As Mrs. Trump stated, "[w]e have certainly seen the unforgiving side of Mother Nature these past few weeks, and my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families so deeply affected by the hurricanes. I will continue to lend my voice, time, and resources to help those in need."
