    ATLANTA — Georgia Right to Life endorsed today Newt Gingrich for President of the United States, calling his election "essential" to protecting "the most helpless members of our human family."
Gingrich, who represented Georgia's 6th District in Congress from January 1979 to November 1998, has been an outspoken advocate for protecting those who cannot speak for themselves.
Emily's List, a liberal political action committee known for supporting abortion rights, ranked Gingrich in December as the worst among GOP Presidential candidates because of his strong pro life scorecard and agenda.
Gingrich has pledged to appoint pro-life judges to the U.S. Supreme Court, end taxpayer funding of abortion, defund Planned Parenthood and sign aggressive abortion restrictions into law.
"As a candidate who has demonstrated a willingness to stand for the sanctity of life, we are especially pleased to commend you and look forward to working with you during your term as President," wrote Daniel Becker, GRTL's President, and Melanie Crozier, GRTL's PAC letter in a letter to Gingrich released today.
Gingrich, who will be in Georgia next week, called the endorsement "one of the most important of my campaign."
"The right to life is so basic that our Founding Fathers described the inalienable right as a ‘self evident' truth in the Declaration of Independence — and one that we are endowed with by Our Creator," Gingrich said. "Without the unalienable right, we are no different than nations that preceded us. A great nation must work diligently to protect life, and as President we will protect life."
