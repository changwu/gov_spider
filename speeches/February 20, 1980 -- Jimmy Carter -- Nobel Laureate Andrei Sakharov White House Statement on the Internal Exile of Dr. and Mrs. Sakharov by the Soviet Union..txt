    The maltreatment of Dr. Andrei Sakharov and his wife in Gorky is deplorable. It is not enough, it seems, to have subjected this valiant couple to internal exile for their principles and their courageous stand for human rights and dignity in the Soviet Union. Now they are subjected to physical indignity and harm.
Resolutions have been passed by the United States House of Representatives and the Senate urging the Soviet Union to release Dr. Sakharov from internal exile. The United States urges others at home and abroad to join in seeking to persuade the Soviet Union to allow Dr. Sakharov to pursue his intellectual and professional work in accord with the guarantees of the Soviet Constitution and the Helsinki Final Act.
