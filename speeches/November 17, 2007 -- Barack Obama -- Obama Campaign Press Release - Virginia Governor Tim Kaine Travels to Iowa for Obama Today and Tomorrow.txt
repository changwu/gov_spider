Des Moines, IA -- Today and tomorrow, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine will travel to Iowa to discuss why Senator Obama is the best candidate to move our country past red state and blue state divides and unite us on the values we share. Governor Kaine will make stops in Cedar Rapids, Vinton, Waverly, Charles City, Osage, Mason City, Algona, Fort Dodge and Webster City.
"In Virginia and the rest of our great nation, people from across the political spectrum are excited by Senator Obama's commitment to uniting our country to make progress on the on issues that matter to everyday Americans," said Kaine. "Barack Obama is the best candidate to lead America because he has the experience we need to challenge the conventional thinking in Washington and bring us together to work towards common goals."
Tim Kaine was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia after serving one term as Lieutenant Governor. A graduate of University of Missouri and Harvard Law School, Kaine also worked as a missionary in Honduras, taught legal ethics at the University of Richmond Law School and served as Mayor of the City of Richmond.
Two weeks ago, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle from South Dakota, former Oklahoma U.S. Congressman Brad Carson, and former Governor of Mississippi Ray Mabus traveled to Iowa. The three prominent red-state Democrats spoke to Iowans about Senator Obama's bipartisan accomplishments and commitment to changing our politics in Washington, D.C. Last week, the campaign announced the support of 268 Iowa Republicans.
