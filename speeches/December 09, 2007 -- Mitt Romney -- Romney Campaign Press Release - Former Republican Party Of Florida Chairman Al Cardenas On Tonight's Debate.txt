Boston, MA â€“ Tonight, Al Cardenas, former Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida and a Chairman of the Romney for President National Hispanic Steering Committee, released the following statement on the Univision Republican Presidential Forum at the University of Miami:
"This evening, Governor Romney gave a winning performance in the historic Univision Republican Presidential Forum, speaking frankly, openly and warmly about the issues most important to Hispanic voters and demonstrating that he is the only candidate that can bring true conservative change to Washington. On every issue raised, Governor Romney proved he is the leader that can apply conservative principles to strengthen our military, economy and families. Additionally, I am confident that Governor Romney's plan to improve our legal immigration policies and adopt sensible immigration reform will be embraced by the majority of Hispanics in our country. Tonight's debate was a tremendous opportunity for voters in the Hispanic community to learn more about Governor Romney's experience, vision and values."
