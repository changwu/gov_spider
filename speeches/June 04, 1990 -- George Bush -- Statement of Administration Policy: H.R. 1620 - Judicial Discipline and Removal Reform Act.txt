    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Kastenmeier (D) Wisconsin and 2 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1620 in its current form and urges that it not be considered under suspension of the rules.
The Administration supports the underlying thrust of H.R. 1620. However, the Administration strongly opposes the provision which includes the "appointments process" within the jurisdiction of a National Commission on Judicial Impeachment. The Presidential nomination and Senatorial advice and consent system has worked quite well for the past 200 years. The appointments process should not be a part of the mandate of such a Commission.
