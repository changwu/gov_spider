    AUSTIN â€” Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement on the Supreme Court's stay on Texas' HB2 law:
"The Supreme Court's stay unnecessarily puts lives in danger by allowing unsafe facilities to continue to perform abortions. I am confident the court will ultimately uphold these commonsense measures to protect the health and safety of Texas women."
