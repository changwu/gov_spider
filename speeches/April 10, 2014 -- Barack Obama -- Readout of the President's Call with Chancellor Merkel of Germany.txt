    President Obama spoke today with Chancellor Merkel about the concerning situation in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists, apparently with support from Moscow, continue an orchestrated campaign of incitement and sabotage to undermine and destabilize the Ukrainian state. The leaders again called for Russia to move its troops back from the border region. They also discussed issues relating to the forthcoming meeting of the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. foreign ministers and EU High Representative. The two leaders commended the Ukrainian government's efforts to move forward on constitutional reform, decentralization, and democratic elections and emphasized the importance of the international community's strong financial support for Ukraine. The President underscored the need for the United States, European Union, and other global partners to be prepared to meet further Russian escalation with additional sanctions. The President and the Chancellor look forward to continuing their discussion during her forthcoming visit to Washington.
