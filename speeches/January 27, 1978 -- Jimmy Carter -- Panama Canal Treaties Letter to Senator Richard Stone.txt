    To Senator Richard Stone
Thank you for meeting with me yesterday about the Panama Canal Treaties. You have expressed concerns that are shared by many of our citizens in Florida and throughout the nation.
Ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties should not be viewed by any power as signaling a retreat by the United States in Latin America. Our country will continue to play a visible and dynamic role in Western Hemisphere affairs.
In particular, it has been and will continue to be the policy of the United States to oppose any efforts, direct or indirect, by the Soviet Union to establish military bases in the Western Hemisphere. Moreover, we will maintain our military bases in the Caribbean necessary to the defense of the Panama Canal and the security of the United States and its allies in the Western Hemisphere.
You have asked when the Government of Panama plans to hold Assembly elections. I am pleased to inform you that Panama will hold elections for its National Assembly on August 6 of this year. The newly-elected members will take office in October.
You have done much to clarify ambiguities that have developed during the debate on the Panama Canal Treaties. I believe the Treaties are very important to the continuing improvement in our relations with Latin America and I hope they will have your support.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Richard Stone, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510]
