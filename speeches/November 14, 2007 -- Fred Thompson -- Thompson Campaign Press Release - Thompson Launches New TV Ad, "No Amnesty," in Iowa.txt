McLean, VA - Following up on his tough Border Security and Immigration Reform Plan which emphasizes the need to secure our borders and enforce the law, Senator Fred Thompson launched a new 30-second television ad, titled "No Amnesty," that will begin airing today statewide in Iowa. The 30-second spot is set in a diner, featuring the Senator sitting at a counter discussing the problem of illegal immigration.
The spot, titled "No Amnesty," can be viewed at http://www.fred08.com.
Below is a transcript of the new advertisement.
No Amnesty (30 seconds)
Americans know we have an illegal immigration problem.
And most of us have a good idea about how to start fixing it-secure our borders, and enforce the law.
Giving up, by granting amnesty is not the answer.
It's unfair to those who have played by the rules and ignores the rule of law.
It's also a matter of national security.
We can do a lot better than this and with your help we will.
I'm Fred Thompson and I approve this message.
