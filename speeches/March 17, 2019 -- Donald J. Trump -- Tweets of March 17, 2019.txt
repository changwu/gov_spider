It's truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live not funny/no talent can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me) over & over without so much of a mention of 'the other side.' Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows......Retweets: 19575Favorites: 101141

So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) 'last in his class' (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He & the Dems working together failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!Retweets: 1435Favorites: 4488

Those Republican Senators who voted in favor of Strong Border Security (and the Wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their States. They know there is a National Emergency at the Southern Border and they had the courage to ACT. Great job!Retweets: 21538Favorites: 91771
