Nicaragua-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President, is it now time to sever diplomatic relations with Nicaragua?
The President. No. I have told the State Department to send their Ambassador and seven comrades back to Managua, and the other is a possibility always that we could do. But we'll just return those individuals.
Q. What do you mean? In defiance of the Nicaraguans, they would go—they would stay there? I don't understand.
The President. Why, in other words, we're going to return the favor. We're going to do to him what he did to us.
Q. But that won't be a break in relations—
The President. No
Q. —as such. You'll keep someone there or a skeleton operation?
The President. Yes, there are some people that were not ejected, that are still there, and the same would be true here. But the other remains always an option.

Q. Is that possible?
The President. I think so.
