    President Donald J. Trump continues to receive updates from Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long and his Department of Homeland Security team, who are engaged in lifesaving and life-sustaining response operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The President continues to direct all necessary Federal resources to protect the people of the United States territories affected by Hurricane Maria and to support response and recovery efforts with respect to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. He and the First Lady send their thoughts and prayers to all those in harm's way.
