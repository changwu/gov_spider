    (SAN FRANCISCO, September 18, 2019) — Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement after Donald Trump announced that his administration will revoke California's legal authority to set tailpipe pollution rules:
"In 2019, whether or not to respond to our climate crisis is not a relevant question for a responsible person. Donald Trump is not a responsible person. Anyone who cares about the health and safety of Americans knows we must respond. His attempts to strip California's Air Resource Board of its legal authority is a dereliction of his duty as president and an act of incompetence. It is political pandering to his oil company paymasters that is shameless and shockingly short-sighted.
If American business really cares about its responsibilities to our country — and not just its bottom line — now is the time to stand up to a disastrous policy and a failed president. If they do not, their plans for 'broader goals' and 'triple bottom lines' are just empty promises."
Read Tom's Justice-Centered Climate Plan, where he lays out his strategy of declaring the climate crisis a national emergency on day one, and will use the powers of the presidency to put us on a course to eliminating asthma-causing toxic air pollution from new cars, pickups, and SUVs by 2030.
