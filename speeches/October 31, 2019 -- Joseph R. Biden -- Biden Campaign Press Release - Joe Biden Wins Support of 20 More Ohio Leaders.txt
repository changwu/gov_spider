    Today, Biden for President announced endorsements from 20 current and former elected officials and community leaders from across Ohio â€“ a critical swing state that Joe Biden's experience, strong record of progressive accomplishments, and ability to unify the country have best positioned him to win.
Today's supporters include former longtime Ohio Congressman Edward Feighan and a group of influential mayors and city officials. They join 19 other Ohio state legislators and community leaders who backed Joe ahead of the fourth Democratic debate last month.
"We are proud to earn the trust and support of these respected leaders who are supporting Joe as he fights to rebuild the middle class, champion the dignity of work, and stand with union members and their families," said Greg Schultz, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "As a native Buckeye, I know that all eyes turn to Ohio during the election, and our campaign intends to compete for every vote and make Donald Trump a one-term president. Ohioans know that we need a leader who can not only go toe-to-toe with Trump in crucial battleground states like Ohio, but who can beat him like a drum. That leader is Joe Biden."
