Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding Chile's Independence Day:
"As Chile celebrates the 197th anniversary of its independence, we send our best wishes to the people of Chile as well as Chilean-American communities across the United States. We also honor the many contributions of Chilean-Americans to the United States that have been achieved because of their talents, drive and values.
"Chileans have built strong political institutions and the rule of law, while waging a series of spirited and issues-oriented elections to choose their leaders. These contests have served as shining examples of the democratic gains that have been achieved in Chile, where officials are committed to democracy, promoting economic opportunity and rewarding individual achievement.
"Chile is also an important partner for the United States. The U.S.-Chile free trade agreement approved earlier this decade has helped cement the ties that unite us with positive results for both countries. Chile's example of promoting economic freedom has been an example for the region and the world. Our ties have been strengthened as we work with Chile to promote our common values around the world and on issues of mutual interest like security, diplomacy, culture and technology."
