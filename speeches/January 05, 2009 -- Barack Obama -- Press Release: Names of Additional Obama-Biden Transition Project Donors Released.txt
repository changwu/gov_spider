    In keeping with President-elect Obama's pledge to run the most open and transparent transition in history, the Obama-Biden Transition Project has voluntarily chosen to release the names of its donors on a monthly basis. Typically, transition donors are released after the transition period is complete.  As of December 15th, 2008, a total of $3,803,222.48 had been raised from 53,853 donors. The average donation is $70.62 per donor.
The Obama-Biden Transition Project only accepts contributions from individuals' personal funds—we refuse all donations from corporations, labor unions and PACs. Individuals may not donate more than $5,000. We also refuse all contributions from registered federal lobbyists and registered foreign agents.
