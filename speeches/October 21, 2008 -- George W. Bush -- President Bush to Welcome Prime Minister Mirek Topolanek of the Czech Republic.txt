    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic to the White House on October 29, 2008. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Topolanek, the close partnership between the Czech Republic and the United States has deepened across a range of global strategic priorities including promoting freedom in repressive societies, supporting security and development in Iraq and Afghanistan, advancing European energy security, and countering new ballistic missile threats to Europe and the United States from the Middle East. The President looks forward to discussing these issues with Prime Minister Topolanek, as well as continuing his consultations on the financial crisis.
