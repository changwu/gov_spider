Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, Mitch's boy, should just let it play out. South Dakota doesn't like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!Retweets: 49649Favorites: 224296

They are slow walking the signature verification in Georgia. They don't want results to get out prior to January 6th. They know what they are trying so hard to hide. Terrible people! @BrianKempGARetweets: 73872Favorites: 291241

Our embassy in Baghdad got hit Sunday by several rockets. Three rockets failed to launch. Guess where they were from: IRAN. Now we hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq... https://t.co/0OCL6IFp5M Retweets: 63205Favorites: 233517

After seeing the massive Voter Fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election, I disagree with anyone that thinks a strong, fast, and fair Special Counsel is not needed, IMMEDIATELY. This was the most corrupt election in the history of our Country, and it must be closely examined!Retweets: 87025Favorites: 328025
