    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 995, the "Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994."
Today there are members of the National Guard and Reserve, including Coast Guard Reservists, on active duty supporting operational missions. As their Commander in Chief, it is timely for me to sign a bill that will clarify and strengthen their right to return to the civilian positions they held before going on active duty without any loss of seniority, status, or pay.
The "Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994" revises, improves, and clarifies the existing veterans reemployment rights statute, which was first enacted in 1940. Since that time, a confusing and cumbersome patchwork of statutory amendments and judicial constructions have made the law difficult for employers to understand.
Among other changes, H.R. 995 extends coverage for the first time to the Coast Guard and Public Health Service Reserve components.
It also entitles service members to continued health insurance coverage under their employer's plan for up to 18 months of military leave and makes explicit the rights of reemployed service members under their pension plans.
My Administration is committed to enforcing the reemployment rights of service members. This Act is key to the achievement of that goal.
