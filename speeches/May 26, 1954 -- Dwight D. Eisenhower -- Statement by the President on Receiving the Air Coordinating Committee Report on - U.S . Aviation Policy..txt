    BECAUSE the last comprehensive review of United States aviation policy was completed approximately six years ago, current guidance is critically needed by the aviation industry, by government and by the public.
On September 23, 1953, I requested that the Honorable Robert B. Murray, Jr., as Chairman of the Air Coordinating Committee, direct that committee to review and, for my consideration, make recommendations on United States aviation policy. The report was prepared with the help of appropriate representatives of the aviation industry, local governments and other groups directly concerned with aviation matters. The Committee has accomplished this task in a fashion that could make its report a milestone in the progress of American aviation.
The report has been presented to me, and reflects this Administration's central objective in this field--to strengthen American aviation. In order to carry out this broad policy, the Committee has made certain specific recommendations in such phases of aviation as air transport routes and subsidy, air cargo, airports and airways, aviation safety, mobilization planning, and some aspects of aircraft manufacturing. In each case, the Committee has been guided by the desire to promote the most effective government relationship with the civil aviation industry and to gain the greatest public benefit from every dollar of Government aid expended.
I shall use this report as a guide in the future consideration of questions related to the subject of civil aviation and in making appropriate recommendations to Congress. The review is released for general distribution and information.
