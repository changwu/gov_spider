    'Trust' ad will show on national television to debate audience
LAKE JACKSON, Texasâ€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced a day after the release of its latest advertisement, "Trust", that the spot will be running twice nationally during tonight's Republican presidential debate. The ad draws a sharp contrast, pointing out Paul's longtime conservative credentials and early support of Ronald Reagan, while pointing out Rick Perry's former chairmanship of Al Gore's presidential campaign.
"With the airing of this ad nationally during the debate we want to point out that Congressman Paul has an unparalleled record of championing true conservative principles, and his message of limited Constitutional government, sound money and balanced budgets have won the day," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Other candidates are parroting Dr. Paul's principles in their rhetoric, but their records prove they cannot be trusted to live up to their words."
The ad also notes the similarities between the candidacies of Paul and Reagan, with both being attacked by the political establishment as "too extreme" and questioning their electability. Reagan, like Paul, was dismissed by the establishment elites. Congressman Paul was one of only four Congressmen to endorse Ronald Reagan against incumbent Gerald Ford and lead the Texas delegation for Reagan to the 1976 Republican National Convention.
