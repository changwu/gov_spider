    Phil Singer, Deputy Communications Director, issued the following statement tonight:
For months, Barack Obama and his campaign have relentlessly attacked Hillary Clinton's character and integrity by using Republican talking points from the 1990s. The shame is his.
Sen. Clinton does know better -- she knows better than to condescend and talk down to voters like Senator Obama did. Senator Obama's outburst won't change the fact that he has embraced his characterization of the millions of Americans who live in small towns.
