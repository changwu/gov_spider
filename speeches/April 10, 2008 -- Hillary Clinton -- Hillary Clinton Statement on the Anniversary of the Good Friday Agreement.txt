    Today we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the historic Good Friday Agreement, which paved the way to peace in Northern Ireland. On this anniversary, I salute the brave and tireless efforts of the parties to the agreement -- and especially the people of Northern Ireland -- and I pledge my continued commitment to promoting a lasting and prosperous peace.
I know well how difficult it was to secure the Good Friday Agreement; how much work and sacrifice it took on all sides to bring about the peace; and how much effort has gone into implementing its tenets and building a new government in Northern Ireland.
Ultimately, the real credit for peace can only go to the brave people of Northern Ireland, as well as the leaders of Ireland and the U.K. But I also know that helping to advance the peace process and to achieve the Good Friday Agreement is one of my husband's proudest accomplishments as President. And I too am proud to have played a role in that effort.
In the Senate, I have continued to work on behalf of the peace process, providing whatever support and assistance I can to the stakeholders on all sides. And when I am President, I will continue my deep commitment to Northern Ireland. I will appoint a White House special envoy and lend my personal offices to promote lasting peace and reconciliation and to support the Northern Ireland government. I will pursue diplomatic engagement and robust economic partnerships. And my administration will strengthen the ties between the governments of the United States and all of Ireland, as well as our peoples.
