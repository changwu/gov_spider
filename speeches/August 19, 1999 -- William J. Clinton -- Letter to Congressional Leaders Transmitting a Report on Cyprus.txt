    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period April 1, 1999, to May 31, 1999. The previous submission covered events during February 1999 and March 1999.
NATO's 50th Anniversary Summit in Washington this past April brought an opportunity to engage with Greek and Turkish leaders on the Cyprus problem. I met there with Turkish President Demirel and Greek Prime Minister Simitis to underscore the importance of a just and lasting solution for all Cypriots. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright delivered a similar message to her Greek and Turkish counterparts in discussions on the possibilities for resuming negotiations in the fall. My Administration will continue efforts to bring about a settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
