    The United States strongly supports the humanitarian ceasefire announced in Gaza this evening. We urge all parties to act with restraint until this humanitarian ceasefire begins at 8:00 a.m. local time on Friday, August 1, 2014, and to fully abide by their commitments.
We believe the only sustainable way to address Israel's security concerns and enable Palestinians in Gaza to lead normal lives is through a permanent cease-fire agreement. We urge the Israeli and Palestinian delegations to begin negotiations immediately in Cairo, at the invitation of Egypt, aimed at achieving a durable ceasefire. The United States stands ready to support the successful conclusion of these negotiations, working with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, the United Nations, and other partners in the region.
