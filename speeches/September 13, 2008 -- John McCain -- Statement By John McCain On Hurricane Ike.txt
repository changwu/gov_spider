    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on Hurricane Ike:
"Today, Cindy and I join every American in offering prayers and assistance to those along the Gulf Coast reeling from the damage done by Hurricane Ike. The scope of the destruction is not yet clear, but yesterday I was briefed by U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and Texas Governor Rick Perry about the status of their response operation. Their combined determination to address immediate evacuations and relief support was encouraging, but I am increasingly concerned that there may have been a substantial loss of life. We do know that the economic impact from this storm will be severe. Like most Americans this morning, my concern has been reinforced by scenes of widespread flooding and ferocious winds. And like most Americans, I remain concerned about the impact this storm will have on gas prices across the country, but our priority now must be to help the relief effort in any way we can, and to pray for the safety of those in the s torm's path."
