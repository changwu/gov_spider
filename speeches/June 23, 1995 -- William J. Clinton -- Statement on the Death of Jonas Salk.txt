    Hillary and I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Dr. Jonas Salk, a man whose indefatigable pursuit of solutions made this world a better place to live. The victory of this medical pioneer over a dreaded disease continues to touch many, from the students who study his work to the countless individuals whose lives have been saved by his efforts. His polio vaccine opened the door to a society in which good health was taken for granted. And, over the last decade, his efforts to find a cure for AIDS gave us all hope. He was a true leader, and we will miss him greatly.
