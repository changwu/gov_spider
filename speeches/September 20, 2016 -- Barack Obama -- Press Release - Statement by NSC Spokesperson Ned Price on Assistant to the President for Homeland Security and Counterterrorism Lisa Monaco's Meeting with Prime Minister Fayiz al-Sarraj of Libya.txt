    Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco met today with Libyan Prime Minister Fayiz al-Sarraj on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss U.S.-Libyan counterterrorism cooperation and other efforts by the Government of National Accord (GNA) on behalf of the Libyan people. During the meeting, Ms. Monaco and Prime Minister Sarraj reviewed the progress of GNA forces in regaining Sirte from ISIL fighters and U.S. support for those Libyan-led efforts. They also discussed the GNA's plans to stabilize the city after ISIL fighters are cleared out of Sirte. Ms. Monaco congratulated Prime Minister Sarraj on the recent Libyan effort, with international support, to remove chemical weapons precursors from Libya and ensure that they did not fall into the hands of ISIL or other terrorist groups. Prime Minister Sarraj and Ms. Monaco underscored the importance of expanded efforts by the GNA to propose a new cabinet and for the House of Representatives to hold a vote to endorse the cabinet without delay.
