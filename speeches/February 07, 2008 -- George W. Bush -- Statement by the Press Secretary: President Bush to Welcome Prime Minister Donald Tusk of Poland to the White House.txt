    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland to the White House on March 10, 2008. Poland is a close partner of the United States in pursuing our common strategic objectives of advancing global freedom and security. A leader within Europe for promoting the development of strong democracies in Europe's East, Poland is helping to consolidate democratic gains in Ukraine and Georgia and to strengthen the democratic opposition to the regime in Belarus, Europe's last dictatorship. Poland is also a strong voice within Europe for promoting European energy security.
Poland has been a leading contributor for five years in the effort to secure freedom in Iraq, and is helping to meet the need for further contributions to the security and development of Afghanistan. Poland is also a valuable partner in responding to emerging threats, and has expressed interest in contributing to a missile defense system. The President looks forward to discussing these and other issues of common concern with the Prime Minister, who is making his first visit to the United States since he took office in November 2007.
