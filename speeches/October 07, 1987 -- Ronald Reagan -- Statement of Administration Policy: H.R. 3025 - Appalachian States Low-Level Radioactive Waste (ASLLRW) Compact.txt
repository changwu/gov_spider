    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Carper (D) AL and 29 others)
The administration has no objection to enactment of H.R. 3025, if the bill is amended to remove the authority of the ASLLRW Commission to enforce Federal law. Without this amendment, the Commission members, who are appointed by the ASLLRW member states, would be operating in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the commission members would not be appointed by the President.
