    The following statement was prepared by the President on July 15, 1940, and transmitted to Senator Alben Barkley, the Permanent Chairman of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Ill., on July 16, 1940, to be read by him at the end of his speech to the Convention. The statement was read by Senator Barkley at the end of his address as Permanent Chairman on the evening of July 16th, adding at the conclusion of the statement the phrase "by authority of his word."
I and other close friends of the President have long known that he has no wish to be a candidate again. We know, too, that in no way whatsoever has he exerted any influence in the selection of delegates or upon the opinions of delegates.
Tonight, at the specific request and authorization of the President, I am making this simple fact clear to the Convention.
The President has never had, and has not today, any desire or purpose to continue in the office of President, to be a candidate for that office, or to be nominated by the Convention for that office.
He wishes in all earnestness and sincerity to make it clear that all the delegates to this Convention are free to vote for any candidate.
That is the message I bear to you from the President of the United States.
