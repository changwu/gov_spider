    Today former Congresswoman Melissa Hart (R-PA) announced her support for Ohio Governor John Kasich for president.
"I support John Kasich because he is exactly what we need in our President," said Congresswoman Hart. "From balancing the federal budget as chairman of the Budget Committee to his leadership as the governor of Ohio, John Kasich has proven he is a reformer and a champion of pro-growth and commonsense solutions. Governor Kasich's bold ideas and ability to get things done is exactly why he is consistently projected to win against Hillary Clinton." 

Congresswoman Hart, a resident of Allegheny county, represented Pennsylvania's 4th district from 2001-2006. Previously, she served in the Pennsylvania State Senate for 10 years. 
"I would like to thank Congresswoman Hart for her support," Kasich said. "She is a remarkable Pennsylvanian who has dedicated her career to advancing smart conservative solutions to help more people in her state get ahead and reach their full potential. She is a great asset to our team and I appreciate all her efforts to share my message to voters."
