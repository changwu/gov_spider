    Thank you, Mr. Mayor. There you go. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Listen, thank you all for coming out to say hello. As you can see, I'm taking a bus trip. [Laughter] It's a fantastic way to see your beautiful State. I get to wave to people, shake some hands, and tell people that I'm running for a reason. I want this country to be a safer country, a stronger country, and a better country.
I'm proud to be with Mike and Fran DeWine and Congressman Dave Hobson. I want to thank you for coming out to say hello. I'm asking for your help. I'm asking for your vote. We've going to win Ohio again. We're going to win in November.
God bless you all. Thanks for coming. Great to see you all. Thanks for being here. Thank you all.
