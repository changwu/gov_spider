    NEW YORK - Bernie Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver on Friday issued the following statement after Secretary Hillary Clinton accused Sanders' campaign of "lying" about the donations she receives from the fossil fuel industry:
"It is disappointing that Secretary Clinton has leveled an accusation that just isn't true. It's very clear from research done by Greenpeace that she's not just receiving money from 'individuals' who happen to work in the oil, coal and gas industry. Fifty-seven lobbyists from the industry have personally given to her campaign and 11 of those lobbyists have bundled more than $1 million to help put her in the White House. If you include money given to super PACs backing Clinton, the fossil fuel industry has given more than $4.5 million in support of Clinton's bid.
"Bernie believes it is critical that the next president acts to curb the worst effects of climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels. He also believes you cannot take on an industry if you take their money. If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine. But to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary's fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing."
