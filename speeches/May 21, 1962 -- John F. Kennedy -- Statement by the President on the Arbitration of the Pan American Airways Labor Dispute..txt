    THE ARBITRATION award handed down today in the dispute between Pan American World Airways and the Air Line Pilots Association is a concrete step toward settlement of the difficult problems which have plagued the airline industry for several years.
The parties are to be commended for seeking a solution to their differences through voluntary arbitration, thus benefiting the employees and carriers involved and the public by averting a shutdown in operations of a vital section of the industry.
I wish especially to commend and thank the outstanding members of the arbitration panel--Dr. George W. Taylor, its chairman, and Edgar F. Kaiser and George Meany-for their willingness to devote their talent, time, and effort to this important assignment. They have performed a valuable public service.
