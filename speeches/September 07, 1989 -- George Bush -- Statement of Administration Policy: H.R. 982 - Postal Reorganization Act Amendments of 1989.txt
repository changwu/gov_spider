    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Leland (D) Texas and 366 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 982, because it does not include reforms and budgetary savings provided for in the Bi-Partisan Budget Agreement as a condition of removing the Postal Service from the budget. The Administration would not oppose a bill taking the Postal Service off-budget if it includes the requisite reforms and savings.
