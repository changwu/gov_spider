"I've seen the flooding that you've had here. In the west, where I live, the fire seasons are 78 days days longer than they were 30 years ago. We have to address climate change and we have to do it not just for today, but for our kids and grandkids."
"I think we can take immediate and durable action. Pulling out of the overall international climate accords, that really sets us back. Not even the auto industry wanted these emissions standards removed."
