    I congratulate President Giorgio Napolitano on his reelection as President of Italy. For 7 years, President Napolitano has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in Italy, in Europe, and around the world. I admire his decision to, once again, serve the Italian people as President and welcome the decision that the Italian Parliament has made to come together to select him for continued service.
President Napolitano's steadfast commitment to the alliance between the United States and Italy is deep and abiding and reflects the enduring bonds among our people. His continued stewardship of the transatlantic relationship will ensure that we move forward together in facing the challenges of our times.
