    Dear Bill:
This is to advise you that I expect to appear personally to respond to the questions raised in House Resolutions 1367 and 1370.
It would be my desire to arrange this hearing before your Subcommittee at a mutually convenient time within the next ten days.
Thank you for your help and assistance in this matter.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
