    Momentum in key early voting states builds as voters learn of Richardson's unparalleled experience and hear his vision for America
SANTA FE, NM - A new poll by the Des Moines Register published today shows support in Iowa for Governor Bill Richardson has reached 10%, pulling him closer to the leaders in the race for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination. The new Iowa numbers come on the heels of the latest Zogby poll in New Hampshire which shows Governor Richardson's support there has also grown to 10%.
"Our strategy is simple and it's working," said Dave Contarino, Governor Richardson's campaign manager. "We have focused Governor's time and campaign resources in those early states to demonstrate that once people hear of Bill Richardson's extraordinary record and get to know him, support and the campaign's momentum would grow."
Bill Richardson has served 7 terms as a US Congressman, as US Ambassador to the United Nations, as Secretary of Energy, and is now in his second term as Governor of New Mexico.
"Bill Richardson is the most qualified and best prepared to be President and heal the divisions and take on the challenges facing this country today," added Contarino. "Our biggest hurdle is penetrating the media coverage that is mainly focused on the early poll leaders. When voters compare records and experience, Governor Richardson is clearly the top candidate."
The most recent Zogby poll in Iowa also showed Governor Richardson's support and momentum growing from 3% to 6%.
