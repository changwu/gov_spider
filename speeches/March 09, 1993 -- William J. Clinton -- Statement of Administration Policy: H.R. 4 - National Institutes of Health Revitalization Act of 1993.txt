    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Waxman (D) CA and 40 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4 as ordered reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 4 could result in increased receipts to the Federal Government due to provisions that would impose criminal fines against individuals not complying with certain prohibitions related to the sale, purchase, or donation of human fetal tissue. Therefore, H.R. 4 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
