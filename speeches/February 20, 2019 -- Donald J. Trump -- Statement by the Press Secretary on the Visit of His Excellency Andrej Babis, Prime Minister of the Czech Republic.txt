    President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will welcome Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Mrs. Monika Babisova of the Czech Republic for their first official visit to the White House on March 7, 2019. The President and the Prime Minister will discuss how best to advance relations between the United States and the Czech Republic and the need to confront together our shared global challenges, including cyber, energy security issues, and mutual trade concerns. The Prime Minister's visit will come on the 30th anniversary of the Czech Republic's "Velvet Revolution," which brought about the end of communist rule in their country, and the 20th anniversary of its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The President and First Lady look forward to commemorating these special anniversaries alongside Prime Minister Babis and Mrs. Babisova.
