VP Pool #1 — JBA/Pete Buttigieg 
Good morning,
Vice President Kamala Harris is headed to Charlotte, N.C., to tout the Biden administration’s bipartisan infrastructure law.
The VP will be joined by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom NPR’s Scott Detrow spotted waiting in the passenger terminal lounge this morning, and Rep. Alma Adams.
Detrow and then the pool also saw Buttigieg from the back boarding AF2 at about 8:40 a.m.
On Background from a White House Official. Embargoed until 9 a.m. 
On Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Vice President will discuss how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will benefit North Carolinians. This visit is a part of her continued efforts to advocate for the Administration’s policies that invest in our nation’s infrastructure, take climate action, and advance environmental justice. She will be joined by Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Congresswoman Alma Adams (D-NC-12).
While in Charlotte, the Vice President will receive a tour of the public transit facility at the Charlotte Area Transit System’s Bus Garage, meet with transit workers, and deliver remarks about how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will upgrade North Carolina’s infrastructure.
The trip builds on the Vice President’s work with President Biden and the Cabinet to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law through dozens of public events nationwide. This visit follows the Vice President’s trip to Columbus, OH on Nov. 19 with Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. The Vice President toured the Plumbers & Pipefitters Local Union #189, met with workers, and delivered remarks about how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will impact Ohioans.
Additional Background on BIL 

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will improve transportation options for millions of Americans and reduce greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. America’s public transit infrastructure is inadequate – with a multibillion-dollar repair backlog, representing more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement. Communities of color are twice as likely to take public transportation and many of these communities lack sufficient public transit options. The transportation sector in the United States is now the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation includes $39 billion of new investment to modernize transit, in addition to continuing the existing transit programs for five years as part of surface transportation reauthorization. In total, the new investments and reauthorization in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal provide $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years — the largest Federal investment in public transit in history. The legislation will expand public transit options across every state in the country, replace thousands of deficient transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles, and improve accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will deliver thousands of electric school buses nationwide, including in rural communities. This will help school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses and replace the yellow school bus fleet for America’s children. These investments will drive demand for American-made batteries and vehicles, creating jobs and supporting domestic manufacturing, while also removing diesel buses from some of our most vulnerable communities. In addition, they will help the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. As a Senator, Vice President Harris led the Clean School Bus Act, the first bill to focus exclusively on zero emission school buses. This legislation served as the foundation for the stand-alone school bus program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will invest $7.5 billion to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States. The deal is also a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. The deal will provide funding for deployment of EV chargers along highway corridors to facilitate long-distance travel and within communities to provide convenient charging where people live, work, and shop – and funding will have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.

VP Pool Report #4: Charlotte arrival/ Pete gaggle
AF2 touched down at 10:32 a.m.
Secretary Buttigieg and Rep. Adams came to the back of the plane and held what Symone Sanders billed as a "brief, but impactful" gaggle.
Buttigieg was asked about speculation over President Biden not running for re-election and general chatter about he and Harris mounting presidential campaigns of their own in 2024.
"It's 2021," Buttigieg said. "And the whole point of campaigns and elections is when they go well you get to govern. And we are squarely focused on the job at hand. I am excited to be part of a team led by the President and the Vice President and I think the teamwork that got us to this point is really just beginning."
Asked a follow up on the "teamwork" remark, and whether today's event represents a united front with VP Harris, Buttigieg stressed that he's proud to be part of the team.
"As transportation secretary, I get to be the face of a lot of these investments that we're doing, but we would not be here without the leadership of the Vice President as well as the President; of course, and so many others. So I am glad we're able to shine a light on that today."

VP Pool #6 — Harris, Buttigieg bus depot tour
Harris, Buttigieg and others including the governor began a quick tour of a Charlotte bus depot about 11:20 a.m.
The facility is near South End, and two busses were parked in a garage with space in between for officials to gather. Harris asked a transit official what they could tell her about an all-electric bus.
"So how does it feel to drive it," she probed a driver, nodding as the woman spoke. "Oh, that's very user-friendly," Harris responded when the woman ticked off some features. Harris clasped her hands and then mimicked driving. "You just tap it," she repeated the bus driver about using the breaks. "Whereas before you really had to push it," Harris added, again summing up what the woman said.
Harris spoke to a man who jumped into the bus and started it. Pool could hear a click. "So that's it getting revved up?" Harris asked. She kept peppering another operator with questions as Buttigieg looked on silently.
Harris asked to go inside. "It has that 'new bus' smell," Harris marveled. The group laughed.
Harris then climbed into the driver's seat and pretend to drive the electric bus, honking the horn. "The wheels on the bus go 'round and 'round," she said, letting out a big laugh.
The tour continues to a hybrid light-rail car.

VP Pool Report #10 — VP Harris gaggle
Harris gaggled with the pool outside AF2 and took two questions.
Asked about Symone Sanders' coming departure, Harris said "I love Symone," and talked about their work together.
"I can't wait to see what she will do next. I know that it's been three years jumping on and off planes going around the country … and I mean that sincerely."
Harris declined to answer a follow up about whether she's in the midst of a staff standup or if she views this as a reset for the VP's office.
She also critiqued Republicans by saying vaccine mandates shouldn't be partisan.
Harris boarded AF2 about 2:05 p.m.
Some fuller quotes to come.
Buttigieg is returning to Washington on AF2 and Rep. Adams is remaining in Charlotte.

VP Pool Report #11 — DCA arrival 
On the plane, VP Harris aides huddled behind a drawn curtain, where Harris sang happy birthday to Juan Ortega, a top advance staffer. This is one of her things, singing happy birthday, both in person and over the phone.
They ate cupcakes, which were shared with the pool after the private AF2 celebration.
Harris stepped off the plane around 3:25 p.m.
Thanks, all,
