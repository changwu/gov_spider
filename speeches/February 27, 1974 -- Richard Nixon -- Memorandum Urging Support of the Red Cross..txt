    Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Red Cross Month is a time for every American to reflect upon the vital role the Red Cross and its volunteers play to alleviate suffering and to meet a vast spectrum of human needs in our society. Through the Red Cross, we donate blood to help cure the ill and injured, we arm ourselves with the knowledge and skills to save lives by learning first aid, water safety and the handling of small craft, we assist members of our Armed Forces the world over and veterans and their families, and we give a helping hand to those left destitute by disasters.
In proclaiming March as Red Cross Month, I ask that the Federal Government and its employees, including members of the Armed Forces, give their fullest support to this essential organization, which stands constantly ready to be of service wherever it is needed.
