    Independence, IA - On the fourth day of her "Every County Counts" Tour, Hillary is traveling to Independence, Elkader, Clarion and Des Moines.
Throughout the day, Hillary has focused on her efforts to change the health care system and expand coverage to all Americans. For decades Hillary has been fighting to improve access to quality, affordable insurance for every American, back to her days as First Lady of Arkansas when she worked to improve rural health care in underserved areas.
Listen to excerpts from today's speech in Independence, IA.
"People feel like nobody is paying attention to the concerns they have, to the needs they are trying to meet. And I know we can do better than that. That's why I got into public service long before I ran for public office. That's what motivates me, that's what keeps me going. Some people have different reasons and that's perfectly fine but that's not who I am. What I care about is helping people solve the problems and challenges they face and helping our country do the same."

"One of the most significant needs that Americans now face is getting quality, affordable health care that is always there, that never disappears when you lose or change jobs, that isn't in the control of health insurance companies that tell doctors and nurses and hospitals what they can or can't do, but instead is a commitment so that every single person and family knows they will have the health care they deserve and need."
