More Than 50 Georgia Legislators Supporting Romney
Boston, MA â€“ Today Governor Mitt Romney announced nearly two dozen additions to the Romney for President Georgia Legislative Leadership Team. These Georgia leaders will help organize grassroots efforts across the state and will help communicate Governor Romney's message of conservative change in Washington.
Announcing the additions to the Georgia Legislative Leadership Team, Governor Mitt Romney said, "I am proud to have the support of these Georgia leaders. With the Georgia primary just days away, their leadership and hard work are critical to our campaign across the state. We have built an exceptional team and continue to gain momentum. We expect to be very competitive in Georgia. I look forward to working with this team to victory on Tuesday."
U.S. Representative Jack Kingston said, "Today's announcement shows the growing support and momentum for Governor Mitt Romney in Georgia. Voters in Georgia have a choice on Tuesday, and they are increasingly running towards Governor Romney because of his strong leadership background and overwhelming understanding of the economy. We are proud to give Mitt Romney our full support."
Romney for President Campaign State Co-Chair, Speaker Pro Tempore Mark Burkhalter said, "Governor Romney is gaining ground in Georgia every day because he is the only candidate in this race who has the skills, experience and vision to change Washington. Governor Romney's message of a stronger economy, stronger military and stronger families is resonating with voters across Georgia. We will continue to work hard toward victory on Tuesday."
These legislators join U.S. Congressmen Tom Price, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston, House Speaker Pro Tempore Burkhalter, State Senate President Pro Tempore Eric Johnson, Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Dan Moody and dozens of their colleagues from the Georgia General Assembly in supporting Governor Romney.
