    At the Vermeer Corporation headquarters in Pella, Iowa, Newt answers questions about education, jobs, taxes, regulation, trade agreements, energy policy and other issues facing the business and manufacturing industry.

According to the Des Moines Register, Newt received the most applause of any of the presidential candidates.
Newt Gingrich got the most applause from the audience full of business leaders at this morning's presidential candidates' forum sponsored by the National Association of Manufacturers.
There was enthusiastic clapping when Gingrich said he would educate Congress on how legislation needs to be longer term rather than lasting just a year. Several business executives said later they appreciated Gingrich's thoughts on how to improve worker training for the jobless. He said the 99 weeks a worker collects unemployment is equal to the time it takes to earn an associate's degree.
"Of this group, I think Newt Gingrich is the most qualified intellectually to take this country the furthest," said Al Jennings, chairman and CEO of EFCO Corp. in Des Moines. "But keep in mind that we didn't hear from all the candidates, and that's disappointing."

Meanwhile, The Iowa Republican said Newt had a "terrific performance" and declared him the winner of the event.
Newt Gingrich: He has shined in all the debates and most forums and this was no different. Prior to the broadcast, the live audience was asked to hold their applause. However, they clapped for Gingrich's answers three times and laughed a few other times. The former House speaker's command of the issues, combined with the ability to verbalize that knowledge, is unmatched anywhere in U.S. politics.

Overall Winner: Newt Gingrich received the best response from the audience, so I give him the slight edge. However, I thought the other four participants handled themselves well.
