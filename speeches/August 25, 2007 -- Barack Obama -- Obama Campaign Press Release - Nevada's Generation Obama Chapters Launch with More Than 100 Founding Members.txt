    Las Vegas, NV -- The Obama campaign announced today that the Nevada chapters of "Generation Obama" or "GO" are launching their newest outreach program to young professionals and young voters with 116 founding members. With the goal of channeling the excitement and energy of the hundreds of young supporters across the state, Obama's campaign is kicking off their Generation Obama chapters with events today in Las Vegas and Reno.
"This is just a starting point for Nevada's Generation Obama. As GO continues to network and expand, the number of young people who become a part of this movement will keep growing. But what a starting point," said Gabriel Shepherd, one of the volunteer group leaders for the Las Vegas GO chapter.
While concentrated in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada's GO members are spread across the state, and each brings with them their own networks of friends and colleagues. GO's ability to mobilize and engage new voters stems from the unprecedented number of young people who want to reach out to their networks - social and professional - to spread Obama's message of change in the final push before the January 19th caucuses.
Barack Obama has generated an amazing level of support and enthusiasm among young people nationally and in Nevada, and the Generation Obama chapters in both Las Vegas and Reno will help direct this energy into real action. The 116 founding GO members are actively involved in the Obama campaign's larger organization, where they serve as volunteers, precinct captains, local organizers and grassroots fundraisers. Working with the Obama campaign staff, GO will design and implement specific programs to reach young people across the state, as well as build on existing young professionals networks to raise money and support.
The events today will serve as the kick off for the fall youth organizing campaign headed into the January 19th caucuses.
