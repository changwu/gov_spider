    In response to the last night of the Republican Convention and its failure to propose clear policies to help Latino families, Biden for President Latino Media Director Jennifer Molina released the following statement:
"Instead of offering solutions to struggling Latino families, Republicans spent the week pushing out fantasy, false rhetoric, name calling and empty gestures. All week long we have been given an inside look into the alternate universe that Donald Trump lives in. This is all smoke and mirrors to try to distract from all the damage he has done to our community.
The Latino community is in crisis thanks to the Trump Administration. As a result of Trump's failed pandemic response, our community is facing the highest rates of COVID infection, unprecedented job losses, shuttered small businesses and closed schools. This is on top of four years of attacks on DACA recipients, constant attempts to undermine our access to healthcare and an economic agenda that only works for the wealthy.
The Trump presidency was a disaster for Latinos before COVID. We are now in crisis.
This is why we need new leadership focused on solutions for the challenges facing Latino families. A Biden-Harris Administration will lead with science and facts to get COVID-19 under control and stabilize our communities. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a plan to build back better so that the post-COVID economic recovery includes Latino families and provides our community an opportunity to succeed. A Biden-Harris Administration will restore American values and will ensure our immigration system is rooted in fairness, inclusion and opportunity, not rooted in fear and misinformation."
