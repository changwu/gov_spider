WH pool report 7 -- final quotes
On Russia helping Sanders:
"I have not been briefed on that at all. Nobody told me about it. They leaked it -- Adam Schiff and his group, they leaked it to the papers as usual. They ought to investigate Adam Schiff for leaking that information. He should not be leaking information out of intelligence. They ought to investigate Adam Schiff."
"What it could be is you know the Democrats are treating Bernie Sanders very unfairly and it sounds to me like a leak from Adam Schiff because they don't want Bernie Sanders to represent them. It sounds like it's '16 all over again for Bernie Sanders.
"He had a great victory yesterday, but you know what happneing, you can see the handwriting on the wall."
On Ukraine and Russia:
"I'd like to see them come together. If they came together in the sense that they got along with each other, that would be a great thing for the world."
On Roger Stone:
"I've seen a very sad thing going oin with respect to roger stone. yo hsvr a jurur thats obviously tainted.

"That shouldn't happen in our criminal justice system."
Trump schedule:
After India, rally in South Carolina on Thursday and the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday. "Not a lot of time for rest."
Will Bernie Sanders be the Democratic nominee?
"I think so, unless they cheat him out of it....Bernie is looking more and more like he'll be the nominee unless they cheat him out of it. A lot of people thought he was going to be nominee last time but it didn't work out. I think they're watching it very closely."
Coronavirus:
"We're very much involved, we're very cognizant of everything going on. We have it very much under control in this country."
U.S. had 12 victims at one pointy but many have gotten very much better.
"It's a big problem but President Xi loves his country. He's working very hard to solve the problem and he will solve the problem."
On the new intelligence director:
"This is just a temporary job. We have five people that we're looking at very seriously, expert people, and at a certain point in the not to distant future, we'll be announcing who they are."
On the championship fight:
Trump said he watched the WBC heavyweight champion fight between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, which Fury won. "That was a great fight."
