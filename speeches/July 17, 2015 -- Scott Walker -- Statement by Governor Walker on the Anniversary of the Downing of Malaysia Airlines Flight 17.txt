    Davenport, IA -- Governor Scott Walker released the following comment on the anniversary of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 (MH-17) over eastern Ukraine:
"A year ago today, 298 civilians on board MH-17 were murdered, shot out of the sky by a Russian missile fired from territory illegally occupied by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.
"Russia has shown no remorse for causing this tragedy. Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin suggested Russia would block the establishment of a tribunal to prosecute those responsible for downing the plane, another effort to hide Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
"The tragedy of MH-17 wouldn't have happened had Russia not invaded Ukraine a year and a half ago. For that, Putin bears full responsibility. The United States cannot allow Putin's regime to go unpunished for this criminal act.
"If the U.S. continues the failed Obama-Clinton approach of sitting on the sidelines while our adversaries advance, we will further endanger our safety and that of our allies."
