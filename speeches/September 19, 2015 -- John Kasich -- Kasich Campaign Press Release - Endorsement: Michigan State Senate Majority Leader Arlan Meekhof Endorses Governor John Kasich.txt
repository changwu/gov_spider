Meekhof to serve as State Co-Chair of Michigan Kasich for America
Today on Mackinac Island, Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President. Meekhof will serve as a Michigan State Co-Chair for Kasich's campaign.
"Americans are tired of the gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, and now more than ever, they are looking for someone who can bring people together to get things done," said Sen. Meekhof. "John Kasich can do that, and we know that because he's done it before, both in Washington and in Ohio. Whether it was helping to balance the federal budget, filling an $8 billion budget deficit in Ohio, or creating an environment in Ohio that led to the creation of more than 300,000 private sector jobs, John Kasich has throughout his career shown the leadership necessary to accomplish great things. He's done it before, and he'll do it again."
Senator Meekhof was elected to the Michigan State Senate in 2010, and was voted Majority Leader by his Republican colleagues for his second term. Meekhof, prior to coming to the Senate, served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 2007 â€” 2010, and was named assistant leader in 2009. Before arriving in the state legislature, Sen. Meekhof served on the Olive Township Board of Trustees.
Said Kasich, "I couldn't be more proud than to have earned the endorsement of Senator Meekhof. Arlan Meekhof is an admired, respected legislator and a strong leader among his colleagues, and I am humbled by the confidence he has placed in my candidacy. Michigan is an incredibly important state, and with Senator Meekhof's counsel and experience, I know my campaign is going to be very competitive here."
