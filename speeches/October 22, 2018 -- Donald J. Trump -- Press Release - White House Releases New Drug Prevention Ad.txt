    Today, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), in partnership with the Ad Council and Truth Initiative, rolled out the second phase of the Administration's "The Truth About Opioids" drug prevention ads, targeted at young adults aged 18-24. The newly released ad, titled "Treatment Box," brings Americans face-to-face with opioid addiction. The ad captures 26-year-old Rebekkah's real experience as she undergoes evidence-based treatment for opioid addiction.
"We are all indebted to Rebekkah for her bravery in sharing her experience with the goal of helping other people," said ONDCP Deputy Director James Carroll. "We're releasing this second campaign during Prevention Month to continue our focus on addressing the knowledge gap on opioid use so we can turn the tide on this crisis and save lives."
Background: The "Truth About Opioids" is a compelling, multi-channel public education campaign that is reaching youth and young adults ages 18-24 through digital platforms, social media and television. Launched in June 2018 from ONDCP, the Ad Council and Truth Initiative, it focuses on preventing and reducing the misuse of opioids among youth and young adults. The campaign's website, opioids.thetruth.com, includes information about opioids, the epidemic and a treatment locator resource powered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
