    The United States welcomes the significant steps undertaken by the Government of South Africa over the past several weeks to restore market access for U.S. poultry, pork, and beef products. We appreciate the strong collaboration between U.S. and South African trade and health experts to address outstanding concerns. As a result of this work and the Administration's relentless commitment to holding our trading partners accountable, South Africa has met all of the benchmarks to remain eligible for African Growth and Opportunity Act benefits, and today the President issued a proclamation revoking the impending suspension of these benefits on March 15.
The United States and South Africa share a mutual interest in strong and equitable economic growth and opportunities for all our citizens. We look forward to continuing to work closely with South Africa to further enhance our trade and investment relationship.
