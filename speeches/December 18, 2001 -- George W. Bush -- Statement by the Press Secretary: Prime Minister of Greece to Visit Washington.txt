    President Bush will welcome Greek Prime Minister Constantine Simitis to Washington on January 10, 2002. This visit provides an opportunity to deepen cooperation between the United States and Greece, key NATO allies, on stability in the Balkans, Cyprus, NATO and the European Union, counterterrorism, and preparations for the upcoming Olympics in Salt Lake City and Athens. The visit will also serve as a reminder of the great and enduring contributions that Greek Americans have made to the United States and to American society.
