FALMOUTH, Maine — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was endorsed today by Maine State Representative Aaron Libby (R-Waterboro). Representing the 139th District, Rep. Libby serves an area comprised of Waterboro and part of Lyman.
At a town hall event featuring Ron Paul in Alfred, Rep. Libby made his endorsement public before the crowd of Paul supporters.
"We need to change our cradle-to-grave government mentality.  Cutting taxes is not enough.  We must reduce the size and cost of our federal government.  I am tired of the status quo, big-government politicians of both sides of the aisle.  Ron Paul represents real cuts, real change, for a free and prosperous America.  I am a Ron Paul Republican," said Rep. Libby.
Currently in his first term, Rep. Libby was a delegate to the 2008 state Republican convention and coordinates Ron Paul campaign efforts for York County. One of 10 young apple farmers selected by the U.S. Apple Association for "Capitol Hill Day," he attempted to meet several Representatives, but found only Dr. Paul to take genuine interest in his agricultural issues when the meeting occurred. That was the day Dr. Ron Paul inspired him to make his successful run for the Maine State Legislature.
Providing a strong conclusion to Ron Paul's two-day Maine swing, such endorsements help present Ron Paul as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney and flex the might of the only other campaign organization capable of maintaining a 50-state competition with the establishment candidate.
