    This week, Biden for President is launching ads targeting voters in Indian Country, rolling out digital, radio, and print ads to engage persuadable voters, and mobilize members of Tribal communities to support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The ads — the first ever placed by a presidential campaign in at least one Tribal outlet — allow the campaign to reach voters in Indian Country, especially those who the campaign may not be able to reach through traditional voter outreach efforts.
The paid media campaign highlights the Biden-Harris plan for Tribal Nations, and Joe Biden's commitment to make far-reaching investments to build back better across Indian Country in health care, education, economic opportunities and community development. The ads also recognize how Indian Country has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and encourage voters in Indian Country to vote early, urging them to make a plan by visiting iwillvote.com.
And new radio spots, featuring Native American narrators, outline how Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are committed to upholding the U.S.'s trust and responsibility to tribal nations, and strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. In one radio ad targeting the Navajo Nation, Biden for President Tribal Engagement Director Clara Pratte says, "Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will...work to empower our tribal nation to govern itself, for our communities to make our own decisions."
The ads will run on platforms in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. The campaign's paid media program is active in a total of 16 states — including the above states in addition to Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.
