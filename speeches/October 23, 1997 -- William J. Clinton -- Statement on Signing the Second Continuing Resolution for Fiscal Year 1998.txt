    I am pleased to have signed into law today House Joint Resolution 97, the second shortterm continuing resolution for fiscal year 1998.
The resolution provides 1998 appropriations for continuing projects and activities of the Federal Government through November 7, 1997, except those funded by the five bills that I have already signed into law.
I urge the Congress to approve the remaining 1998 spending bills that include the items contained in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and to provide funding for other priority programs. To give the Congress time to adopt such bills, I have approved this second continuing resolution.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House,
October 23, 1997.
