    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and 63 others)
The United States was a principal co-sponsor of and strongly supports United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 46/215, which was adopted on December 20, 1991. The Resolution calls for a world-wide moratorium on high seas large-scale driftnet fishing by December 31, 1992. The Administration has aggressively sought to ensure that the moratorium goes into effect by December 31, 1992, and will continue to do so. It has, in the interim, negotiated agreements with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan to monitor and control their high seas driftnet fishing in the North Pacific.
The Administration fully supports the goal of H.R. 2152 â€” limiting driftnet fishing. The Administration, however, opposes the bill, because it fails to give the Administration flexibility in enforcing the Resolution in a way that will maximize American interests, consistent with the Resolution. H.R. 2152 is not the proper instrument to implement the moratorium on high seas driftnet fishing.
H.R. 2152 is also objectionable because certain provisions could be construed to encroach upon the President's, authority under the Constitution to conduct foreign relations.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) requires that all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in an increase in the deficit; and if it does, it must trigger a sequester if it is not fully offset. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would result in a net zero PAYGO effect. Thus, considered alone, this bill meets the PAYGO requirement of OBRA.
