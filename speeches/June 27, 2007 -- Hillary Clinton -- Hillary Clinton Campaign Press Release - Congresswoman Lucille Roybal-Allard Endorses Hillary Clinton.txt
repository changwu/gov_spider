    The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of California Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, illustrating the growing support she has in the Golden State.
"Hillary Clinton is the candidate with the experience and strength to lead our nation in a new direction," said Roybal-Allard. "I have witnessed first hand her commitment to reach out to people from diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, and bring them together toward a common goal. We need her kind of leadership in the White House."
Congresswoman Roybal-Allard is a political pioneer, who became the first Mexican-American woman elected to Congress in 1992. Before that, she represented the 56th Assembly District of California for six years. Roybal-Allard has made public health issues a priority during her congressional tenure, building on the legacy of her late father, Congressman Edward Roybal, who was a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and represented his Los Angeles district for 30 years.
Known as a respected consensus builder, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard served as chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation in 1997 and 1998. In assuming this position, she became the first Member to achieve this role through election rather than seniority, as well as the first woman and Latina chair. Later, during the 106th Congress in 1999 and 2000, she went on to also become the first woman to chair the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. She currently serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
"I am honored to have the support of Congresswoman Roybal-Allard," said Hillary Clinton. "She has been a trail blazer whose commitment to expanding opportunities for residents of her district is making a difference for working families in California."
