    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1702), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code,
I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, find that the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and of the means of delivering such weapons, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
Accordingly, in light of the revocation of Executive Order No. 12730 of September 30, 1990, and in order to limit the participation by United States persons in weapons proliferation activities, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized and directed to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as may be necessary to continue to regulate the activities of United States persons in order to prevent their participation in activities that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery, as provided in the Export Administration Regulations, set forth at 15 Cfr sections 768-799 (1993).
Sec. 2. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore or hereafter under the authority of the Export Administration Act, or the authorities provided under Executive Order No. 12730 of September 30, 1990, and Executive Order No. 12735 of November 16, 1990.
Sec. 3. This order shall take effect immediately.
William J. Clinton
The White House,
September 30, 1993.
