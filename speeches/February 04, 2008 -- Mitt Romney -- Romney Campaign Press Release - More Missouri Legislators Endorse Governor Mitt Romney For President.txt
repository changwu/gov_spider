Boston, MA - Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that four more Missouri State Legislators have endorsed his campaign for President of the United States. Senator Tom Dempsey, Representative Bob Onder, Representative Shane Schoeller, and Representative Joe Smith will help expand Governor Romney's grassroots campaign in Missouri and will help communicate Governor Romney's message of conservative change in Washington.
"I am proud to announce the addition of these distinguished leaders to our strong and growing grassroots team in Missouri," said Governor Romney. "Washington is broken, and we aren't going to fix it by sending the same people back just to have them sit in different chairs. With the help of these legislators, I'll work to earn the support of as many Missourians as possible."
These legislators join a strong Missouri team that includes Governor Matt Blunt, Speaker of the House Rod Jetton, and several other Missouri legislators.
