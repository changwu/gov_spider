Trump commends Mexico for its leadership in co-convening the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America with the United States in Miami, Florida from June 15 to 16.

The United States views the security and prosperity of Central America as key to regional stability and to the security of the United States. We affirm our strong partnership with Central America and the region in supporting our mutual priorities. The President applauds this conference and the efforts of our Central American and regional partners to work toward a future that achieves stability, security, prosperity, and growth in the Western Hemisphere.

The President remains greatly concerned about the situation faced by the Venezuelan people and has instructed Secretary Tillerson to collaborate with countries in the region to move discussions on Venezuela forward during this important meeting. The United States stands with the people of Venezuela during these sad and troubling times for their country.
