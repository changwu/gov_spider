    Today, Julio Fuentes, member of the Romney Education Policy Advisory Group and President and CEO of Hispanic Council for Reform and Educational Options made the following statement on the strike by the Chicago Teachers Union:
"The Chicago teachers strike is just yet another example of President Obama refusing to lead on matters of pressing concern to our nation. As Mayor Emanuel has said, this is a 'strike of choice' that is 'avoidable' and 'wrong.' It's unfortunate that the President can't put aside his allegiance to organized labor and be the leader America's students deserve."
