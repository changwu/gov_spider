    Florida Congressman Tom Rooney issued the following statement on tonight's Orlando debate:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by laying out his pro-growth economic plan and displaying why he is ready to be president on day one. President Obama's policies have failed Florida – unemployment is now at 10.7% and is much higher in parts of the state. Mitt Romney has the experience working in the real economy that will be needed to get Florida and our country on the right track – he isn't another career politician. Floridians are also looking for the candidate who will fix Social Security for future generations, not a candidate who has pledged to dismantle it and possibly put our seniors' retirement in question."
