Sanders was introduced at the University of Pittsburgh rally by U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, one of 10 states scheduled to hold primaries in May and June. Sanders has pledged to carry his campaign through to Oregon, California and all of the remaining states still slated to vote.
"From coast to coast people are standing up, they are fighting back and they are saying that we need a government that works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors," Sanders told more than 800 supporters at the Fitzgerald Field House.
Sanders spoke about reforming trade policies that have driven manufacturing jobs from this city's once booming steel mills to low-wage nations overseas. He called for criminal justice reform to end the United States' dubious distinction of holding more people in prisons than any other nation on earth. He said immigration laws must be changed to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people living in the United States.

The senator from Vermont was scheduled to appear Monday night at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
"If there is a high voter turnout we are going to win here in Pennsylvania. Let's have the largest voter turnout in Pennsylvania history."
