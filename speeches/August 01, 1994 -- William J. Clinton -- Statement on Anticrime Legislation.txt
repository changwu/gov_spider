    Every major law enforcement organization in America supports this crime bill. Republican mayors have written members of their party in Congress to urge swift passage of the bill and Democratic mayors have done the same.
Today, the Nation's prosecutors have come to Washington to add their voices to this mighty chorus with its simple message: Pass the crime bill now.
Police officers want it because it bans the deadly assault weapons that outgun them every day. Mayors want it because it will put 100,000 more police officers on the streets. Prosecutors want it because it's full of tough punishments that will allow them to seek the penalties violent criminals deserve.
The American people want action against the crime and violence that has become a familiar threat in almost every neighborhood.
It's time for the lawmakers to do what the law enforcers have asked: Pass the crime bill now.
