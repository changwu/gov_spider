Rising star conservative and Tea Party activist Andrew Hemingway has been hired by Newt Gingrich's campaign to direct his ground game in New Hampshire.
Hemingway, who chairs the Republican Liberty Caucus of New Hampshire, is the first paid Gingrich staffer on the ground in the state. Others are expected to follow.
Under Hemingway's direction, the liberty caucus helped elect more than 100 new House members last year.
He is also the founder and CEO of Digital Acumen, a digital consulting firm, which had a leading role in the first-ever Twitter presidential debate earlier this year.
Hemingway and Gingrich met last spring when Gingrich hosted Tea Party activists in Dover.
He'll work with Michelle McManus of Bow, a volunteer grass-roots leader heading Gingrich's "Team 10" project.
We've also learned Gingrich will return to the state Oct. 25 and 26. One of his stops will be to file his candidacy in the New Hampshire Primary at the secretary of state's office.
The Gingrich camp says the Hemingway hiring comes as Gingrich gains momentum.
"We have raised more money in the past four days than we did in all of July," said spokesman R.C. Hammond.
