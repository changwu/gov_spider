Visa overstays are a widespread problem that harm the integrity of our immigration system.
As of March 2019, there were over 415,000 individuals in the United States suspected to still be in the United States after overstaying their nonimmigrant visas in fiscal year (FY) 2018.
Twenty countries have overstay rates of more than 10 percentâ€”some with rates as high as 20, 30, or 40 percent.
Countries not part of the Visa Waiver Program accounted for more than 300,000 total overstays in FY 2018.
The large number of aliens overstaying their period of lawful admission places a significant strain on our law enforcement and immigration officials who are needed to address the ongoing border crisis.

Under President Trump's leadership, DHS efforts led to a decrease in visa overstays from FY 2017 to FY 2018.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is using advanced biometrics at border crossings to confirm traveler identities and identify overstays.
DHS has worked to strengthen the integrity of the Visa Waiver Program by notifying travelers who have overstayed their visas and informing them of the consequences for not complying.
