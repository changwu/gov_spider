The event opened with live mariachi music and featured presentations by State Senator Paula Sandoval, DNC member Mannie Rodriquez and Adams County Assessor Gil Reyes.
"Hillary Clinton has a long record of delivering change and creating opportunity. She has been a strong advocate and longtime friend of the Hispanic community.
