Print pool report #1: Checking in
Greetings from the White House. I will be your print pooler for the day.
There’s not a lot on the schedule this afternoon.
Jen Psaki’s daily briefing is scheduled for 3 p.m. POTUS meets with top military leaders in the Cabinet Room at 4 p.m. There will be a pool spray at the top of that meeting.
At 5:30 p.m., the president and the first lady will host a dinner for military leaders and their spouses. The dinner is closed press.
I’ll let you know if there are any changes to the schedule.
Shoot me a message if you have any questions.

On Ukraine: "I don't know about you, but I've been to Ukraine a number of times. I've spoken with them a lot. I was deeply involved. And I knew they were tough and proud. But I can tell you what, they are tougher and more proud than I thought."
