    WASHINGTON, DC - Today the RNC and Fox Business will decide and announce which candidates are on the main stage for this week's Republican Presidential debate. The criteria for participation includes placing in the top six in recent polls.
Multiple national polls including CNN, CBS, Fox, Marist and others have him in 5th or 6th place, one had him just a single point out of 4th. In multiple polls he scores ahead of Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, John Kasich and Carly Fiorina. In yesterday's Marist Iowa poll he was alone in 5th place.
By any reasonable criteria Senator Paul has a top-tier campaign and has qualified for the stage.
"This race is hitting its final stretch and Rand Paul is a serious contender for the nomination. He expects to be on the stage this week because he has qualified to do so and because he has a top tier campaign. He is on the ballot in every state. He has over 1000 precinct captains in Iowa and a huge 500 person leadership team in New Hampshire," said Doug Stafford, Chief Strategist.
