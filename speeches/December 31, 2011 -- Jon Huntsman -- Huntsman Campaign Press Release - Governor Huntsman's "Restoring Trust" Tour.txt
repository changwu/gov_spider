    Governor Huntsman understands that he needs to earn New Hampshire's vote, and nobody's working harder for it. This week the governor kicked off a 14-day "Restoring Trust" tour and made his 130th campaign stop in the Granite State. By Tuesday, he will eclipse 150 - twice as many as any other candidate.
Momentum is building. From Pelham to Franklin, growing crowds are coming to listen to the governor discuss his vision for rebuilding our economy and restoring trust in our government. For example, it was just a few months ago that Governor Huntsman drew a crowd of ten people at an event in Wolfeboro. Thursday night he returned to Mitt Romney's backyard, and held an electrifying town hall best summed up by this picture:

Our campaign's growing momentum shouldn't be surprising. On Wednesday, a USA Today/Gallup poll showed that of all the candidates running for president in 2012 — Republican or Democrat — Americans are more closely ideologically aligned with Governor Huntsman than any other.
Combined with the governor's international experience and impeccable economic credentials, and it's easy to see why some of the state's leading newspapers, such as the Concord Monitor, Keene Sentinel, Valley News and Monadnock Ledger, have all backed Governor Huntsman.
