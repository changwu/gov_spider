    Helena, MT — After House Democrats announced that they would begin formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"If the President of the United States used the power of his office to extort a foreign leader into investigating a political opponent, Congress has a responsibility to get answers," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "If the President abused his office and jeopardized American national security for his own personal gain, then the House needs to impeach him. At some point, this is bigger than Donald Trump — this is about a 243-year experiment called representative Democracy."
