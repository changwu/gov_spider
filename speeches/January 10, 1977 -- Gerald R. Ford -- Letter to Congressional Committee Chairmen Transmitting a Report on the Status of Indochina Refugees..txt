    IN ACCORDANCE with the provisions of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, I am reporting to you on the status of refugees from Cambodia and South Vietnam.
As my report to you shows, we continue to make substantial progress in the resettlement and assimilation of the Indochina refugee into American life. During the past quarter our attention has been focused particularly on the development of marketable job skills and English language proficiency for the resettled refugee. At the same time, however, we have brought into the United States almost all the remaining refugees authorized under the extended parole program. These new refugees will require our special attention and assistance.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the voluntary agencies, the public and private institutions and the many individual families that have contributed so generously to this program. Their support has aided these newcomers to our country and, through them, all our society.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
