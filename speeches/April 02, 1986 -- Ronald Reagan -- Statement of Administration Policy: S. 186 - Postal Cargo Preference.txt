    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Inouye (D) Hawaii)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of S. 186, because it would expand cargo preference requirements. The bill is highly anticompetitive in character, could increase costs to American consumers, and would unnecessarily and arbitrarily interfere with the ability of the United States Postal Service to manage the mails in an efficient and effective manner. Enactment of S. 186 would not be in accord with the program of the President.
