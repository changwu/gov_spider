    President Carter hosted a dinner this evening for President Giscard d'Estaing, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and high officials accompanying him. This was the French President's first visit to the White House in the Carter administration. The two Presidents last met in Paris in January.
During this informal dinner, President Giscard d'Estaing outlined the proposals he made this week at the U.N. Special Session on Disarmament. The two Presidents also discussed a wide range of international issues affecting their two countries, including East-West relations, the forthcoming seven-nation summit in Bonn this July, and the Middle East. They expressed their common concern about recent developments in Africa and agreed that concerted action with the African countries is necessary to promote security and development in that continent.
Both Presidents welcomed this chance to renew their friendship. The talks were conducted in an atmosphere of personal warmth and mutual understanding. They also reaffirmed the close ties between France and the United States, which this year are celebrating the 200th anniversary of their alliance.
