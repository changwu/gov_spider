    To the Congress of the United States:
On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that Bulgaria is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This determination allowed for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status and certain United States Government financial programs for Bulgaria without the requirement of a waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated Report to Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Bulgaria. You will find that the report indicates continued Bulgarian compliance with U.S. and international standards in areas of emigration and human rights policy.
