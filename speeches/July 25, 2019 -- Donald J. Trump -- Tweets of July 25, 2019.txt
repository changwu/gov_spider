President Trump's Approval Rating on Economy is at 52% a 4 point jump. Fox Poll @foxandfriends Shouldn't this be at 100%? Best stock market economy and unemployment numbers ever!

We love our Law Enforcement Officers all around this great Country. What took place in NYC with water being tossed on NYPD officers was a total disgrace. It is time for @NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio to STAND UP for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well...Retweets: 31017Favorites: 147363

Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan L'fven for being unable to act. Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly! #FreeRockyRetweets: 55555Favorites: 234880

Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem! #FreeRockyRetweets: 98749Favorites: 335130
