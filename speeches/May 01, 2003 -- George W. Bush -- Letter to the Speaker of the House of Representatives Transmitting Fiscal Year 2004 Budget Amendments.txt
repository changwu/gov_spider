    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to the Administration's FY 2004 budget submission for the Department of Defense.
In total, these amendments would not affect the budgetary resources proposed in my FY 2004 Budget.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
