    The President today announced his intention to nominate Dr. Michael Trujillo, a physician who has spent his career working to better health care delivery to Native Americans across the country, as Director of the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services.
"Many Americans are without adequate health care, but access to care for our country's Native Americans has been particularly poor," the President said. "Dr. Trujillo has a well-earned reputation for working to change that situation, and I am confident he will work hard to improve the delivery of health care to Native Americans in our cities and reservations."
