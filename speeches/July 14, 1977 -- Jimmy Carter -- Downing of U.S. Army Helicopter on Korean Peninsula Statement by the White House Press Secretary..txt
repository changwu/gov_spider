    We have confirmation that a Chinook cargo helicopter with a crew of three is down north of the demarcation line in the Korean Peninsula. There are indications it was forced down by North Korean fire.
We are deeply concerned about this incident, and we are requesting a prompt explanation from North Korean authorities. Any penetration of North Korean air space that may have taken place would have been unintentional and regrettable. We do not know at this time the fate of the crew. We have requested that every consideration be given to them by North Korean authorities, and we have asked for their immediate return.
