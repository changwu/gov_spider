    Record-Breaking September Fuels Huge Haul
WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Tuesday announced it raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 from 1.4 million donations, fueled by a September haul that set a Bernie 2020 record for total amount raised and number of individual contributions in a single month.
"Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations – both in the primary and in the general," Sanders' Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. "Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution."
The final day of the third quarter was the second biggest fundraising day of the campaign. "Teacher" was the most common occupation of Sanders' third quarter donors, the three most common employers were Starbucks, Amazon, and Walmart, and the average donation was $18.07.
Since the campaign's February launch, Sanders has raised $61.5 million from a total of 3.3 million individual donations for an average contribution of just $19, and more than 99.9 percent have not maxed out and can give again.
The third quarter total announced Tuesday does not include an additional $2.6 million transferred from Sanders' other campaign accounts.
