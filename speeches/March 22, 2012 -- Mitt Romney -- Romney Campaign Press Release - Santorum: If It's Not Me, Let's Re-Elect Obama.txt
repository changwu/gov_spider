    "I am in this race to defeat Barack Obama and restore America's promise. I was disappointed to hear that Rick Santorum would rather have Barack Obama as president than a Republican. This election is more important than any one person. It is about the future of America. Any of the Republicans running would be better than President Obama and his record of failure." —Mitt Romney
Earlier Today, Senator Santorum Said "We Might As Well Stay With What We Have" — President Obama — If Santorum Himself Isn't The Nominee.
SANTORUM: "Republicans and conservatives were so worried about, you know, getting control back that we have to win. And so we have to nominate someone who, you know, can appeal to ... No! You win by giving people a choice. You win by giving people the opportunity to see a different vision for our country, not someone who's just going to be a little different than the person in there. If they're going to be a little different, we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk of what may be the etch-a-sketch candidate for the future." (Rick Santorum, Remarks in San Antonio, TX, 3/22/12)
