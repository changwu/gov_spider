    Alexandria, Virginia — February 17, 2016 — Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and Republican candidate for President, announced today that Congressman Andy Harris (MD-1) has endorsed him in his campaign for the presidency. As a Naval reservist and former commander of the Johns Hopkins Medical Naval Reserve Unit, Congressman Harris has a long history of serving his country and his state. As a doctor, military officer and Congressman, he understands the principles of leadership that we need in the White House.
"As a physician, veteran, Congressman, and member of the House Freedom Caucus, I am proud to endorse Dr. Carson," said Congressman Harris. "He will restore America to greatness - not as a punch line in a campaign, but as a belief in returning America to its Constitutional roots. What we saw in the debate last Saturday reminds us just how much we need someone thoughtful like Dr. Carson in the White House."
"I'm honored and humbled to have the support of Congressman Harris," said Dr. Carson. "Throughout his service both to Maryland and the country as a whole, Andy has exemplified the integrity I have sought to embody in my campaign. He is a true citizen-statesman, and I know that with his support and the faith of 'We the People,' we can begin to 'Heal, Inspire and Revive this great nation'."
