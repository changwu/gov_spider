    The United States condemns in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack in Grand-Bassam, Côte d'Ivoire. We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of those who have been killed in this heinous attack. Our thoughts and prayers also are with those who have been injured. We commend the bravery of the Ivoirian and French security personnel who responded to the situation and prevented even worse loss of life, and the Department of State continues to coordinate with partners on the ground to verify the safety of American citizens in Côte d'Ivoire. The United States stands with the Ivoirian people and will remain a steadfast partner to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire as it continues making extraordinary progress strengthening its governing and economic institutions. We are prepared to assist the Ivoirian government in the coming days as it investigates this tragic terrorist attack.
We will also continue partnering with regional governments and international partners to fight the terrorists who seek to undermine efforts by West African governments to build tolerant and inclusive societies, improve governance, and expand economic opportunity.
