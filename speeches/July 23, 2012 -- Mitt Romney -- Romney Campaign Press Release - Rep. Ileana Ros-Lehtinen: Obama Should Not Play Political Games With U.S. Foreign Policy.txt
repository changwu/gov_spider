    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on President Obama's failure to visit Israel during his first term:
"Next week, Mitt Romney is traveling to Israel for the fourth time. Meanwhile, Barack Obama has yet to visit Israel as President, even as he has found time to visit numerous other countries around the world, including in the Middle East. We can only speculate about why the President has failed to visit the capital of our closest ally in the region, but we don't need to speculate about the timing of the latest hint from the White House that President Obama will travel to Israel in his second term. It's politically inspired, coming as it does only days before Mitt Romney heads off to Jerusalem.Â  One should not play political games with U.S. foreign policy, particularly at a moment when the Middle East is a tinderbox."
