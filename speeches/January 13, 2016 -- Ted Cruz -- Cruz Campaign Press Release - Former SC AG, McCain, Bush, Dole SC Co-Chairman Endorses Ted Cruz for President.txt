    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, Former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon endorsed Ted Cruz for President. A two-term AG in the Palmetto State, Condon led in guaranteeing constitutional rights for victims of crime. He served as John McCain's South Carolina Co-Chair in 2008, George Bush's South Carolina Co-Chairman in 2000, and South Carolina Chairman for Bob Dole in 1996.
"Ted Cruz's fidelity to the Constitution and the rule of law makes him a welcome figure after eight years of Obama's lawlessness," said Condon. "No one has fought harder to protect the rights and freedoms of Americans than Ted Cruz. From Texas to Washington, in the courtroom and on the Senate floor, he has been the leading voice opposing Obama's unconstitutional executive orders, usurpation of legislative power, and selective enforcement of the law. With Ted Cruz as President, we will have someone in office who respects not only his constitutional authority but also the limitations of that power that guarantee our liberty. I am proud to support Cruz for President."
"I am honored to have Charlie's support," said Cruz. "He has been an incredibly strong warrior in the fight to uphold the law and protect our freedoms. He is an important and influential voice in a critical early state in this campaign. I look forward to having his help as we connect with South Carolina voters."
