    Chancellor Kohl called to give the President a thorough briefing on the first part of his trip to Poland and on developments in East Germany. The President congratulated the Chancellor on the Federal Republic's handling of the situation with respect to East Germany and promised the full cooperation of the United States. The Chancellor asked the President to tell the American people: "Without the United States, this day would not have been possible." The President and Chancellor Kohl agreed that these dramatic developments make the Malta meeting even more important and agreed to consult closely between now and the meeting. They agreed to talk again next week.
The call occurred at 3:29 p.m. c.s.t. and lasted approximately 18 minutes.
