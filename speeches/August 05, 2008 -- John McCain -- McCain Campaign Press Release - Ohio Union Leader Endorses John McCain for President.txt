    COLUMBUS, OH -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the endorsement of longtime Mahoning Valley labor leader Martin J. "Jack" O'Connell.
"The rising price of gas and troubling economic times facing working families in Northeast Ohio call for true leadership to get our economy moving again," O'Connell said. "John McCain's record of putting his country before any special interest or political party proves that he is the right person to take on this challenge. You always know where John McCain stands, and I support him because I know he will always stand on the side of America's workers."
Martin J. "Jack" O'Connell was the first non-steelworker to serve as president of the local AFL-CIO in the Mahoning Valley. Throughout his labor career, O'Connell served as Business Manager for the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 87 (now Local 396) for 17 years, and also worked as a regional representative for former Ohio Attorney General Lee Fisher, a Democrat. O'Connell has served on numerous boards and committees, including the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Corporation Member and the Western Reserve Building Trades Council.
