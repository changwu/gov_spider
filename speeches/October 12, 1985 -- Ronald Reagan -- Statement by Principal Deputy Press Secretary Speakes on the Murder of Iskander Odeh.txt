    The Santa Ana office of the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee was bombed October 11, killing the center's director, Mr. Iskander (Alex) Odeh. The administration deeply deplores this tragic event and condemns in the strongest possible terms the criminal use of violence and terrorism to achieve political ends. To think even for a moment that there exists a justification for such heinous acts does grave injustice to the principles of political freedom upon which this country was founded.
The President extends his sincere condolences to Mr. Odeh's widow Norma and his three small daughters, as well as to other members of the family. The President has instructed that appropriate Federal authorities provide the fullest possible support to the local police investigation now underway.
