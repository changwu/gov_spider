    The President. Hello, everybody. Well, I wanted to come by--and don't worry, I'm not singing. [Laughter] That's a pretty funny one, isn't it? [Laughter]
Audience member. The harmonica!
The President. I'm not playing the harmonica, either. [Laughter]
Audience member. Bowling!
The President. I'm not bowling. [Laughter]
I am here to do one, simple thing, and that is to publicly thank David Obey for his extraordinary service to our country. He has been there through thick and through thin, in the majority and the minority. He has consistently held to his values. He has been a passionate advocate for working men and women and making sure that everybody has got a fair shot in our society.
He has been guided by his conscience. He has been directed by a fierce intelligence and great courage. And so, you know, many of us have him to thank for the path that he has created as we entered into politics. Because of him, this is a better place, this country of ours. And he is continuing to do outstanding work each and every day, including partnering with me to help get a whole bunch of stuff done that needs to get done on behalf of the American people.
So, David, thank you.
