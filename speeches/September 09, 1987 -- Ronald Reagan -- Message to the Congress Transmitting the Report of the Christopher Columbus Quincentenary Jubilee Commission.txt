    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 98-375, Sec. 4(b), I am pleased to transmit to you the report of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission.
This Commission was created by the Congress to plan, encourage, coordinate, and conduct the Nation's observance of the 500th anniversary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World in 1492. P.L. 98-375 instructed the Commission to report to the Congress its recommendations for a comprehensive national program of commemorating the Quincentenary.
As you will see from this report, the Commission has executed its charge in a spirit that takes full account of the heroic and visionary character of Christopher Columbus and of the mingling of peoples, sharing of civilizations, and development of new nations that took place in the New World as a consequence of his achievement. The report establishes five themes that collectively embrace the broad significance of the observance; it proposes three national initiatives to create enduring programs of commemoration; it identifies worthy projects to be carried out by the Nation's cultural, educational, and civic organizations; and it outlines a program of celebratory activities that will make participation in Quincentenary events possible for citizens and communities throughout the Nation.
The report provides the means of funding this comprehensive national program through proceeds from the sale of commemorative coins and through donated funds and services from private citizens and organizations.
