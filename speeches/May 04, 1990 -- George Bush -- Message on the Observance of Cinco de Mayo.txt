    I am pleased to send my warmest greetings to all who celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
The Mexican people prize liberty above all of life's blessings. That is why we in the United States are happy to rejoice with our southern neighbors each year on the anniversary of their great victory in the struggle for freedom and independence.
Outnumbered three to one, Mexican troops defeated invading French forces at the Battle of Puebla. We remember these brave sons of Mexico for their valor and for providing a lasting reminder that no threat or form of persecution can overcome a people's yearning for self-government. The story of this remarkable victory remains a source of hope and inspiration to freedom-loving people around the world.
In commemorating this great event in Mexican history, we also reaffirm our ties of culture and friendship with the people of Mexico and send them our good wishes. Vayan con Dios.
George Bush
