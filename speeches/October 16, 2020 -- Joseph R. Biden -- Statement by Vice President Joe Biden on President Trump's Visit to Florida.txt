    President Trump will hold another pair of events today, this time in Ocala and Fort Myers, where he is sure to continue to deflect and dodge his record. There's no hiding that Floridians are worse off after four years with President Trump at the helm. Under President Trump's watch, more than 15,000 Floridians have died from the coronavirus, Florida's tourism-based economy shrunk by 60% in the second quarter, and unemployment more than tripled in the state. Mr. President, what is your plan for Florida families?
Floridians deserve better than President Trump's weak leadership. I'll deliver for you, Florida. As President, I'll work with the scientists to get COVID-19 in check, create millions of good-paying union jobs to help our economy build back better, and strengthen and build on the Affordable Care Act to ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. Voting is happening now, and we can move forward together if we all make our voices heard.
