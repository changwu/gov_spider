    Eighteen months ago, I said that our decisions about energy would test the character of our people and the ability of our Nation to face its most difficult problems. Today the Congress has proven that we can meet that test.
By its vote today, the Congress has given us an energy plan that will advance our national security, ensure our freedom of action in foreign affairs, and protect our economic interests at home and abroad. We will begin down the other side of the mountain, away from the ever-mounting demand for energy and ever-shrinking supply. It sets our Nation on a course of conservation, exploration, and application of new technologies. It does so in a way that gives producers incentives that are adequate and consumers the supplies they need.
The result will not be overnight miracles. This is not the end of the road, but it is a beginning, and an important one.
We have declared to ourselves and the world our intent to control our use of energy and thereby to control our own destiny as a nation.
