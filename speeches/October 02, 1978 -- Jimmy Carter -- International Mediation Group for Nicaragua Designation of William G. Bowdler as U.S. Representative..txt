    President Carter has named Ambassador William G. Bowdler as the United States Representative on the International Mediation Group, which will be going to Nicaragua to provide good offices in an effort to reach a peaceful settlement of the current difficulties in that country.
Ambassador Bowdler expects to meet in the next few days with the representatives of the Dominican Republic and Guatemala, the other two countries in the mediation group, and will be going to Nicaragua with them later this week to commence the mediation process.
As the Secretary General of the OAS has announced, the Government of Nicaragua as well as the broad opposition front in Nicaragua have indicated their acceptance of this conciliation effort.
Ambassador Bowdler is a career Foreign Service officer who has served as Ambassador to El Salvador, Guatemala, and South Africa. In addition, he was the senior adviser for Latin American affairs on the National Security Council staff from 1965 to 1968. During the past 5 months, he has been serving in the Department of State as Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He holds the rank of Career Minister.
In naming an experienced diplomat and negotiator as U.S. Representative, President Carter said he hoped that all sides participating in the conversations will work constructively to develop an enduring, democratic solution.
