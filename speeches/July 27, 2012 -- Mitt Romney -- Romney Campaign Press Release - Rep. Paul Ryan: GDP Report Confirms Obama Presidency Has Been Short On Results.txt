    Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"When talking about his economic plan, President Obama may claim 'it worked,' but today's GDP report confirms that his presidency has been long on rhetoric and short on results. This disappointing news is just the latest sign of a failed economic agenda that has yet to turn the tide on 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent. Taken together with the president's recent comments dismissing the contributions of hard-working small-business owners and his six-month lapse in meeting with his Jobs Council, it has become all too clear that our nation deserves new leadership in the White House that shares voters' top priorities: creating jobs and getting our economy growing again."
