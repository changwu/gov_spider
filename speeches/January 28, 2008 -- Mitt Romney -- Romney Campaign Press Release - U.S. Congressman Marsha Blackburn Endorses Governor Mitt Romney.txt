Boston, MA â€“ Today, U.S. Congressman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) announced her endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney for President of the United States. Congressman Blackburn has served in Congress since 2003 and is a member of the Republican Study Committee.
"It is a pleasure to welcome Marsha back to our campaign to build a stronger America. As a rising conservative leader, she knows firsthand that we must bring conservative change to Washington. The only way we can do that is by returning to our core conservative principles of lowering taxes, restraining spending and streamlining government. I look forward to working with Marsha as we strengthen America through conservative change," said Governor Romney.
Announcing her support today, Congressman Blackburn said, "Tennesseans are looking for a real conservative to hold the White House in November, and I support Governor Romney as the true conservative choice for Tennessee.
