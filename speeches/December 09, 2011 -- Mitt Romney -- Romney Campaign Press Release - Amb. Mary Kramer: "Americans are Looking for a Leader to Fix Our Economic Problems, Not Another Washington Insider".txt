    Former State Senator and Ambassador Mary Kramer made the following statement on Newt Gingrich:
"Iowa voters deserve to know the differences between the candidates — it is part of the democratic process. One candidate, Newt Gingrich, is a creature of Washington. The other, Mitt Romney, is a conservative businessman who has spent his life building businesses and saving troubled organizations. Americans are looking for a leader to fix our economic problems, not another Washington insider who does not have experience creating jobs — that is what we have in the White House right now and it is not the solution to our country's difficulties."
