    Today, Congressman Charlie Dent endorsed Gov. John Kasich for president and joined his campaign as a member of the Kasich for America Leadership Team in Pennsylvania.
Dent praised the Ohio Governor stating, "John Kasich is a proven leader who knows what it takes to get things done for the American people. During his very successful time as the governor of Ohio and as chairman of the Budget Committee while in the House of Representatives, he repeatedly demonstrated his ability to bring both accountability and fiscal responsibility to government."
"Too many people feel that their voices are being drowned out by constant bickering and obstructionism in Washington. I believe John is the candidate who is humble enough to listen to the American people, reasonable enough to build consensus with lawmakers while maintaining commonsense principles and strong enough to bring real, effective governance to the White House. That is the type of leadership America needs now and that is why I am endorsing John Kasich for President of the United States," concluded Dent.

A life-long Lehigh Valley resident, Congressman Charlie Dent represents Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district. He is the co-chair of the TuesdayGroup, a group of center-right Republicans dedicated to promoting fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense. He has been a leader in Congress in shepherding support for real solutions that promote economic growth and stability.
Said Kasich, "I deeply respect Congressman Dent and his efforts to advance conservative solutions that bring lawmakers together in Congress on behalf of the American people. Day in and day out, Charlie puts the priorities of his constituents in Pennsylvania's 15th district above the fray of politics. I am grateful for his endorsement and he is a great addition to our team."
