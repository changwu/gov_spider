    In a sign of continuing support from America's first responders, the Rudy Giuliani Exploratory Committee today announced the Police Officers Association of Michigan (POAM) has endorsed Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be the next President of the United States.
"Under Mayor Rudy Giuliani's leadership, New York's police force increased by thousands of officers, crime was cut in half and the number of murders was reduced by two-thirds, spurring a renaissance across the city," said James Tignanelli, President of POAM.
James Tignanelli continued, "The leadership Rudy showed after September 11th only further proves that he is the right man for the job, and I am proud to give him our endorsement to be the next President of the United States."
