    Well, on behalf of President Donald Trump, I want to thank the Senate Majority Leader and your colleagues in the Senate who have committed to meet with an extraordinary American. In Judge Amy Coney Barrett, we have someone of great character, of great intellect, who has a judicial philosophy that will uphold the Constitution of the United States.
President Trump discharged his duty under Article Two to nominate Judge Barrett to the vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. And now we look forward, our entire team, Leader — working with you, Republicans in the Senate, and we hope Democrats in the Senate, as well — as you discharge your duty to advise and consent.
We truly do believe that Judge Barrett represents the best of America personally, in terms of her great intellect and her great background. And we have every confidence that as the American people learn more about Judge Amy Coney Barrett, they will be as inspired as President Trump was when he made her nomination.
We believe the Senate has an opportunity, Leader, for a fair and respectful consideration hearing. We urge our Democrat colleagues in the Senate to take the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett and, as the hearing goes forward, to provide the kind of respectful hearing that the American people expect.
We look forward to a vote in the Senate in the near future and to fill the seat on the Supreme Court of the United States because the American people deserve a justice like Judge Amy Coney Barrett. And the American people deserve nine justices on the Supreme Court of the United States.
So, thank you, Leader, for the warm welcome today, and we look forward to working with you.
