    The landmark trade agreements and assistance for American workers that passed tonight are a major win for American workers and businesses. I've fought to make sure that these trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama deliver the best possible deal for our country, and I've insisted that we do more to help American workers who have been affected by global competition. Tonight's vote, with bipartisan support, will significantly boost exports that bear the proud label "Made in America," support tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs, and protect labor rights, the environment, and intellectual property. American automakers, farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers, including many small businesses, will be able to compete and win in new markets. I look forward to signing these agreements, which will help achieve my goal of doubling American exports and keeping America competitive in the 21st century.
