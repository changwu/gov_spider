    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of the great entertainers of all time. Like all Americans, we are grateful George Burns kept us laughing for so long. As a young boy I enjoyed the Burns and Allen show every week. His sense of timing and captivating smile touched the hearts and funny bones of more than three generations. He enabled us to see humor in the toughest of times and laugh together as a Nation.
We will miss him greatly. Our prayers and sympathies go to his family and friends.
