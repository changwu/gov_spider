(House)
(Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-WI, and 27 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act. The President has called on Congress to enact important changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that enhance privacy and better safeguard our civil liberties, while keeping our Nation safe. The Administration applauds and appreciates the strong bipartisan and bicameral effort that led to the formulation of this bill, which strikes an appropriate balance between significant reform and preservation of important national security tools.
The bill strengthens the FISA's privacy and civil liberties protections, while preserving essential authorities our intelligence and law enforcement professionals need to protect the Nation. The bill would implement various reforms, including prohibiting bulk collection through the use of Section 215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters, while maintaining authorities to conduct more targeted collection. It also enhances transparency by expanding the amount of information providers can disclose and requiring the government to increase its public reporting as well.
The USA FREEDOM Act's significant reforms would provide the public greater trust and confidence in our national security programs and the checks and balances that form an integral part of their operation. Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that this legislation would reform could expire on June 1. The Administration supports swift House passage of the USA FREEDOM Act, and urges the Senate to follow suit.
