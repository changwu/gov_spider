    I've travelled across the world with Chuck Hagel, and I've seen him in action in the United States Senate. Wherever he is, his talent and dedication to our country are clear. He feels a deep commitment to our men and women in uniform, and as the head of the Pentagon I know their interests will always be close to his heart. Most importantly, I know the President will be able to rely on Chuck's sound, unvarnished judgment on any issue where our troops are involved. For that and many more reasons, I'm looking forward to working with Secretary Hagel.
