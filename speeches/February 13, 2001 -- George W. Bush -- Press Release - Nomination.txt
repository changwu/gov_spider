    President George W. Bush today announced his intention to nominate Governor Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States to Canada.
"Governor Paul Cellucci is a friend and a fellow governor. As a governor from the Northeast, he has worked closely with Canada over the years on issues of mutual concern like energy, trade, and preserving the environment. His appointment signifies the importance I place on the close relationship between the United States and Canada," said President Bush.
Paul Cellucci was first elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1998 after assuming the office in 1997, when then-Governor William Weld resigned his post. In the past he has served on the Hudson Board of Selectmen and was elected to four terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1984, he was elected to the state Senate and then was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1990.
Governor Cellucci received both his undergraduate and law degrees from Boston College and was a member of the U.S. Army Reserves. He lives with his wife and two children in Hudson, Massachusetts.
