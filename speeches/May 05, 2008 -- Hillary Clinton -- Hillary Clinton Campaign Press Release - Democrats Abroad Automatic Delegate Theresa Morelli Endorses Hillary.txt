    Democrats Abroad Automatic Delegate Theresa Morelli announced her support for Hillary Clinton today. Morelli lives in Milan, Italy.
"The fact that she has devoted her life to helping children and those less fortunate speak volumes about Hillary Clinton's character," Morelli said. "She has not only an incredible grasp of the issues facing America, but a track record of delivering real results. Hillary is the strongest Democratic candidate to beat John McCain in November and restore America's standing in the world."
"Hillary's championing of election reform and introducing of Count Every Vote Act goes hand in hand with Democrats Abroad launching of www.votefromabroad.org the most effective and comprehensive voter registration and absentee ballot request tool online."
