A blow to her head? Body found under his desk? Left Congress suddenly? Big topic of discussion in Florida...and, he's a Nut Job (with bad ratings). Keep digging, use forensic geniuses! https://t.co/UxbS5gZecdRetweets: 33749Favorites: 101467

The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes, print thousands of forgeries and "force" people to sign. Also, forge names. Some absentee OK, when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam!Retweets: 56449Favorites: 203405

A lot of interest in this story about Psycho Joe Scarborough. So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office, hit her head on his desk, & die? I would think there is a lot more to this story than that? An affair? What about the so-called investigator? Read story! https://t.co/CjBXBXxoNSRetweets: 25347Favorites: 69989

I always stand with leaders who weren't afraid to stand early with me. That's why I am supporting a true conservative, @DanJohnstonND for State Treasurer of North Dakota! https://t.co/CDkKewRcYzRetweets: 13499Favorites: 54182
