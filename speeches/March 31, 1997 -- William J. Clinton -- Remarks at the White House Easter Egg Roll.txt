    Good morning. Let me say, first of all, it's getting warmer. [Laughter] And I want to thank all the sponsors who make this possible this year and the more than 500 volunteers. A lot of them worked here all weekend. I went down and visited with them. Let's give them all a big hand. [Applause] Thank you very much.
This is the 119th year we've had the White House Easter egg roll, and every year it gets a little better, I think, and a little different. We've worked hard to make this a good time not only for children but for their parents and family members, so that we could have fun together and we could learn together.
There is a Learn Big Things tent, which I hope you'll all visit. For many of the young people, it will give them a first chance to log on to the Internet or even to visit our White House home page. There is a Learning Adventures tent where children can learn to use CD- ROM's and learn about things like nutrition. Then there is the opportunity to do Easter egg painting and to listen to storytelling.
And I want to thank all the people who have been willing to be part of this, especially one of our special guests today who is down here with us along with two of her four children, "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," Jane Seymour. Thank you, Jane, for coming. We're glad to have you here.
And now, are they ready over there at the Easter egg roll? Are you all ready? Now, you can't start until I blow the whistle. On your markâ€”are you ready? Come on, line up. Shape up here. One of us needs to be able to run. [Laughter] On your mark, get set, go.
[At this point, the President blew the whistle to start the egg roll.]
Thank you, and God bless you. Happy Easter.
