    Today I signed the Airline Transportation and Systems Stabilization Act, which will provide urgently needed tools to assure the safety and immediate stability of our Nation's commercial airline system. This important legislation also establishes a process for compensating victims of the terrorist attacks.
The terrorists who attacked our country on September 11th will not shut down our vital businesses or thwart our way of life. I commend the Congress for their cooperation and quick action in passing responsible legislation that will improve passenger safety, help the victims and their loved ones, and keep America's airplanes flying while the airlines develop long-term viability plans.
