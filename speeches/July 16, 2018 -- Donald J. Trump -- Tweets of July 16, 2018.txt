Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present & future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong & rich!Retweets: 21687Favorites: 102254

President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn't happen was no big deal & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!Retweets: 35163Favorites: 134117

As I said today and many times before 'I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.' However I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past ' as the world's two largest nuclear powers we must get along! #HELSINKI2018Retweets: 30096Favorites: 127784

I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. #HELSINKI2018 https://t.co/XdlrJWLPIhRetweets: 35487Favorites: 125110
