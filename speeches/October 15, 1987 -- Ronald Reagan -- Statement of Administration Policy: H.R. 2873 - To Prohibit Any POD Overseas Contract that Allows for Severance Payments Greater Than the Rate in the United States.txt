    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Kasich (R) Ohio and six others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2873 because it would unnecessarily restrict the ability of the Department of Defense to structure contracts to accommodate exceptional cases involving work performed overseas.
