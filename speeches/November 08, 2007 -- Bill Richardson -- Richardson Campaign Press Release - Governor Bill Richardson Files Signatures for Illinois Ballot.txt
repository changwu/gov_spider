    PORTSMOUTH, NH-- The Richardson for President campaign filed over 5,000 signatures in Illinois this week to place New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson's name on the Illinois Democratic ballot.
The signatures were gathered by an all-volunteer, grassroots organization of leaders from around the state, from Chicago to Centralia.
The volunteer organization also filed petitions for Democratic National Convention delegates and alternate delegates from across the state.
The delegate slate includes former 6th District Congressional candidate Christine Cegelis, former 11th District Congressional candidate John Pavich, former 19th District Congressional candidate Danny Stover, and local elected officials from across the state.
"Bill Richardson is not only the candidate of change and experience, he also has real solutions to end the war in Iraq, end our Middle East energy dependence, and fix our nation's education system," Cegelis said.
Cegelis and Chicago organizer Mike Fourcher serve as the Co-Chairs of Illinois for Richardson.
