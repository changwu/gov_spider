    I am pleased to announce the appointment of former Senator John Tower, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroftâ€”three distinguished experts in foreign policy and national security affairs-to serve as the members of the Special Review Board I announced yesterday. Former Senator Tower has agreed to serve as the Board's Chairman. As I indicated, the Special Review Board will conduct a comprehensive study of the future role and procedures of the National Security Council staff in the development, coordination, oversight, and conduct of foreign and national security policy.
In particular I have asked the Board to review the NSC staffs proper role in operational activities, especially extremely sensitive diplomatic, military, and intelligence missions. Specifically, they should look at the manner in which foreign and national security policies I established have been implemented by the NSC staff. In conducting their review, the Board will have full and complete access to the NSC staff and its resources as well as the cooperation of the other Departments and Agencies in the executive branch.
I hope the Board will conduct its review in a prompt and thorough manner. Upon its completion, I intend to share its findings with Congress and the American people.
