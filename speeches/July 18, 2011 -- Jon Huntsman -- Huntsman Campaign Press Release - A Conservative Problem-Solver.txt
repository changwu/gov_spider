    America needs new leadership and a new direction. We need a strong conservative in the White House with a record of delivering real results.
As governor, Jon signed the largest tax cut in Utah history, returning $400 million to taxpayers. He implemented a flat tax. He honestly balanced budgets, without accounting gimmicks or sleight of hand. He cut regulations. He tripled the size of the state's rainy day fund, even during the recession. 

Jon's free-market, job-friendly policies helped make Utah the fastest growing state in the nation and number one in job creation. It was named the best-managed state by Pew and the best state for business by Forbes.
Jon delivered market-based health care reforms that, in stark contrast to Massachusetts, did not include mandates and fines on individuals and businesses. He signed landmark legislation to protect the sanctity of life. He was also praised by the National Rifle Association for his strong support of the Second Amendment. Jon is the conservative problem-solver America needs. If you want to join our effort, please visit ConservativesForHuntsman.com and sign-up to show your support for our campaign.
