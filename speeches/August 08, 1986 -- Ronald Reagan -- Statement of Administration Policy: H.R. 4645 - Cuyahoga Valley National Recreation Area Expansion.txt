    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Seiberling (D) Ohio)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4645, which would provide for the potential addition of over 1,100 acres of land to the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (NRA). The only part of the additional acreage that has been identified as desirable for addition to the NRA is a 60-acre railroad right-of-way. About 580 acres of the proposed addition is land currently owned by the City of Akron, and would be added to the NRA if donated by the City or sold to private parties. This land includes a sewage treatment plant, a fire-fighting training school, and a dog training school. None of these properties are appropriate for inclusion in the NRA or for any other type of Federal management.
