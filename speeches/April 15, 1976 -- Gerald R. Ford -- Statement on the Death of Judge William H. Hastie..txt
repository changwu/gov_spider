    I AM deeply saddened to learn of the untimely death of senior Judge William H. Hastie, former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. His death is a great loss to the Nation, the judiciary, and the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules, where he served as Chairman.
Judge Hastie's outstanding abilities have long graced the Federal judiciary. His life in public office as a lawyer, as dean of Howard University Law School, and as the first black Federal Judge have left an indelible imprint on the Nation.
