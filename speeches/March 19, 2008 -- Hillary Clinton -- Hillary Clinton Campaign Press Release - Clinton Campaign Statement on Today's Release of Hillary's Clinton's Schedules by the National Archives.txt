    The following statement was released today by Clinton Campaign spokesman, Jay Carson.
Today, the National Archives released Hillary Clinton's daily schedules from her eight years as First Lady. These documents -- over 11,000 pages total -- add to an already voluminous public record of events and activities during the Clinton Administration. The release of these documents underscores President Clinton's efforts to encourage public access to the record of his Presidency. Indeed, his representative encouraged the Archives to release significantly more information than required by the Presidential Records Act - and more than the Archives originally designated for release.
These documents are outlines of the First Lady's activities and illustrate the array of substantive issues she worked on -- including health care, child care, adoption, education, veterans, microenterprise and international development, women's rights, and democracy. Her daily schedules also list some of the meetings and travel she conducted to more than 80 countries in pursuit of the Administration's domestic and foreign policy goals. They are a guide, and of course cannot reflect all of Senator Clinton's activities as First Lady.
The schedules do help illustrate Hillary Clinton's extensive and exhaustive work as a public servant and her role as an influential advocate at home and around the world on behalf of our country. As such, they are a valuable addition to the substantive and vast public record already made available by President Clinton.
Sen. Obama and his campaign like to talk about transparency. We call on him to back up his words with action and release his schedules and other records from his time as an Illinois State Senator.
