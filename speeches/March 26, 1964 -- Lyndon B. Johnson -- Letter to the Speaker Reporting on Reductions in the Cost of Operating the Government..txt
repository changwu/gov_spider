    Sir:
On November 30 and December 24, 1963, I directed the heads of executive departments and agencies to tighten operations, reduce employment and effect savings. As a result of the steps being taken pursuant to these instructions, I asked the Congress on March 9 to reduce the 1965 appropriations requested in the budget by $41,927,000.
The cost reduction actions underway will also reduce the need for funds already appropriated by the Congress for the fiscal year 1964. In addition, section 603 of the 1964 Foreign Aid and Related Agencies Appropriation Act requires that such savings as might result from delayed enactment of the 1964 appropriation acts be reserved from obligation. Therefore, I directed the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to scrutinize critically the apportionment of the 1964 appropriations for the purpose of reserving savings for eventual return to the Treasury.
The Director has reported to me that a total of $50,336,77Â° is being reserved from obligation at the present time. These savings result from changed program and legislative requirements, planned reductions in civilian employment, improvements in management and efficiency, the delay in final enactment of 1964 appropriations, and other factors. I have directed that the current cost reduction efforts be intensified in order to increase further the amount saved.
Of the sum currently reserved, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget is confident that $34,907,570 will not be needed. A list of the amounts comprising this total, by accounts, is attached. It contains 62 items, several of them less than $1,500, consistent with my philosophy that no saving is too small to be ignored. These amounts will be retained in reserve so that they cannot be spent under any circumstances. Alternatively, if the Congress should wish to rescind these amounts, I would have no objection.
Respectfully yours,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Speaker of the House of Representatives]
