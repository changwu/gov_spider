Hillary Clinton for President today announced the appointment of Geoff Wetrosky as South Dakota state director. Wetrosky, a South Dakota native, will oversee the campaign's operation in the important final primary and will work out of Sioux Falls.
"I couldn't be happier working to elect a candidate who understands and respects the needs of South Dakotans. Hillary has real solutions to jumpstart the economy here, provide health insurance for all South Dakotans, and be a strong commander-in-chief," Wetrosky said. "We will wage a vigorous campaign here to build on the grassroots support of our committed volunteers already working hard for Hillary in South Dakota."
Wetrosky was born and raised in Beresford in southeastern South Dakota. He graduated from Beresford High School and Augustana College in Sioux Falls, SD. He has served on the Clinton campaign for more than a year, working as Deputy Field Director in New Hampshire, Georgia Field Director, Texas Voter Contact Director, and Pennsylvania Voter Contact Director.
Prior to joining the campaign, Wetrosky worked as a Field Organizer for Senator Tim Johnson's 2002 reelection campaign, and Field Director for Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth when she was first elected in a 2004 special election. He also worked for John Kerry in Florida in the 2004 general election, and for Deval Patrick's 2006 gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts.
