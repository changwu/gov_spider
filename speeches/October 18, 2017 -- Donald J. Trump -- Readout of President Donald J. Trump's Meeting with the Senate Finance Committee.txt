    President Donald J. Trump had a productive meeting at the White House today with the bipartisan group of Senators from the Senate Finance Committee. The group discussed the historic nature of tax cuts and reform, and stressed the urgent need to deliver tax relief for the middle class by cutting taxes and simplifying the burdensome tax code. The Administration looks forward to continued opportunities to reach across the aisle in an effort to provide tangible quality of life improvements for the American people.
