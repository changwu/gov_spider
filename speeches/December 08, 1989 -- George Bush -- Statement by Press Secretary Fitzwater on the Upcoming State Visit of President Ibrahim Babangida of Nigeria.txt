    President Bush has invited Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to make a state visit to the United States, beginning on January 17, 1990. President Babangida will be making the first state visit by an African chief of state in the Bush administration. The United States enjoys cordial relations and growing cooperation with Nigeria. It supports President Babangida's ambitious economic reform program and commitment to return Nigeria to civilian, democratic rule by 1992. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, a major exporter of oil, and one of the United States' most important trading partners in Africa.
