    I am delighted that loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have today committed themselves to an open-ended cessation of hostilities and developed peaceful mechanisms to address disputes that may arise. This action responds to the overwhelming desire of the people of Northern Ireland to see their peace flourish and endure, which I sensed during my visit this week. I congratulate the loyalist political leaders who I know worked so hard to bring this about.
