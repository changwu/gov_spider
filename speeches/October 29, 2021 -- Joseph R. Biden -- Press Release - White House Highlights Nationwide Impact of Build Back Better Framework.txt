    Today, the White House released state-by-state fact sheets that highlight how the Build Back Better Framework will impact working families across the country. The Build Back Better Framework includes transformative investments in climate, care, and kids that will lower the costs of things families depend on, help people get back to work, and grow the economy.
The framework will help the U.S. meet its climate goals, create millions of good-paying jobs, enable more Americans to join and remain in the labor force, and grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And, it will level the playing field and make corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share, so that middle class families can finally get some breathing room.
