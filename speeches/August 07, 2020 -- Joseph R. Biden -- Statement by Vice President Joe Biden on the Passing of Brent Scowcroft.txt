    Brent Scowcroft was a statesman, strategist, general, and patriot who dedicated his life to the security of the American people. He was present at the creation of a new era in American foreign policy in helping President George H.W. Bush to manage the peaceful end of the Cold War. In doing so, he quite literally reshaped our world. His dedication transcended political ideology, which is why presidents, vice presidents, and foreign policy thinkers of both Republican and Democratic administrations sought and valued his counsel. His leadership as national security advisor continues to serve as a gold standard, and his example will inspire future generations of policy makers to serve our country with honor. Jill and I send our deepest condolences to his daughter Karen, and the entire Scowcroft family.
