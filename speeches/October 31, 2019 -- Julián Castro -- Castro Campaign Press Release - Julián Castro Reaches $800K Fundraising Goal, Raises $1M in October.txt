    SAN ANTONIO, TX (October 31, 2019) – On Thursday, October 31, the presidential campaign of former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro announced that the campaign had reached the $800,000 fundraising goal it had set to sustain the campaign and make a push for the November and December Democratic debates.
The campaign highlighted that it had received more than $1 million for the month of October from nearly 50,000 donors, and had the best fundraising day of the campaign since August on Thursday, October 31.
"Time and time again this campaign has defied expectations with the support of an army of dedicated, grassroots supporters," said campaign manager Maya Rupert. "We set an extremely ambitious goal to keep Secretary Castro's voice in this race, and our supporters met the challenge and delivered one of the best months of the campaign to date. We're not going anywhere--Julián will keep being a voice for the voiceless, and a champion for the Americans who have been left behind. We will keep lifting up important issues others choose to ignore, and demonstrating by example why Secretary Castro is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump."
On Friday, November 1 through Monday, November 4, Secretary Castro will return to Iowa to discuss affordable housing following a tour of a long-term housing facility, speak at the Liberty and Justice Celebration, and join a town hall hosted by the NAACP of Des Moines.
