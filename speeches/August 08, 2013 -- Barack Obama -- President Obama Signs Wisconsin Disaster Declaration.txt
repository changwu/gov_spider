Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, and mudslides in Ashland, Bayfield, Crawford, Grant, Iowa, Richland, St. Croix, and Vernon Counties and the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Bayfield County.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for all counties and Tribes within the state.
