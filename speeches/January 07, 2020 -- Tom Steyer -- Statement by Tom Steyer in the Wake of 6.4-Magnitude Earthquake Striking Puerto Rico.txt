    (SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 7, 2020) â€” Today, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer released the below statement following news that a 6.4-magnitude earthquake had struck Puerto Rico on Tuesday, taking at least one life, collapsing buildings and cutting power to the island:
"Today, my heart goes out to the people of Puerto Rico who have experienced yet another devastating earthquake on their island. My thoughts are with all those who have been affected, as well as with the first responders demonstrating unparalleled courage and poise at a time of fear and uncertainty.
"A catastrophe of this magnitude deserves the immediate attention of the Trump Administration. The people of Puerto Rico cannot afford to suffer the same neglect and lack of urgency that permeated his response to Hurricane Maria. President Trump should order FEMA and other relevant agencies to send immediate aid. Puerto Ricans deserve help from their government and they deserve it now."
