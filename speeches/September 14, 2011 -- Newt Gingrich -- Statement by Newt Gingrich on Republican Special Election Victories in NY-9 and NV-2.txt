    Atlanta, GA - Newt Gingrich released the following statement today:
"The Republican victories in New York and Nevada are a healthy repudiation of the failures of the Obama policies.
"They are also an immediate and dramatic rejection of President Obama's joint session address and his new big-government, big-spending bill.
"The loss of Senator Schumer's former House seat, a completely safe Democratic seat before the failures of the Obama administration, should embolden Democrats and Republicans alike to ignore the new Obama legislative proposal and focus on effective solutions to put Americans back to work."
