    I am delighted the President has nominated Laura Holgate to serve as Ambassador and U.S. Representative to the Vienna Office of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Laura's wisdom, talent, and exceptional leadership make her uniquely qualified to serve in this role. Laura has served in senior positions across the U.S. Government for 14 years, and has advised the President for over six years in the position of Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for WMD Terrorism and Threat Reduction on the National Security Council staff.
Laura has spent her career building and leading global coalitions to prevent states and terrorists from acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction. As Nuclear Security Summit Sherpa, she has been the life blood of that effort since its inception in 2009, leading to the strengthening the global nuclear security architecture, reduction of weapons-usable nuclear material, and prevention of nuclear smuggling. She also led the historic global effort to destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, and she envisioned and launched our Global Health Security Agenda. While we will deeply miss her at the White House, there is no better person than Laura to lead our Delegation in Vienna during this critical time.
