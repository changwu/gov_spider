Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!Retweets: 22372Favorites: 95052

Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session!Retweets: 6336Favorites: 21118
