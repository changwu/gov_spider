    Today, legendary former quarterback and head coach of the Green Bay Packers Bart Starr endorsed Governor Mitt Romney for President of the United States, issuing the following statement:
"During the course of my football and business careers, I have had the great honor of meeting and associating with many outstanding leaders. This list includes some of the best football coaches of all time and numerous small-business owners. There are certain consistent qualities in each of these men — integrity, unselfishness, vision, dedication, and a willingness to unify individuals into a team — that I see in Governor Mitt Romney. He has been successful in every endeavor he has pursued, and I have every confidence that, if elected president, he would continue that remarkable level of success."
