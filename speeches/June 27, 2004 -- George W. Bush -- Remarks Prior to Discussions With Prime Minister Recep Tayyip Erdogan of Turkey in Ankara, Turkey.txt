    Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. You're right, this is my first trip to your beautiful country as President. It also happens to be my first trip to your beautiful country ever, and we're honored to be here. We appreciate the hospitality of the Turkish people.
We look forward to meaningful discussions on a variety of subjects, bilateral relations, how we can strengthen NATO. I would remind the people of this good country that I believe you ought to be given a date by the EU for your eventual acceptance into the EU. I also look forward to working with you on matters regarding the neighborhood, Iraq and elsewhere. I appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a Muslim country and, at the same time, a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom.
And so I'm so grateful for your invitation. Thank you very much for it, and I look forward to a fruitful discussion with you and with our NATO partners.
