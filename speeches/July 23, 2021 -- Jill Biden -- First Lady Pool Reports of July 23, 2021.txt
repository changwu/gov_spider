FLOTUS Pool Report No. 1 - overview of Friday 
Happy Friday from Tokyo. Your pool is in place at the Akasaka Palace for Dr. Biden's event with Mariko Suga.
Pool was temperature checked and is waiting, shoeless, for the event to begin at 10 a.m.
As a bilateral cultural event, Mrs. Suga has prepared an incense workshop for FLOTUS.
In addition, pool is expected to have access to Biden's virtual meet-and-greet with Team USA athletes. And for her arrival at the Imperial Palace.
Pool will not accompany her into the Opening Ceremony.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Again, I'll be putting pictures in the Dropbox account that I shared a link to in Wednesday's Pool Report No. 1.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 2 - Cultural event with Mrs. Suga
Pool was told at 9:58 a.m. that FLOTUS arrived through the palace gates.
She and Mrs. Suga walked into the room for the event at 10:01 a.m. Biden is again wearing slipper-socks. She's wearing a trench-length grey blazer over a white top. She's wearing a black mask. She told the pool "good morning" before being introduced to the workshop host. She has a translator sitting next to her whispering to her in English.
The room for the event is set up with two desks - one for Dr. Biden and one for Mrs. Suga - with a plexiglass screen in front so the lecturer and another woman are protected. Lecturer is wearing a pale yellow kimono. Event is being held in Japanese.
Biden is smelling incense in small glass bowls. She is taking off her mask to get a good whiff. I'm told that sandalwood is being explained. Then she tried cinnamon and is being told how it's used for perfume and cooking.
"Oh that's strong, that wakes you up, right?"Biden then said. Unclear what the scent was, pool is trying to find out.
Biden is wearing a pin that was a gift from Mrs. Suga when her husband visited the White House earlier this year, her spokesman said.
Biden and Suga's backs are facing floor to ceiling windows and pool can see a koi pond directly outside.
Pool was pulled at 10:11 a.m.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 3 - additional incense details 
The scent Dr. Biden thought was strong was Palo Santo.
The East Wing sends along more information about the Koju Raku Incense Workshop. Apologies if the formatting is odd, it came from PDFs. I'll try to upload them to the Dropbox as well.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 4 - Team USA Zoom 
Pool was pulled into an ornate room in the ambassador's residecne at 11:31 a.m.
Dr. Biden was standing in place, wearing a white dress with a white USA jacket over it. The jacket has Navy lettering and blue and red piping on the sleeves and collar. She's wearing black heels with grey square bows. CNN's Kate Bennett tells me the dress is Michael Kors.
A Zoom screen is over her shoulder has 25 different screens showing athletes competing in the Tokyo games.
Biden is speaking into a camera, reading from a teleprompter, and delivering an inspirational message to the athletes.
"I want to thank each person who helped you be here today. Now those years of work, the drive and faith that have kept you going, have led you here. Congratulations."
"Becoming an Olympian is a rare accomplishment in a normal time. But you did it during a global pandemic."
"In these moments we are more than our cities or states or backgrounds. We are more than our jobs or are political parties."
"We are Team USA."
She finished her planned remarks at 11:35 p.m.
Sarah Hirshland, chief executive officer of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee, was then introduced to a number of athletes to the first lady. Because NBC has the rights to the Olympics, pool is not able to name the athletes.
"Go for the doctorate" she encouraged one of the athletes.
She also complimented an athlete for doing work on mental health issues.
"I'm so looking forward to watching you compete and as a teacher I think what you're doing is so important in that area of mental health because I know that a lot of students as they return back to school this fall are going to need a little help," Biden said.
"We'll be watching!" she encouraged the athletes.
"It was emotional," she told pool after the event concluded of seeing the athletes. "Thank you for your help," she then staff.
"It meant a lot to me. And to Joe. It should be exciting to watch the events. Am I allowed to shake hands?" she asked the staff, giving out elbows. "Just pretend these are hugs." She then exited.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 5 - more Team USA quotes and athlete names 
Here are additional quotes from the Team USA event â€“ and, good news, we are able to use the names of the athletes.
"For most of you, the journey to Tokyo began long, long ago. It likely started at a young age. The first time you picked up a ball or jumped in the water. The first ride that made you feel really free. Or when the backflip you thought was impossible suddenly wasn't," Biden said.
"You've given up so much to be here. You've sacrificed time with friends and pushed yourself harder than you thought you could," Biden said.
"Your journey was supported by dedicated parents and siblings, grandparents and cousins, friends, classmates and, of course, the coaches that guided you along the way to Tokyo," Biden said.
The first athlete she spoke to was Eddy Alvarez, a baseball player and a short track speed skater. He's a flagbearer this year.
"Thank you so much, I love seeing you â€“ you must be so excited!" she said giggling.
She then spoke to Sue Bird, a basketball player and flagbearer.
"You are one amazing woman," Biden said.
She then spoke to Allison Schmitt, a four-time Olympic swimmer and mental health advocate.
"I think it's an even bigger honor that you're not just FLOTUS, but you're a Dr. Jill Biden," Schmitt said.
Biden then commended Schmitt's mental health work.
Schmitt says she's currently doing her master's.
"Go for the doctorate," Biden advised.
And one quick correx â€“ she finished her planned remarks at 11:35 a.m. not p.m. â€“ I blame the jetlag.

Dr. Biden is attending a meet-and-greet at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo with Emperor Naruhito and other heads of state and heads of delegations.
Prior to Biden's arrival, pool spotted French President Emmanuel Macron and Albert II, Prince of Monaco. Also, Polish President Andrzej Duda. I'll send the full list of leaders in the next report.
Each of the delegation vehicles is sporting the country's flag. Two soldiers in grey-blue uniforms are flanking the doors.
Biden's motorcade pulled up at 2:23 p.m. The largest of any leader.
She is wearing a white draped dress with black polka dots. She acknowledged the greeter. She walked into the palace a moment later.
Pool is now splitting off from FLOTUS for the rest of the day. She won't have press with her for the Opening Ceremony.
