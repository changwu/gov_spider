    Greetings to the men and women of the Armed Forces stationed around the world as we celebrate Armed Forces Day, 1994. On behalf of the American people, I am proud to extend heartfelt appreciation for your tremendous service to our country.
Each of you who wears our nation's uniform makes an invaluable contribution to the safety, security, and well-being of the United States and of the entire world. Some of you serve here at home, while others are posted the world over, but all of you work to guard our precious freedom and to further the goals of peace and democracy. In addition to these traditional military roles, you have set a new standard of excellence for international humanitarian effortsâ€” bringing food, shelter, and medical relief to people in desperate need.
On this important day, I am honored to salute the hard-working individuals serving in the Army, the Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Coast Guard. American owes you a debt of gratitude for all that you have done for our Nation and for all that you continue to do to protect the blessings of liberty we cherish.
BILL CLINTON
