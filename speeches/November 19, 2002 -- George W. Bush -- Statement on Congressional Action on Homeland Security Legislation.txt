    The United States Congress has taken an historic and bold step forward to protect the American people by passing legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security. This landmark legislation, the most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s, will help our Nation meet the emerging threats of terrorism in the 21st century.
This bill includes the major components of my proposalâ€”providing for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, strengthening our borders, improving the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and creating a comprehensive response and recovery division.
I commend the employees who will move into this new Department for their hard work and dedication to the war on terrorism. Setting up this new Department will take time, but I know we will meet the challenge together.
I look forward to signing this important legislation.
