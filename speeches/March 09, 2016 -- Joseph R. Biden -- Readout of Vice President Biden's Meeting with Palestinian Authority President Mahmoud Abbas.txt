    The Vice President met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas tonight in Ramallah. The two leaders discussed the ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, including the tragic terrorist attack yesterday in Jaffa that killed U.S. citizen Taylor Force, which the Vice President strongly condemned. The Vice President reiterated the United States' enduring support for a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and urged all parties to take steps to de-escalate tensions, uphold obligations, and prevent inflammatory rhetoric.
