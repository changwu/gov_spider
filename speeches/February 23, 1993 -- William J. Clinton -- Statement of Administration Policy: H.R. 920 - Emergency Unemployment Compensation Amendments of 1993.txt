    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 2/24/93)(House)(Rostenkowski (D) IL and two others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 920 and urges its quick enactment. This legislation would assist the unemployed and their families by extending the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program through October 2, 1993. The program will expire in less than two weeks under current law. In addition, H.R. 920 includes an innovative worker profiling program to encourage States to use the Unemployment Insurance system to link permanently displaced workers to reemployment services. This program would assist workers to gain new jobs early in their period of unemployment.
