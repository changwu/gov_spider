    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bilbray (D) Nevada)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4559, but will work in the Senate to amend section 8 which reserves water rights for the proposed Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada. Section 8 should stipulate that any reservation of water rights needed for the conservation area should be done under State law.
