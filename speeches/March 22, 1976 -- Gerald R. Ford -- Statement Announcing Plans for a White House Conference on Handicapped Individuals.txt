    AT THE request of the National Planning and Advisory Council to the White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and with the authorization of the Congress, I hereby declare that the White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals shall be held in spring 1977.
A spring 1977 Conference is strongly supported by many of the States and by various organizations for the handicapped. This will allow the States time to plan their conferences properly and involve more people, especially the handicapped. This should contribute to a better National Conference.
I feel that this involvement is important. As I said when I announced the Conference last November, a major purpose of this Conference is to generate a responsive national awareness of the problems facing the handicapped. Concern for the handicapped should not be limited to the Federal Government. State and local officials and private citizens as well, must turn their attention to the needs of the handicapped. The private sector can perform a creative role by contributing its talents and resources.
The White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals is a very important occasion which should contribute significantly to the health, education, and welfare of handicapped individuals everywhere.
