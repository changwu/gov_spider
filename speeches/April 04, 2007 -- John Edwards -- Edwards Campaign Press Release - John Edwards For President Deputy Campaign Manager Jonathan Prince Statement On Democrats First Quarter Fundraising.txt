    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – John Edwards for President Deputy Campaign Manager Jonathan Prince made the following statement today about the release of the first quarter fundraising numbers:
"There's an enormous amount of support for Democrats as we've seen with our own fundraising efforts. It's clear that three campaigns are going to have more than enough money to win the nomination and communicate their ideas to voters—and it's those ideas that will ultimately decide the nomination."
