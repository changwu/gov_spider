    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin issued the following statement concerning proposals for a new economic stimulus:
"We are deeply concerned about our nation's economic outlook and will support measures that improve the outlook for American families. This economic crisis has its roots in the housing market and the most effective stimulus will be to reverse the cycle of foreclosure, neighborhood blight, and falling housing values. The American Homeownership Resurgence Plan is the best kind of stimulus.
"The Democrat-controlled Congress will likely propose additional measures. We do not believe that a national crisis should be taken as a license for wasteful spending or earmarked projects. Each new proposal must pass on the grounds that it is timely, effective in supporting business sales and job creation, and consistent with long-term fiscal discipline.
"In the past, raising taxes and cutting off international trade have only served to make hard economic times worse. We oppose harmful attempts to just 'spread the wealth.' Our job-creating economic plan is the best path for the economy and includes the types of policies that the Congress should consider."
