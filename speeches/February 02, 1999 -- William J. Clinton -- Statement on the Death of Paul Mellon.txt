    Hillary and I are saddened by the death of Paul Mellon, one of America's most dedicated philanthropists. His generosity over a long lifetime invigorated and sustained our Nation's cultural and educational institutions. Carrying on his family's work, he donated a remarkable collection of priceless art to the National Gallery of Art, so that it could be enjoyed by future generations. He gave the Nation the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and led the restoration of Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House. He received the National Medal of the Arts and the National Medal for the Humanities, but his true recognition comes from the millions of people whose love of art his gifts inspired. His legacy of commitment to public service is, itself, priceless. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Bunny, his children, Catherine and Timothy, and his grandchildren.
