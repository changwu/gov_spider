    SANTA FE -- Governor Bill Richardson today ordered flags to fly at half-staff to honor the nine South Carolina firefighters who were killed in the line of duty.
"Firefighters are trained to make the ultimate sacrifice -- to walk into the worst danger and to risk their lives without hesitation," said Governor Bill Richardson. "Early this week, nine South Carolina firefighters ran into a burning building to protect the lives of their fellow citizens trapped inside. These firefighters taught us the true meaning of the words courage, honor, and duty."
"The citizens of New Mexico are grateful for the actions of these selfless heroes and it is with great sadness that we extend our thoughts and prayers to the families and friends that were left behind."
In honor and mourning of the South Carolina Firefighters killed in the line of duty earlier this week, Governor Richardson ordered that all flags be flown at half-staff on Friday, June 22, 2007.
