    "I want to commend Ed for a lifetime of hard work on behalf of America's teachers and thank him for his service. I have been proud to call Ed a friend for many years. Under his leadership, the AFT membership has grown by 500,000, and that growth is a tribute to the investments, strategy, and relentlessness that Ed has demonstrated personally and instilled throughout the AFT's ranks. Ed is a proud trade unionist whose commitment to working people is unparalleled. His two passions throughout his career have been to better the lives of working men and women and to help building a world-class public education system that prepares every child in America to reach her full potential. I know that Ed will continue to be committed to both important goals. I look forward to his continued friendship and guidance."
