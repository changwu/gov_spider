MITT ROMNEY: "I will make sure that in terms of certainty, we will not only repeal and replace Obamacare, we'll keep your taxes from getting higher and higher. Small business is crushed by taxes. I was with an employer in St. Louis. He has four employees. He calculated how much of what his business makes goes to taxes every year. Federal income taxes, federal payroll taxes, state income taxes, state sales taxes, highway taxes -- gasoline taxes, that is -- and the like. He added it all up, and it was over half of what he made was going to tax. And for a small business that doesn't know whether it's going make it or not, then when it makes it, to have half of what it goes going to taxes, it makes it a real hard decision to go out and hire people and start a business. And what I'm going to tell you is I want to bring your tax rates down for small business so you have certainty you can hire more people. Thank you."
