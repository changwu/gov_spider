The White House Christmas tree was selected in October by White House Chief Usher Gary Walters and White House Superintendent of Grounds Irv Williams.
The Tillmans were named the 2004 National Grand Champion Growers by the National Christmas Tree Association.
The tree will adorn the Blue Room on the State Floor of the White House.
Two trees were selected from their farm, Northwest Plantations, to be placed in the Oval Office and at Camp David.
The official White House Christmas tree presentation dates back to 1966 during the Johnson administration. That year, the tree was a Balsam fir, grown by Howard Pierce of Sparta, Wisconsin.
