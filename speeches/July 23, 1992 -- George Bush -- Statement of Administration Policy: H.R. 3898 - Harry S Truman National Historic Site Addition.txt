    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/24/92)(House)(Wheat (D) MO)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3898. The proposed site has been seriously compromised by adjacent commercial development and is not appropriate for addition to the National Park System. The National Park Service believes that the farm site lacks curatorial potential and that it is not possible to interpret President Truman's farm life at the site in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the immediate addition to a park unit would subvert the statutory requirement to evaluate proposed boundary adjustments according to established criteria. The preservation of this site should remain the responsibility of Jackson County, Missouri.
