    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today announced key members of his Nevada leadership team. Jeremy Hughes will serve as state director and Kristin Vieria as deputy state director.
"I am excited to be expanding our campaign operation into Nevada and have full confidence in Jeremy and Kristin as they take the helm of our efforts in this important state," said Gov. Perry. "I look forward to working with them as I share my vision to get America working again across the state of Nevada and beyond."
Hughes most recently worked on Mississippi State Treasurer Tate Reeves' campaign for Lt. Governor. He also previously worked for Kentucky Congressman Geoff Davis and was executive director of Freedom Vote, an Ohio-based non-profit, focusing on voter turnout efforts in the state.
Vieria is former deputy director of the 2010 Nevada GOP Victory operation and has worked on other statewide campaigns in Nevada and other western states.
