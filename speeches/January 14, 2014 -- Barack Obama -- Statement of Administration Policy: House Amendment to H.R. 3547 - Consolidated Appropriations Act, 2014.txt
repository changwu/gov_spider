(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3547, making appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes. The legislation adheres to the funding levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and reflects compromise by both parties. It unwinds some of the damaging cuts caused by sequestration, ensures the continuation of critical services that the American people depend on, and invests in essential areas such as education, infrastructure, manufacturing, and scientific research, which contribute to growing the economy, creating jobs, and strengthening the middle class. Further, H.R. 3547 is a positive step forward that helps return the budget process to regular order. The Administration urges swift passage of the legislation.
