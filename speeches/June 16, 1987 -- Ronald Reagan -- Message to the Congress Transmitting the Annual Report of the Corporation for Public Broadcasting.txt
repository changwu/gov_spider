    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for Fiscal Year 1986. The report states that the Corporation will seek appropriations at the full amount authorized through 1990. This does not reflect my views and exceeds my budget by $44 million in 1988, $88 million in 1989, and $122 million in 1990. I request that the Congress appropriate no more than the level I have proposed.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House, June 16, 1987.
