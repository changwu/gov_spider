    Dear John:
As you have requested in your letter of February 15, I accept your resignation as Attorney General effective March 1, 1972. I do so on a note of the utmost regret-but a regret compensated by a sense of personal and heartfelt gratitude on behalf of myself and all Americans.
As chief legal advisor to the President, and as the leader of our fight against crime and lawlessness, you have left a permanent imprint for the better on our Nation of which I am immensely proud. You have made this a time of historic accomplishment in expanding and intensifying the Federal Government's anti-crime efforts, in launching new and more effective efforts to combat drug abuse, in improving the system of justice for all, and, not least, in developing greater public support for the forces of law and justice throughout the country. You have given the American people new--and newly justified-confidence in their ability to halt the spiral of crime, and to restore domestic peace.
Your consistently wise advice and counsel have been of immense value to me throughout the course of our Administration, and I know I can speak for all of your colleagues in saying we shall greatly miss you around the Cabinet table.
As you leave our official family, you do so with the warmest of good wishes and with deep thanks for a difficult task superbly done.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable John N. Mitchell, The Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.]
