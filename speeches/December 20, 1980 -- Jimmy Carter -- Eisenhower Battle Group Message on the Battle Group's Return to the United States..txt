    Welcome home.
This is a great dayâ€”a proud day for our nation and our navy.
As the Eisenhower Battle Group represents the naval power of our country, you, individually, represent the moral power of free men. You have represented your country to everyone in the world. Embodying the dauntless spirit of America, your battle group has made manifest the resolve of the United States to stand firm in support of our nation's basic principles. You have shown our strength and our will to meet any challenge.
Deployed to the Indian Ocean, you have reassured our nation, our allies and the entire world that the United States dedicates its power to the preservation of peace.
Well done from a grateful nation. Best wishes for a joyous reunion with your families and loved ones.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
