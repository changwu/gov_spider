    Hillary Clinton issued a statement following the endorsement of Transport Workers Union of America Locals 502, 505, and 250-A, three California-based local chapters that fight for transit workers statewide:
"I am honored and grateful to have earned the endorsement of the Transport Workers Union of America Locals 502, 505, and 250-A.
"In California and all across the country, the diverse members of the TWU keep our airplanes flying, our trains running, and our buses driving. The members of Locals 502, 505, and 250-A are no exception. They keep passengers and residents alike safe, healthy, and moving every day. In the process, they've helped to build the American middle class. And they've stood up and demanded the fair treatment and respect that they deserve.
"As President, I'll stand with the workers of Locals 502, 505, and 250-A. I'll never stop fighting to protect workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. I'll fight to stop big corporations from padding their bottom lines by cutting workers' wages and sacrificing health and retirement benefits. And because infrastructure is so vital to our economy, in my first 100 days, I'll propose the biggest investment in American infrastructure since we built the Interstate Highway System. If I'm elected president, organized labor will always have a champion in the White House and a seat at the table."
