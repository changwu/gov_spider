    We made note of Nicaragua's intransigence there in negotiations. It is regrettable that Nicaragua has not engaged in serious negotiations in Panama City with the Contadora countries. It is clear that other Central American countries were prepared to have serious discussions. The Nicaraguans refused to take part in constructive talks. We note that the communique gives Nicaragua another week to reconsider its position. It is also interesting to note that the behind-the-scenes role of Cubans in advising the Nicaraguan delegation has come to light.
