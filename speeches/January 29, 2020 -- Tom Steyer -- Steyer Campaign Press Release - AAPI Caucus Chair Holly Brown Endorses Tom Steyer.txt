    (DES MOINES, IA, January 29, 2020) â€” Presidential candidate Tom Steyer has been endorsed by Holly Brown, a leader in Cedar Rapids who serves as the chair of the Iowa Democratic Party's Asian American and Pacific Islander Caucus. After attending a TeamTom lunar new year celebration and learning more about Tom's vision and values, Brown left ready to support Steyer. Brown said this about her endorsement:
"When I think of the person I want to lead our country, I want someone willing to listen, learn, and grow. I have seen Tom Steyer meeting and genuinely listening to marginalized communities, and he has shown that he is learning from those experiences. To me, this is the mark of a true leader. For these reasons and so much more, I am proud to endorse Tom Steyer as president of the United States."
In the final days before the caucus, Steyer is seeing strong momentum, especially with people of color. It's going to take a diverse coalition to beat Trump in November and a candidate who is going to all communities, organizing all people, and talking to their issues. Steyer has recently been endorsed by local LULAC leader Jessica Trinidad and NAACP leader Sherry Washington.
