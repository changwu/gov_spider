    Under authority of the act of Congress approved June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 36; U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and on the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that the Natural Bridge National Forest as defined by proclamation of September 12, 1927 (45 Stat. 2924), be consolidated with the George Washington National Forest as defined by proclamation of January 28, 1927 (44 Stat. 2633), for the Shenandoah National Forest, the name of which was changed to George Washington National Forest by Executive Order No. 5867 of June 28, 1932. The areas hitherto comprising the Natural Bridge and George Washington National Forests shall hereafter be known as the George Washington National Forest.
It is not intended by this order to give any publicly owned lands a nationalforest status which have hitherto not had such status, nor to remove any publicly owned lands from a national-forest status.
