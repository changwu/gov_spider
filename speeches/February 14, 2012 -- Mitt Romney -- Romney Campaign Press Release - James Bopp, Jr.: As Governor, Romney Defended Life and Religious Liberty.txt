He vetoed bills; he fought in Massachusetts to reverse and not include in the healthcare plan the denial of conscience of healthcare providers—the very fight we're in right now with the Obama Administration—Romney took the side of religious liberty and pro-life." —RNC Committeeman James Bopp, Jr.

JOHN MCCASLIN: "I also want to point that, as a constitutional scholar, that you are an RNC committee member. You have written an open letter, just in the last week. Mitt Romney certainly liked it because you came out and endorsed the former Massachusetts governor, pointing out that he has fought for social conservative values and you like that, do you not?"
JAMES BOPP: "I do indeed. I think it's really important to judge a politician most importantly by his conduct in office and Governor Romney demonstrated, as governor, what the Massachusetts Citizens for Life called a consistent pro-life position. He vetoed bills; he fought in Massachusetts to reverse and not include in the healthcare plan the denial of conscience of healthcare providers—the very fight we're in right now with the Obama Administration—Romney took the side of religious liberty and pro-life. Yes, I think that he has demonstrated by his conduct and, of course, his words, his sincere conversion to the pro-life cause, and he's fought for it since he's been governor."
