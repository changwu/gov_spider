    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: 2007 Combined Federal Campaign
Admiral Thad W. Allen, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, has agreed to serve as the Honorary National Chairman of the 2007 Combined Federal Campaign. I ask you to enthusiastically support the CFC by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and by exhorting top agency officials around the country to do the same.
The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
GEORGE W. BUSH
