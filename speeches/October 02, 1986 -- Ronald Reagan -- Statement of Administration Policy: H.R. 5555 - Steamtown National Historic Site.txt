    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. McDade (R) Pennsylvania and 24 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5555. Federal management of or financial support for the Steamtown USA site, which is a commercial property, or designation of the area as a National Historic Site, is inappropriate pending completion by the National Park Service of a recently funded study of the advisability of including Steamtown as a unit of the National Park System.
