    In response to President Trump's press conference today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"As the United States closes in on 150,000 dead, and as states across the country consider re-closing parts of their economy, President Trump inexplicably claimed tonight that he's doing a "great job" compared to other countries in the fight against this virus.
"Here's the reality: as other countries open up, parts of America are being forced to shut down again because of President Trump's historic bungling of this crisis. As other countries return to a semblance of normal, Trump's failed leadership has led to soaring infection rates in the United States and has driven COVID-19 related deaths above 1,000 for the first time since early June.
"The fact is that America now has a worse COVID-19 outbreak than any of its peers, and Trump is continually making it worse by refusing to do what we need to do to get it under control — even going so far as attempting to block badly-needed money for expanded testing capacity.
"With more lives being taken each day and with more and more families suffering under the incredible financial burden imposed by this virus, this is not the time for President Trump to pat himself on the back. We know what we need to do to beat this virus, and for months now Vice President Biden has laid out the steps we must take to do so — the time for President Trump's complacency is over, and the time to act is now."
