Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that Colorado Springs Mayor Lionel Rivera has endorsed his candidacy for President of the United States. Mayor Rivera will play an important role in expanding grassroots support for Governor Romney in Colorado, in addition to the nation's Hispanic community as a member of Romney for President's National Hispanic Steering Committee.
Making today's announcement, Mayor Rivera said, "Mitt Romney possesses the real-world business experience our nation needs to remain the world's economic superpower and to get Washington's fiscal house in order. As we face economic challenges at home and abroad, America needs someone like Mitt Romney who understands why jobs come and why they go and would work to reduce the tax burden on taxpayers and businesses. His experience running a business, the 2002 Olympics and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is a resume that would dwarf Senators Clinton or Obama in November."
Welcoming Mayor Rivera's support, Governor Romney said, "I am honored to have Lionel Rivera's endorsement and welcome him to our strong team in Colorado. As an experienced businessman and Mayor of Colorado Springs, he has devoted his life to creating jobs and helping seniors, families and businesses manage their finances. I look forward to working with Mayor Rivera as the Colorado caucuses approach."
