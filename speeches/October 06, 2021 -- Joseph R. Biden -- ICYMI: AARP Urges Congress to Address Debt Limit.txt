    Today, AARP joined a growing list of community organizations, state and local officials, and private sector leaders to implore Congress to take timely action to address the debt limit "debt in order to protect Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries as well the economic health of the nation."
AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins wrote in a letter to Congressional leadership: "Millions of older Americans rely every day on their Social Security and Medicare benefits and deserve reassurance that the benefits they have worked over a lifetime to earn are secure." The letter continues, "If no agreement is reached soon, they may not receive their Social Security checks and may lose access to their health care."
Jenkins emphasized that "United States government has never defaulted on its debt, and U.S. Treasury bonds are widely considered one of the safest - if not the safest - investments in the world. Honoring the full faith and credit of the United States is a core value of our country and fundamental to the economic security of all Americans, not just older Americans."
