    Senator Hillary Clinton released the following statement about the devastating wildfires that have been raging through Southern California:
"I have been following the news about the wildfires that are affecting seven counties in Southern California. My heart and prayers go out to the families who have been displaced, have lost their homes, businesses or worse â€“ have lost a loved one to these ravaging wildfires."
"My thoughts are also with the thousands of brave firefighters and first responders who are risking their lives in battling the flames and helping the victims. We are praying for your safety."
