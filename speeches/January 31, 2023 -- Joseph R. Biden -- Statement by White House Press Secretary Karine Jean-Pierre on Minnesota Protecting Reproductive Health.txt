    Today, with Governor Tim Walz's signature, Minnesota has codified the protections of Roe into law, the first state legislature to do so in 2023.
Americans overwhelmingly support a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, as so clearly demonstrated last fall when voters turned out to defend access to abortion â€“ including for ballot initiatives in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont.
While Congressional Republicans continue their support for extreme policies including a national abortion ban, the President and Vice President are calling on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law. Until then, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue its work to protect access to abortion and support state leaders in defending women's reproductive rights. In addition to codifying reproductive rights into state law, state leaders across the country are taking steps to protect patients and their health care providers, ensure access to care through expanded funding and training, strengthen privacy protections, and expand access to contraception.
