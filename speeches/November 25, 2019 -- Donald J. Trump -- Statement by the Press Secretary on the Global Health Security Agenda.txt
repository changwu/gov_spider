    The White House has released the annual report, "Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda: Results and Impacts of U.S. Government Investments," which illustrates that the United States continues to elevate global health security as a national and global priority.
The Trump Administration will continue strengthening the global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, as demonstrated by the May 2019 release of the first U.S. Global Health Security Strategy.  The Strategy seeks to expand global health infrastructure, improve international resilience, and strengthen national defenses against biothreats to the American homeland, including by building capacity for governments to comply with their obligations under the International Health Regulations (2005).
This report details the results and progress achieved through United States investments in global health security, including efforts that enhance the global capacity to respond to and contain outbreaks of high-threat diseases such as Ebola, Zika, Rift Valley fever, and pandemic influenza.
The President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2020 proposes resources specifically dedicated to protecting the United States and its partners abroad from deadly infectious disease threats. The United States Government remains a strong proponent of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and a leader in promoting health security.
