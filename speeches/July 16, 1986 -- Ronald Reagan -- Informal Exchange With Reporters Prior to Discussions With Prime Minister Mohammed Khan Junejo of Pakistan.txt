    Q. Mr. President, are you going to negotiate a new test ban treaty with the Soviets, as they have said today?
The President. I'm not going to take any questions hereâ€”any answers at this meeting. There will be plenty of time. We'll be talking about that.
The President. Anything we do is in our national security interest.
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, does your country have the atomic bomb?
The Prime Minister. I think we'll talk later on on that, as the President has earlier mentioned to you.
