The 30-second spot, titled "Bolder," will air statewide and comes as new polling shows the race between Sanders and Clinton tightening in the Empire State.
"New York â€” what makes it think bigger? Go bolder?" asks the narrator in the new spot. "You do."
The ad highlights Sanders' support for a $15 federal minimum wage, his plan to provide tuition-free public college and his commitment to reforming a broken criminal justice system.
"Values forged in New York," the narrator goes on to say of Sanders over footage from a recent rally in the South Bronx where 18,500 cheering New Yorkers gathered. "Brooklyn born. Native son who knows what we know: we are all in this together."
In March, a poll conducted by Emerson College showed Clinton leading Sanders 71 to 23 percent in New York. The same poll conducted last week saw Clinton's lead shrink by 30 points, with Sanders at 38 percent to Clinton's 56.
