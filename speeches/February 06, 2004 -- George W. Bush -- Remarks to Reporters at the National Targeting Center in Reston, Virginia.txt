    I'm glad I came here to the National Targeting Center. This is a building full of modern technology and hard-working people. People here are working incredibly long hours to better secure the homeland, and I am here to thank them for their service to our country.
A lot of our citizens really don't know the extent to which our Government and many of the employees are really working hard. Here I've learned—I've seen how we are able to mate information with terrorist lists or information with potentially dangerous cargo so we can spread valuable information throughout the country at ports of entry or border crossings.
It's a fascinating place. It's a place where after 9/11 we grew, grew with getting the very best programs and programmers and computers to keep us better protected. I really want to thank the people here.
On another front, I'm pleased, obviously, with the new job growth. I have been saying that this economy looks pretty strong, and today 112,000 new jobs were created last month—a report that 112,000 new jobs were created last month. And that's good. Things are getting better. There is more to do, but this economy is growing in strength, and I'm obviously pleased with that.
Thank you all for coming.
