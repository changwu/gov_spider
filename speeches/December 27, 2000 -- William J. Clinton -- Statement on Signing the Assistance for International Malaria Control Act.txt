    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 2943, the "Assistance for International Malaria Control Act." In doing so, however, I note that section 405(b) of the Act purports to restrict the President's constitutional authority to appoint "Officers of the United States" by requiring that individuals be appointed to the Pacific Charter Commission only "after consultation" with specified members of the Congress and by requiring that not more than four of the appointees "may be affiliated with the same political party." Because the work of the Commission may interfere with the constitutional authority vested in the President to conduct foreign affairs, the restrictions in section 405(b) are constitutionally problematic and I therefore construe these restrictions to be precatory only.
