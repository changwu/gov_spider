    It gives me great pleasure to sign into law H.R. 1046, the "Veterans' Compensation Rate Amendments of 1991."
Our Nation provides compensation and other monetary benefits to service-disabled veterans and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits to the survivors of those who died as a result of military service to our country.
H.R. 1046 provides a 3.7 percent increase in compensation and DIC benefits effective December 1, 1991. Nearly 2.2 million Armed Forces veterans and their dependents will benefit from the 3.7 percent increase in compensation benefits. In addition, the same increase will be provided to the 277,000 surviving spouses and 37,000 children who receive DIC benefits.
As a Nation, we are ever mindful of the special debt that we owe those veterans who unselfishly gave of themselves to assure the continued safety and greatness of this country. The freedoms and liberty that we enjoy as citizens of this country depend on the men and women in our Armed Forces. The measure that I sign today bears witness to our gratitude and continued commitment to those who served our country. It demonstrates that the American people will not forget the valuable contribution that our veterans made to this Nation.
