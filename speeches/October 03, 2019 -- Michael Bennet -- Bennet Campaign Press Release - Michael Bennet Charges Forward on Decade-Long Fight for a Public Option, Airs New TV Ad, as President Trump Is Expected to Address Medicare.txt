    New TV Ad Highlights Bennet's Health Care Record
DENVER — Bennet for America today released its third television ad in Iowa highlighting Michael Bennet's decade-long fight to achieve universal coverage with a public option, as President Donald Trump prepares to deliver a speech on Medicare.
"Donald Trump is the first president in history to take health care away from millions of Americans and has proposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid by billions of dollars. His hypocrisy knows no bounds," Bennet said.
"Democrats are the party for universal coverage, not ripping health care away from people. We must protect and build on the Affordable Care Act to cover everyone and lower costs. A public option like my Medicare-X plan is the best and quickest way to do that.
"This race is going to be won on the issue of health care. We need a Democratic nominee with an agenda that helps us not only defeat Trump but also take back the Senate and hold the House. Democrats in 2018 won in swing states running on a public option. We should follow their playbook and play offense — not defense with Medicare for All."
