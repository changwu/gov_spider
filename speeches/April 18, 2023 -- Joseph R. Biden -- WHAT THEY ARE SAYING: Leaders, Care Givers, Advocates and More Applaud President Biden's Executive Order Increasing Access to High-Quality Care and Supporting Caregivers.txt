    Today, President Biden Signed an executive order to expand access to affordable, high-quality care and provide support for care workers and family caregivers. This executive order, which includes more than 50 directives for agencies across the government, is the most comprehensive set of executive actions any President has ever taken to make care more affordable and accessible for hardworking families and further support care workers and family caregivers.
The President believes investing in care is an investment in the future of America's families, workforce, and economy. That is why President Biden's economic agenda aims to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out by transforming care in this country.
See below for how congressional leaders, family caregivers, people with disabilities, long-term care workers, early educators, veterans, aging advocates, and more responded: 
Congressional Leaders:
Massachusetts Congresswoman and Minority Whip Katherine Clark: "No family should be forced to choose between caring for their loved ones and putting food on the table. No care worker should have to take home less than a living wage. And no business should lose dedicated employees because they can't find care for their family members. Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration's unprecedented executive actions today, more Americans across the country will enjoy the dignity and financial security they deserve. Millions of parents, caregivers, educators, and veterans will have access to the affordable, high-quality care they need to get by ? while our economy will have the foundation it needs to thrive. Democrats understand that the care economy has always been a vital piece of our nation's infrastructure ? that care work enables all other work. Since day one, President Biden has put working families front and center, and House Democrats will continue to champion solutions that put people over politics: lower costs for parents, quality care for kids, and livable wages for care workers."

Congressional Progressive Caucus: "As the COVID-19 pandemic made abundantly clear, care workers are essential to our economy and to the health and wellbeing of all our communities. But for too long, child care and home care have been unaffordable, inaccessible, and care workers dramatically undervalued and ...] Today, President Biden rightfully recognized that well-paid, experienced care workers are central to ensuring a competitive and fair economy, and that access to affordable, quality care services are necessary for every family to thrive. [...]" [Statement, 4/18/23]
Virginia Senator Tim Kaine: "Parents are being locked out of the workforce because they can't affordable child care. Critical workers who are passionate about child and long-term care are being forced to leave their field because they can't pay their bills.

Delaware Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester: "We know that lack of access to child care was one of the reasons why nearly 2 million women left the workforce during the pandemic.

Aging Leaders
AARP: "AARP applauds today's Executive Order recognizing the need to make family caregivers a national priority to meet the rapidly growing needs of families across America. Family caregivers are the indispensable backbone of our health and long-term care system, help their loved ones live at home, and they are exhausted. [...] This is a nonpartisan issue that affects us all, but it does not get nearly the recognition or support it deserves. Family caregivers are an essential but often invisible part of almost any care team, who are often in desperate need of more support. [...] Today's Executive Order is an important step forward, building on the first-ever National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers released last fall, the result of years of bipartisan effort in Congress. We stand ready to work with the Administration to advance the important policies to support family caregivers and the long-term workforce. We will continue to work with bipartisan leaders in Congress to advance legislation that can further deliver relief to family caregivers such as paid leave, family caregiver tax credits and other reimbursement programs, and other supports.

In addition, efforts to expand access to affordable, high-quality childcare and provide support for care workers represent a bold approach to improving care across the lifespan. With these actions, the Biden administration is taking historic steps towards implementation of our nation's first-ever National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers and towards addressing the harsh effects? and inequities ? associated with caregiving for millions of American families. These consequences include worsening health outcomes, emotional distress, and economic insecurity, especially among women of color. The National Alliance for Caregiving urges continued action by the administration and Congress to implement the National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers and to advance policies such as paid family and medical leave that can help making caregiving more sustainable, dignified, and equitable for America's 53 million family caregivers."

These steps must be met with Congressional commitments to provide federal funding for child care in the U.S. to reach its fullest potential. [Statement, 4/18/23]
Sarah Rittling, Executive Director, First Five Years Fund: "The president's message tonight was clear: Congress should prioritize child care and early learning and send a bill lowering families' costs to his desk for signature. President Biden understands that the high cost and limited supply of child care and pre-K has held working families back for too long. We have an opportunity to provide relief to parents and build an early learning system that meets the needs of families, providers, and our economy.[...]The good news is that we have never been closer to passing strong, federal legislation to fortify America's child care and early learning sector. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress and heed the President's call this evening to enact these desperately-needed reforms and investments." [Statement, 4/18/23]

There is no denying that our nation's child care system is broken and in need of extraordinary efforts to guarantee every baby has the opportunity to access high-quality child care that will prepare them to learn and grow. We call on Congress to work with the Administration to build on these executive actions. A first step is continuing to support investments that sustain child care supply and lower costs for families, including the stabilization funding expiring this year, while working towards enacting comprehensive policies to guarantee access to high-quality child care and early learning opportunities." [Statement, 4/18/23]
National Indian Child Care Association: "Too many families and individuals struggle to access the affordable, high-quality care they need. [...] President Biden believes that we must secure significant new federal investments to transform care in this country. That's why he and Vice President Harris called for investments to support high-quality, affordable child care, preschool, and long-term care in their fiscal year 2024 budget.

A key element to this fight is enhancing wages, benefits, and job conditions for direct support workers who provide the necessary services to ensure community integration. Individuals in this workforce, who are predominantly disabled women of color, must often work multiple jobs with no benefits to make ends meet.

Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of teachers: "Every family has a need for child care, elder care and everything in between. Yet care is both very expensive and not readily available, and caregivers rarely secure a living wage or decent working conditions. That's why what the Biden-Harris administration did today was so important. The president recognized the critical work of the caregivers today in issuing the most comprehensive set of executive actions any president has ever taken to improve care for hard-working families: lowering costs for child care, increasing pay and benefits for Head Start and child care workers, improving working conditions for those caring for our loved ones in nursing homes, supporting family caregivers and supporting the rights of people doing this essential work to have union protections on the job.

Liz Shuler, President, AFL-CIO: "Today's executive order reinforces why President Biden is leading the most pro-worker administration in our nation's history. As working families continue to face rising costs and fewer options for quality care, these actions come at a critical time. They will help to address the growing crisis in our care system and give working families some much-needed relief. [...] We can no longer afford to ignore this crisis, and we are glad the administration has taken definitive action to tackle this problem head on.

Today's executive actions are an encouraging sign that we are closer than ever to a society that truly values the contributions and sacrifices of working families and caregivers who are vital to our economy. While we commend the Administration for using every tool available to expand access to child care and long-term care, it can't fix these problems alone. We need Congress to enact policy solutions that will fix the care crisis, including on child care, paid family and medical leave, and long-term care, and that will support workers who provide care. For too long, families have endured crushing financial burdens due to lack of care options. These same families and care workers are the backbone of our entire economy. We cannot afford to wait" [Statement, 4/18/23]

This Executive Order puts the full weight of our federal government behind solutions to some of the most debilitating problems of our time. It will help address the child care crisis that has driven so many moms out of the workforce. [...] Care makes all work possible and holds up our economy. We applaud the Biden/Harris administration actions today. [...]" [Statement, 4/18/23]

This morning, the White House took yet another historic step toward strengthening our care economy and ensuring millions of Americans can meet the growing demand for care for their families and loved ones. President Biden's Executive Order will expand affordable care services for families ? including home-based care, child care, and long-term care ? and ensure care workers and domestic workers ? who are disproportionately Black, Latinx, AAPI, Indigenous, and immigrant women ? have access to quality jobs that afford them the respect and the pay needed to care for themselves and their families.

The action underscores the administration's deep commitment to building a care infrastructure that has never existed in the United States, but which families of all backgrounds desperately need. The Biden-Harris administration knows all too well the limitations of what can be achieved through executive action in the absence of Congress approving significant new public investments in care, yet the administration nevertheless worked tirelessly and developed outside-the-box solutions that will make a meaningful difference for families and care providers. Now, it's up to members of Congress to take the same bold, creative approach to build a domestic care economy that truly values care and caregivers." [Statement, 4/18/23]

Patrick Gaspard, President & CEO, Center for American Progress: "From child care workers to home health aides to family caregivers, care workers allow parents to work, disabled people to live independently, and aging Americans to remain in the comfort of their own communities. But despite the essential role they play in society and the economy, care workers have long been taken for granted. Care workers, who are overwhelmingly women and disproportionately women of color, receive substandard pay and little respect. President Biden's executive actions are an important step toward reflecting the value of care workers for communities across the country and will help expand access to high-quality child care, reduce costs for struggling families, and partner with apprenticeship programs, unions, and employers to help care workers advance their careers, while also protecting the rights of both caregivers and people receiving care. Biden's actions today will be a leap toward dignity for all." [Statement, 4/18/23]
