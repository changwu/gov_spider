    DES MOINES, IAâ€“ As momentum on the Clinton campaign continues to build, Iowans for Hillary today announced the endorsement of three notable Iowa labor leaders and AFL-CIO board members, Sandy Opstvedt, IBEW Iowa State Conference President and DNC member; Midge Slater, District Staff Representative for the Communications Workers of America and women's activist; and Deb Groene, Business Manager/Secretary Treasurer of Iowa, Nebraska and Western Illinois District Council 81 of IUPAT.
The wave of support comes on the heels of a five-day, 99 county blitz of Iowa and the endorsement of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.
"Hillary Clinton is an agent of change who is committed to rebuilding the middle class and our economy," said Opstvedt. "Hillary works for the American values that I cherish. I am choosing to stand for Hillary and caucus for her on January 3rd because I know she will stand for me and all Iowans as President."
"I support Hillary Clinton because she believes hard working Americans are the backbone of our country," said Slater. "No other candidate has the strength and experience to turn our country around and bring the change we need."
"We are supporting Hillary Clinton because she recognizes that America was built on the middle class," said Groene. "We are confident she will make decisions with Iowa's working families in mind. She is the only candidate with the strength and experience to enact the change America really needs."
Hillary has made a career of advocating for families and believes our country is still one of innovation, leadership, and working people. Her blueprint to rebuild the economy will strengthen unions, ensure our trade laws work for all Americans and provide quality, affordable health care to every American.
