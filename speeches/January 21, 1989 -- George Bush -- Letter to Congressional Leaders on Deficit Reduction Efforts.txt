    Dear XXXXX:
Yesterday, in my Inaugural Address, I suggested that together we should begin the process of working to achieve a deficit reduction plan -- and that we should do so soon. I had previously stated that I would lead such an effort on behalf of the Executive branch and that I would begin the process promptly upon taking office.
In accord with that commitment and our discussions, I extend to you today an invitation to join me in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, January 24. At that meeting, I would hope we could discuss how best to proceed toward deficit reduction. I would also like to take the opportunity to follow up on suggestions made by you and your colleagues on ways we can move towards effective bipartisan support for our foreign policy.
In addition, I would like to confirm my request, which you indicated could be honored, for the opportunity to address a joint session of the Congress on Thursday, February 9.
Again, let me say how much I look forward to our working together on these critical issues. I am sure the American people expect that concerns of such national import should be tackled in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation, and am hopeful that we may prove worthy of the confidence they have placed in us.
Sincerely,
George Bush
