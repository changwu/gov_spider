(LOUISVILLE, KY) July 15, 2016 â€” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made the follow statement on the announcement that Governor Mike Pence of Indiana has been selected to serve as Donald Trump's running mate.
"Today, Donald Trump made a smart decision by selecting Governor Mike Pence to be his Vice Presidential running mate.
"The last eight years have been really tough for average Americans. We are still stuck in the worst economic recovery since World War II. ISIL and other terror groups continue to act out their evil agenda worldwide. We know that Hillary Clinton would be another four years of the same failed policies that brought us such disappointment at home and abroad.
"Donald Trump and Mike Pence can lead our nation in a new direction and begin to correct the mistakes and mismanagement they will inherit from the Obama Administration.
"Pence is a principled conservative, man of faith, and talented messenger for Republican ideas. Mike's leadership in Indiana and Congress make him more than ready for the position of Vice President. His addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a Republican in the White House and deny a third term for President Obama's liberal agenda.
"It is time for Hillary Clinton to be held accountable. She has failed the American people throughout her career. Our nation needs new leadership, and I'm confident Trump and Pence can provide it. I wish Mike and Karen the best of luck as they begin their new campaign.
