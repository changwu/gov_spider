    LAS VEGAS â€“ A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Monday that he has the best record on the environment of any candidate running for president.
"Bernie's record on the environment is unbeatable. He has proposed the boldest legislation to combat climate change. Sen. Barbara Boxer, the former environment committee chairman, called their bill on climate change 'the gold standard.' He was a leader in the fight to block the Keystone pipeline. He has passed legislation to promote energy efficiency and he has championed proposals to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable and renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biofuels," said Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman.
"That's why he was endorsed by Friends of the Earth. That's why Bill McKibben called him 'the most aggressive voice in the Senate' on climate issues. That's why he has a 95 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters. The league agreed with former Sen. Clinton only 82 percent of the time, so its endorsement is based on something other than the merits," Briggs added.
