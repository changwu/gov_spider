    Chicago, IL - The Obama for America campaign today announced that Pedro R. Pierluisi of Puerto Rico has endorsed Senator Barack Obama for President. Mr. Pierluisi is the New Progressive Party's candidate for the office of Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico to the United States Congress in the upcoming November 2008 elections. Pierluisi previously served as the Secretary of Justice (Attorney General) in Puerto Rico and is a distinguished attorney with 23 years of experience.
"The role of Puerto Rico in American history cannot be underestimated," Obama said. "Puerto Ricans have fought with distinction in every war since World War I, and both Congress and the President have an obligation to help Puerto Rico decide its future status. Working in conjunction with distinguished leaders like Pedro Pierluisi, I will work to give a voice to the 4 million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico and enable them to determine the course of their political future. "
"Senator Obama promises statehooders in Puerto Rico, indeed all Puerto Ricans, that he will honor his responsibility as President in assisting the people of Puerto Rico in resolving their status issue. Moreover, he vows to honor our people's decision by supporting our preference for statehood, if that is what we choose," Pierluisi added.
