    (Santa Fe, NM) â€“ Today Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement with regard to actions by the US Department of Transportation to lobby members of Congress and Governors against California's request for a waiver under the Clean Air Act. That waiver would allow California and twelve other states to enforce tough standards to reduce vehicle pollutions.
"The allegations that US Department of Transportation staff lobbied members of Congress, and indirectly Governors, to oppose state efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are serious," said Governor Bill Richardson. "The Department of Transportation should be working with states to address the problem of global warming, instead of lobbying for corporate interests to preserve the status quo and block bold efforts by Governors to make real progress against air pollution."
California has waited for a year and a half for a decision from the EPA. New Mexico and at least twelve other states are also waiting for that decision before adopting new carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction standards for new vehicles. These new standards would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico by approximately 30 percent over the next eight years.
"If this administration refuses to fight global warming, then they should at least stop bureaucratic foot-dragging and let states continue to lead the fight against global warming," stated Governor Richardson.
On April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court (Massachusetts v. EPA; U.S., No. 05-1120) indicated that EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
Adopting the regulations was a unanimous recommendation of Governor Richardson's Climate Change Advisory Group for reducing transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. See http://www.nmclimatechange.us/. At least twelve states already have adopted the standards, and six more (including New Mexico) are considering adoption. The New Mexico Environment Department will hold public meetings on the program.
