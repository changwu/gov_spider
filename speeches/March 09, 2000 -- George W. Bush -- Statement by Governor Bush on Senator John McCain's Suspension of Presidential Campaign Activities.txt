    I appreciated so very much John's gracious remarks about me and my family. I appreciate so very much him passing on his good will and good wishes my way and I thank him for that, I want to congratulate John for fighting a good fight. He campaigned hard for what he believes and I appreciate so very much his willingness to enter the arena and talk about issues that were dear to his heart. I know the competition bas made me a better candidate. I know the competition is going to help us win the White House come November. I also agree with John McCain about the need to reform Washington, D.C. In order to reform Washington, D.C., it is important to get rid of Clinton-Gore.
