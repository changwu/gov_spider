(House Rules)
(Rep. Guthrie, R-KY)
The Affordable Care Act made significant improvements to our Nationâ€™s health care system that are helping to improve individuals' health and give American families and small business owners more control of their own health care. These important changes include: ending the worst practices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing down the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget deficits.
As the President indicated in the State of the Union, the Administration is eager to work with the Congress to improve the Affordable Care Act by making care better or more affordable. H.R. 1216 does not advance the key objectives of the Affordable Care Act or offer alternative solutions for meeting these important objectives. Rather than making refinements to improve the law, the bill simply proposes to convert the Affordable Care Act's appropriations for graduate medical education in qualified teaching health centers to an authorization of appropriations, and rescind unobligated balances. These funds promote training of medical residents in qualifying health centers, strengthening the health care workforce, and supporting an increased number of primary care medical and dental residents trained in community-based settings across the country.
The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the Affordable Care Act. However, the Administration will strongly oppose legislation that attempts to erode the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.
