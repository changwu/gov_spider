  A Proclamation

In our country today there are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 young people afflicted with cystic fibrosisâ€”a genetic disease that will prevent most of them from reaching full adulthood. Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease that strikes American children; its cause and cure are still a mystery, and its effects pose formidable obstacles to normal activity throughout its victims' brief lives.
In the past twenty-five years, medical research has achieved measurable success in treating the symptoms of cystic fibrosis and in extending the lives of children born with the disease. The promise of further advances and the courage demonstrated each day by the suffering victims spur intensified research efforts.
With continuing attention to the many scientific questions yet to be answered and improved public awareness of the benefits of early diagnosis of this disease, there is good cause for optimism that cystic fibrosis can be overcome. The combined efforts of dedicated researchers and volunteers committed to the challenge of cystic fibrosis are a wellspring of hope for patients and their families, and the millions of Americans who may unknowingly carry the genetic trait that produces cystic fibrosis.
Acknowledging the progress of the last twenty-five years, and recognizing the compelling need to expand on past efforts to combat this fatal disorder, the Congress has, by Senate Joint Resolution 186, designated September 19 through 25, 1982, as National Cystic Fibrosis Week, declaring it as a time to consider the profound impact of the disease and the growing sense of hopefulness for the future of cystic fibrosis victims.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 19, 1982, as National Cystic Fibrosis Week and call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 24th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
