    Rosalynn and I extend our sincere sympathy to Marion Bolin and the people of Arizona on the death of Governor Wesley Bolin.
Wesley Bolin was part of the public scene in Arizona longer than almost anyone else in the State's history. He was elected constable of the West Phoenix Precinct in 1938 and had held statewide office for the last 30 years. In that time his State changed dramatically, but he was unchanged in his integrity, his warm spirits, and his dedication to duty and to the values he believed in.
Before being appointed Governor last fall, he had been elected to 13 consecutive terms as secretary of state, and he had become one of the most popular and well-respected men in the State.
The last week of his life was a time of particular fulfillment for Governor Bolin, as he came to Washington to represent his State at the National Governors' Conference. He dined with us at the White House and danced with Rosalynn to begin the evening's entertainment. We join the many others who knew the warmth of his personality and are saddened by his death.
