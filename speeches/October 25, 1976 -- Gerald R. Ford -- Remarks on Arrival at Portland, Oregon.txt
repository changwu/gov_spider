    Thank you very much, Bob Packwood:
Really, I feel very humble coming to the great State of Oregon and to have the endorsement of Edith Green, the endorsement of Mrs. Tom McCall, and the endorsement of such a prestigious group as you see on my right.
I think Oregon is extremely wall-served by the two fine Senators that it has in Mark Hatfield and Bob Packwood. Of course, it was great to see my good friend, Wendell Wyatt.
I'm delighted to be here and have an opportunity to come back and renew acquaintances in the State of Oregon. And I can assure you that in the remaining days of this campaign, I will try, in a very constructive way, to point out the significance of this election, the fundamental differences that exist, and why, in my judgment, there ought to be a selection of Jerry Ford and Bob Dole as our leaders for the next 4 years. I can assure you that what we've done in the past 2 years will simply be a forerunner of the kind of progress that I think America can make and will make in the first 4 years of our third century.
Nothing was more inspirational to me than that wonderful Fourth of July, when America celebrated its Bicentennial. I found all over America--and it was reported by the news media, I think, with great enthusiasm because it showed a change--America was healed, America was on the move, and we all look forward to a great opportunity to do the things in the next 4 and the next 100 years that must be done to make that vision of our forefathers a reality.
So, I thank Edith. She has taken on the leadership with two others, George Feldman and Dom DiMaggio, to get all the Independents and Democrats who feel, as I do, that this country does have an opportunity to do those wonderful things that our forefathers gave us the opportunity to do. I just couldn't come to Oregon and get a finer display of the kind of support that I want, and I thank each and every one of them from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you.
