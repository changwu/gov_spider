    The President today announced his intention to nominate financial expert Donald R. Wurtz as Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Education. Wurtz is director of the General Accounting Office unit charged with cracking down on high-risk areas of waste, abuse, and fraud in the Federal Government and has worked extensively on problems involving the Education Department's guaranteed student loan program.
