Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who has done nothing but betray you for 47 long years - selling out to lobbyists, China, big pharma & foreign countries. He will stab you in the back. He only cares about political power & he will use that power to hurt you & enrich his cronies!  https://t.co/8B9kZ5sdEJ Retweets: 21598Favorites: 87283
