Tim Scott: I was a disillusioned young man, growing up in a single-parent household, mired in poverty.
I wondered if the American Dream was real for a kid like me. I can stand before you today, and say the dream is alive, it is well, and it is healthy.
I have the good fortune to have a mom who worked 16-hour days, making sure we had food on our tables. She taught me that if you're able-bodied in America, you work.
If you take out a loan, you pay it back.
If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. And if God made you a man, you play sports against men.
I'm Tim Scott. I'm asking for your vote, and if you're living in Iowa, I'm asking you to caucus for me.
