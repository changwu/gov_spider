In-town pool report #3
After doing a live stand-up interview from the briefing room with Fox Business Network's Stu Varney about coronavirus, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, did a short gaggle with reporters. He said,that the US economy remains strong, people shouldn't panic and the Trump administration was not stifling the flow of government information about the virus..
"Given what we know factually, it looks to me like the market had gone too far."
"I just think everybody, whether you're an investor or whether you're an ordinary mainstream person, people should not overreact."
"The president has taken rapid-fire unprecedented actions to help protect in the event of an emergency or further deterioration."
Kudlow would not say if the president is considering suspending tariffs on China but said the White House is not considering any "precipitous action right now".
"I just don't think anybody ought to panic right now. We're going to stay the course on our policies."
On reports that all coronavirus communications need to be funneled through Pence's office, Kudlow said the administration was "just trying to coordinate our messages."
"No one's being stifled. No one's being told what to say."
"There's a big difference between stifling and coordinating."
Kudlow also said the G7 meetings in the US, both the finance ministers and the leaders meetings, are still on.

In-town pool report #3a -- correction
On this quote from Kudlow, the tense was wrong. Here's the correct version.
"Given what we know factually, it looks to me like the market has gone too far."

Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. President Trump expressed his condolences and condemned yesterday's attack that killed Turkish personnel in Syria. President Trump reaffirmed his support for Turkey's efforts to de-escalate the situation in northwest Syria and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. The two leaders agreed that the Syrian regime, Russia, and the Iranian regime must halt their offensive before more innocent civilians are killed and displaced.

In-town pool report #7
POTUS walked out of the Oval Office at 4:30 and spoke with reporters for about 15 minutes. He spoke about coronavirus efforts saying the US has only 15 cases and they are getting better "very rapidly." He said his decision to close the borders was the major factor in containing the virus in the US and accused some Democrats and the media of politicizing the virus situation. He lifted off forAndrews at 4:41 pm. More quotes to come.



February 28, 202016:59 

In-town pool report #8
More from POTUS on the South Lawn.
"A lot of people are getting better, very much better," POTUS said of US residents with coronavirus. He said there were still only 15 cases and we took in "some great American people and citizens" from Japan "and they're getting better very rapidly."
"Essentially we've only had 15 and a lot of that's because...we made a decision very early to clluse up our borders from certain areas of the world."
"Some countries are doing well, some countries are not doing well, you can see that for yourself. A lot of things are happening, we're very well organized, we have great talent, great doctors, great everyone. There's tremendous spirit, a lot of spirit."
"There have been no deaths in the United States at all. A lot of that's attributable to the fact that we closed the border very early otherwise it could be a different story."



February 28, 202017:07 

In-town pool report #9
More POTUS on his White House departure.
On coronavirus, "We're ordering a lot of supplies....we're working on cures and getting some very good results. As you know they're working as rapidly as they can on a vaccine for the future."
About why people are nervous.
"It's the unknown, you know, they look at it and they say how long will this last. I think they're not very happy with the Democrat candidates when they see them and I think that has an impact."
"But I think it's basically the unknown a little bit but I feel very confident and our people are doing a fantastic job and again we haven't seen an increase and people are getting better. Almost everybody that we see is getting better."
"I'm spending a lot of time on it just in coordination. Mike Pence is doing a great job. Dr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci is great...Alex Azar is right on top of it. We're all watching it very closely. We don't want any bad surprises."



February 28, 202017:14 

in-town pool report #10
Asked if he thinks the coronavirus situation is a hoax, POTUS said, "I think that media is, yes. I think that CNN is a very disreputable network. I think they're doing everything they can to instill fear in people and I think it's ridiculous and I think they're very disreputable. And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot about this. The fact is, I made one decision that was a very important decision, and that was to close our country to a certain area of the world that was relatively heavily infected, and because of that we're talking about 15 who seem to be all getting better, one is questionable. Had that decision not be made it could be a much different story. So some people are giving us credit... for that and some people aren't. But the only ones that aren't they don't mean it, it's political. It's politics."
POTUS then walked toward Marine One and answered another question about the Federal Reserve but your pooler was too far away to hear his comments. Check the TV footage on that.
