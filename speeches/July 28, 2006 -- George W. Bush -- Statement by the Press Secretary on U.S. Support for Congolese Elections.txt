    The United States strongly supports the electoral process underway in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The July 30 election will help to establish an inclusive democracy and promote regional peace and stability. We call upon all parties to refrain from violence and to use this historic opportunity for free and fair elections to elect a government accountable to the people. We look forward to deepening our ties with the Congolese people as we meet the challenges and share in the opportunities of the future.
