    President Donald J. Trump is elevating Sarah Sanders to the role of White House Press Secretary. Sanders will serve as the President's principal spokesperson and head of the White House Press Office.
"As Deputy Press Secretary, Sarah has done an outstanding job getting my Administration's message out to the American people," said President Trump. "In this new position, she will continue to promote the progress we are making toward the things the people truly care about, like growing our economy, bringing jobs back from overseas, slashing government bureaucracy, and keeping America secure."
"I'm humbled by this honor, and grateful to the President for his confidence in me," said Sanders. "I'm looking forward to working with our new Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci. I have great appreciation and respect for Sean Spicer, who has been more than a colleague, but a true friend and mentor. We've had a tremendous first six months, and I am excited about the opportunity to continue promoting the President's agenda to Make America Great Again."
