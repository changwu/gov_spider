    Dear John:
It is with special regret that I accept, as you have requested, your resignation as Secretary of the Navy, effective upon a date to be determined. In doing so, I want to express my deep gratitude for your superb service to the Navy and the country for the past three years.
From the first days of this Administration, you have brought to your challenging responsibilities a rare combination of managerial skill, sound judgment, and uncommon dedication, giving the men and women of our Navy and Marine Corps the wise leadership they so richly deserve.
As Secretary of the Navy, you have contributed enormously to our national security. I have especially valued your outstanding efforts in helping to carry out our Vietnamization policy, while simultaneously taking the needed steps to modernize our Fleet. The new, bold programs developed under your guidance hold great promise for the future of our naval forces.
You have every reason to take the fullest measure of satisfaction from the splendid work you have accomplished. On behalf of all your friends here in Washington-and your fellow citizens across the nation--I welcome this opportunity to say "Well Done!" and to extend warmest good wishes for your continued success in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable John H. Chafee, Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C. 20350]
