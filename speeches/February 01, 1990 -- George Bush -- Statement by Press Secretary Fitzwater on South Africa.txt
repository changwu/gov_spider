    President Bush has been closely following the situation in South Africa. He believes that President de Klerk has taken a number of courageous and important steps aimed at ending apartheid and moving toward a democratic and nonracial South Africa. Should Mandela be released, President Bush would plan to invite both Mandela and de Klerk separately to meet with him at the White House so President Bush can determine how the United States can best help South Africa move forward toward a nonracial government and society.
