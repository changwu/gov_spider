In-town pool report #1 
Good morning on an overcast Friday at the White House.
Sorry this is coming a little later than usual — law enforcement is blocking off traffic heading towards the White House ahead of anticipated Juneteenth demonstrations. Your pooler saw DC police cars, humvees and fatigued personnel on both 17th and cross streets west of the WH.
Though POTUS currently has no public events on his schedule, I've got a feeling we might have a press briefing added later today. I'll let y'all know as soon as I receive updated guidance.
Kevin Hassett briefly gaggled in the 9:00am hour. Here's video: https://www.c-span.org/video/?473245-1/kevin-hassett-speaks-reporters-wh...
As always, feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions.
