    Lynne and I are deeply saddened by the death of our friend John Robson, the chairman of the Export-Import Bank. John was a strong leader who was committed to making a positive mark on any organization in which he served. He often said it was his duty to "leave a place better than when he came" and at the Ex-Im Bank he was well on his way to accomplishing this task. He was a dear friend of ours and we will miss his friendship, wit, and uncommon decency and dedication.
