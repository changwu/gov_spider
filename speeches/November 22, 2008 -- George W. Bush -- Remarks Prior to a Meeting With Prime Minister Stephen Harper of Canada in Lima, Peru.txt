    President Bush. I'm pleased to be with a good friend and a strong leader, Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It's been a joy to work with him, and we've accomplished a lot together. Relations between the United States and Canada are strong, sometimes complicated, but nevertheless based on common values. I appreciate your candor, your strength of character, and your consistent philosophy. So I'm looking forward to good discussions. I'm looking forward to this APEC; I think it's very important for us to continue to work together during this time of economic turmoil.
I want to thank you for coming to Washington last weekend and thank you for your solid contributionsâ€”[inaudible].
Prime Minister Harper. Well, I appreciate that, Mr. President, and I've appreciated the candor of our relationship; I've appreciated your openness. We've had many things we've agreed on and a few we haven't, but you've always been willing to listen. And Laureen and I certainly wish Laura and you all the best if I don't see you again before the 20th of January.
President Bush. Before forced retirement. [Laughter]
