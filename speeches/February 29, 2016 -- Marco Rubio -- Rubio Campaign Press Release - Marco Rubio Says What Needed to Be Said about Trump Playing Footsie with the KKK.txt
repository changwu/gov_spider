It's exactly this kind of thing that Marco says shows why Trump is dangerous, and a threat to the Republican party and our country. 
So on the campaign trail today, Marco really let Trump have it. Here he is in Loudoun County:

The key line:
"We cannot be the party that refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan."
Later in the day, Marco hit on some of the same themes at a rally outside Richmond:

Here's what he asked the enthusiastic crowd:
"Should the head of the conservative movement, should the Republican nominee be someone who today, like Donald Trump, refused to criticize the Ku Klux Klan?"
"There is no place in the conservative movement for David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, or any sort of hated or bigotry," Marco declared.
