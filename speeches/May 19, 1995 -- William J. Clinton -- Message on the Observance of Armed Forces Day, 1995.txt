    Every year on this day our citizens join in honoring you, the men and women who wear our nation's uniform. You risk your very lives to defend the liberties we hold dear. Americans everywhere recognize your dedication and professionalism, and all of us feel profound respect, pride, and appreciation for our Armed Forces.
As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Allied victory in World War II, everyone on Earth should pause to express heartfelt gratitude to those who fought and sacrificed in that awful conflict. We do no greater honor to the memory of those lost in World War II than to continue their fight against tyranny and oppression everywhere.
Each of you has stood to carry on that fight in this past year. You have been called to serve in lands far from home. You have brought freedom and security to our friends and allies and humanitarian aid to those in need. In Haiti, you helped restore democracy; in the Persian Gulf, you faced down the forces of aggression; and in central Africa, you delivered lifesaving food, water, and medicine. Throughout the year, you maintained the security of our country at home and at posts around the world.
Whether you serve in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, your standards of excellence and your selfless service are models for all Americans. I am proud to salute you for your many extraordinary accomplishments.
BILL CLINTON
