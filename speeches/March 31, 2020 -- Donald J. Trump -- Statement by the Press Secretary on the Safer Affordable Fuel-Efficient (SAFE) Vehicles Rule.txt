    Today, President Donald J. Trump has kept another promise to the American people by releasing the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule that will provide safer and cleaner cars and save American families thousands of dollars in new vehicle costs. As noted by both car companies and consumer advocates, the previous administration's unattainable corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and CO2 emissions standards made new vehicles too expensive for many Americans to afford, forcing them to keep driving their older, more dangerous, and less environmentally friendly vehicles. In addition to solving these serious problems, the SAFE Vehicles Rule will continue to improve United States air quality while also protecting the jobs of our great American autoworkers. President Trump applauds the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency for providing a reality check to radical Green New Deal environmental activists and for delivering the largest deregulatory action of his Presidency.
NHTSA research shows these new realistic standards will, through 2029, result in 2.7 million additional new vehicles sold, 3,300 fewer crash fatalities, 397,000 fewer automobile related injuries, more than 1.8 million fewer vehicles damaged in crashes, and reduced technology costs of between $86 to $126 billion.
