    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, John Edwards for President communications director Chris Kofinis released the following statement in response to Senator Clinton's flip-flop on negotiating with Iran:
"Senator Clinton needs to be honest with the American people about her plans—but on everything from Iran to Iraq to Social Security, it seems she's trying to have it both ways. In July, she criticized those who said they would meet with the leaders of Iran for negotiations without preconditions, calling them 'irresponsible' and 'naïve.' But yesterday, she told New Hampshire voters she'd do just that—negotiate with Iran 'with no conditions.' Now, her spokesman suggests that's not what she meant. But you can't have it both ways—on this or any other issue.
"It is very disappointing that Senator Clinton seems determined to hedge her responses on the issues that matter most to the American people. After six years of the Bush Administration's disastrous foreign policy, the stakes in this election are too high. The American people deserve a president who will tell them the truth and offer straight answers, not flip-flops and political double-speak."
