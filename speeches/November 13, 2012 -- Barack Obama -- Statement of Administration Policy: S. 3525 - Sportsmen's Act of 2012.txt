(Senate)
(Sen. Tester, D-MT, and 14 cosponsors)
The Administration supports S. 3525, the Sportsmen's Act of 2012, which would increase access to public lands for the tens of millions of Americans who participate in hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation and would support the conservation of wildlife and habitat. This legislation, a compilation of bipartisan bills, would promote our recreational hunting, fishing and shooting heritage and would continue a number of key initiatives and public-private partnerships that support conservation of fish and wildlife populations and vital habitat. This bill is consistent with the Administration's commitment under the America's Great Outdoors Initiative to provide opportunities for outdoor recreation, restore critical landscapes and support a robust outdoor economy. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress and with the American people to advance a community-based conservation agenda.
