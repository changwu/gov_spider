In-town pool report #6: Fuller Oval spray comments 
Following up with fuller comments/color from the roughly two-minute Oval spray. Going on the audio sent previously, but again check tape.
President Biden and Chancellor Scholz both wore masks while the pool was in the Oval. Biden waited for the press, which included a large contingent of German media, to assemble before making his brief remarks.
"It's good to have a chance to get to know you more personally," Biden said.
Cleaning up part of a quote from first Oval pool note:
"And, you know, to state the obvious, Germany is one of America's closest allies, working in lockstep," to "further deter Russian aggression in Europe, and to address the challenges posed by China and promote stability to vote in the Western Balkans."
Biden then said: "We then have to take on a pandemic, climate change and many others issues. So we have a lot to talk about."
Biden also said he was looking forward to working with Germany at the G7 summit this year.
Chancellor Scholz then spoke for less than a minute. He started by thanking Biden for the White House invitation.
Scholz said, "I appreciate very much that we have the chance to discuss all the topics you raised. They are very important. We are closest allies and working intensely together."
He ended by saying that "this is necessary for doing the steps that we have to do, for instance, fighting against Russian aggression against Ukraine. So it's an important meeting at a very, very important time."

Foreign pool report POTS German Chancellor 
Bilateral POTUS and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the Oval Office
In his extremely short statement at the beginning of the in meeting with POTUS German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in his trademark low voice that he appreciates the opportunity to discuss all topics of importance, that President Biden mentioned in his statement before from fighting the pandemic to climate change and of course the crisis around Ukraine.
Scholz stated that US and Germany were close allies and that they would fight "Russian aggression" together.
-------------
This is Olaf Scholz's first visit to the White House. The 63-year-old was sworn in as German Chancellor on December 8 of last year. He leads a three-party coalition of his social democratic party SPD, the Greens and the libertarian FDP.
In December he got under criticism at home and abroad when he characterized the North Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany as a mere "private-sector project" despite Russia's threats against Ukraine. Since then the Chancellor said that in terms of possible sanctions everything would on the table.
The German delegation comprises of the Chancellors key advisors Jens Plötner (foreign affairs) and Jörg Kukies (economy) and the government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit plus Emily Haber, German Ambassador to the US.
