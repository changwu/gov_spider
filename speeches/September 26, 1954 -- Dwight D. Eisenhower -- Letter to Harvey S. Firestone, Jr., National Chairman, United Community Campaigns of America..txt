Dear Mr. Firestone:
At the opening of this year's Community Chest and United Fund Campaigns, I extend my most sincere wishes for their overwhelming success.
In this drive our people once again make a concerted voluntary effort to help those among us in illness or in need: children who are sick, the physically handicapped, old people unfriended and alone, those whose suffering in body or mind would otherwise go uncared for, those who would otherwise lack assistance to bring them happier, better lives.
Each person contributing to this assistance can know that he has earned the profound gratitude of those whom he helps. But he has an even greater reward in the inner realization that--as a free individual-he has chosen to show sympathy to fellow human beings. I earnestly hope that the American people will earn these rewards anew by contributing to this year's Community Chest and United Defense Funds with an inspired generosity and a true warmth of heart.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
