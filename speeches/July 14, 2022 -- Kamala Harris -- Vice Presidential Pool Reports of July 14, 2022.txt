VP pool report #3 - VP comments in Orlando
AF2 was wheels down in Orlando at 10:38 AM. The VP deplaned at 10:56 and spoke briefly to pool under the wing about why she's in Florida today.
"When I think about the issue of choice, the President and I feel very strongly that we have a duty and obligation to protect the American people, including American women, and that includes women in Florida."
"Here in Florida, just most recently, a law was passed effective, I believe, July 1, that is going to allow the government to impose its decisions on the women of Florida, instead of giving women the right to choose to make decisions about some of the most personal matters a woman could have to deal with."
"I'm here to speak with these leaders to talk about what we can do together to ensure that we use all that is within our capacity to protect the women of America, which includes women in Florida."

VP pool #4 - Remarks to AKA's 70th Boule
The program began at 11:44 and the VP was introduced at 11:47 to thousands of cheers and yells from AKA sisters here. Will Tweet video if possible.
The crowd is nearly 12,000 (11,979 is the official count) members from all over the country and the world, per VP staff. Everyone is in white, some with pink and green accessories.
On the dais with the VP are 80 members of AKA â€” former international presidents, members of sorority leadership and committee chairs. Pink tables and pink and green decorations framed the stage with a VPOTUS lectern in the middle.
"It was certainly nice of God to create Kamala Harris," her introducer, outgoing AKA International President Dr. Glenda Glover, began.
VP highlights:
"It is so good to be here. I can't even explain how this feels."
"The sisterhood remains a key part of who I am today."
She says she has a signed copy of a book from one of AKA's founders in her West Wing office.
Even when the sorority was founded, she said, 89 people were lynched across the country.
"Our advocacy has been the history of moving the highest levels of government into action."
"We will always fight for what our communities need and the best of who we are as a nation."
In 2020, the VP says AKA sorors showed up for her and President Biden and "you showed up for America."
She mentions her work on the Black maternal health crisis and the summit she held at the White House, plus the work to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage to 12 months. She also spoke about the child tax credit, the work to remove lead from pipes, broadband access, police reform and racial bias in home appraisals.
She talked about AKA's work to raise millions of dollars for HBCUs and the Biden administration's investment in HBCUs.
"As the first Vice President to be a graduate of an HBCU, I'm particularly proud of that."
Big applause when the VP mentions the recent confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
"Thank you sorors, thank you. Because this is the progress that you fought for."
"We must do it again this November," she says to applause.
She called for the removal of the liability shield for gun manufacturers and a renewed assault weapons ban.
"The road to get there, to see it through, is not going to be easy. It's never been easy."
"These so-called leaders in this state and other places across the country making it more difficult for people to vote."
"So-called leaders who are in the process of punishing doctors and criminalizing women who want to make decisions for themselves."
"We need two additional U.S. senators" to protect voting rights, abortion rights, she says, and people up and down the ballot to protect those rights.
She calls on AKA to "continue to activate" and organize coalitions around the country.

VP pool report #5 - Roundtable on reproductive rights
Pool entered the small conference room at 1:44 and the VP was already seated at the head of three tables in a rectangle formation, with Sec. Becerra to her left and five other panelists.
"We collectively agree, as do most Americans, there are some things the government should just not interfere with."
"Many of us also agree that this is not an issue that requires any person to change their faith, or their belief system."
Becerra thanked the VP for coming to Florida where there are people fighting for reproductive rights.
"We at HHS hope to put in action the instructions you and the president have given us."

Background and participants, from a WH Official:

The convening of Florida state legislators in Orlando follows meetings about reproductive rights that the Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders, constitutional law and privacy experts, advocates, Attorneys General, and state legislators from across the country.
During the meeting, the Vice President will convey the Administration's commitment to protecting access to reproductive health care, including abortion access, and she will encourage the legislators to continue fighting to protect reproductive rights in Florida.
