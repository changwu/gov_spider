    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Packard (R) California and 86 others)
The administration would support H.R. 1517 if it were amended to give the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the discretion to establish by regulation the optimum timetable for the installation of collision avoidance systems on commercial aircraft. The FAA has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and is currently evaluating public comments on this matter. Therefore, the administration urges that H.R. 1517 not be considered under suspension of the rules and that it be amended accordingly.
Alternative Position
The administration has no objection to enactment of H.R. 1517.
