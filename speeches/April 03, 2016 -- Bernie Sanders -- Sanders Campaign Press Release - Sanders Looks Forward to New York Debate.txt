    
WAUSAU, Wis. â€“ Bernie Sanders' campaign spokesman Michael Briggs issued the following statement on Sunday on a debate in New York:
"Sen. Sanders has accepted an invitation from NBC News for a Sunday night prime-time debate on April 10. We hope the Clinton campaign also accepts. The April 10 debate date is one of four dates that the Sanders campaign had proposed for a debate with Secretary Clinton before the New York primary election. He is available on April 10, 11, 12 or 13. He looks forward to a debate on any of those days.
"The Clinton campaign disingenuously announced that it had agreed to a debate on another day when it knew very well that Sen. Sanders already had locked in a park permit for a major rally in New York City. Let's get serious. Let's get on with debating the candidates' stands on serious issues affecting New York and the United States."
