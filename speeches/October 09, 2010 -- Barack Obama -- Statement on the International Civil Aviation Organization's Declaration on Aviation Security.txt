    I commend the International Civil Aviation Organization for adopting yesterday's declaration on aviation security, which forges a historic new foundation for aviation security that will better protect our world from evolving terrorist threats. Following the attempted December 25th terrorist attack, at my direction, the Department of Homeland Security has worked with ICAO, our international partners, and representatives ranging from airline CEOs to aviation industry trade associations in an unprecedented effort to strengthen international aviation security. The extraordinary global collaboration demonstrated by the nearly 190 ICAO countries during the ICAO General Assembly in Montreal has helped to bring about a truly 21st-century international aviation security framework that will make air travel safer and more secure than ever before.
