Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
Although there is a long tradition of friendship and cooperation between the United States and Belgium, today's pressing need for free-world solidarity calls for ever-closer ties between our two countries. I am convinced that through our common efforts the partnership which the United States and Belgium have built over the years will continue to serve not only the best interests of our two countries, but the cause of free men everywhere. I have asked Ambassador MacArthur, in whom I place full confidence, to devote his energies to these ends. I am confident that full and frank discussion will strengthen mutual understanding and thus also serve to strengthen the partnership between our two countries. I would like you to know that for our part we will greatly value your views on all matters of mutual interest.
My fellow Americans join me in extending to you congratulations and best wishes on your assumption of the office of Prime Minister.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Excellency Theo M. Lefevre, Prime Minister of Belgium]
