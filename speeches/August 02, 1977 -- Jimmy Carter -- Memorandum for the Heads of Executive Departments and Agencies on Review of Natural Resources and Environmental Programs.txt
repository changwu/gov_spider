    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Comprehensive Review of Natural Resources and Environmental Programs
I have directed my Reorganization Project staff at the Office of Management and Budget to review the organization of all Federal responsibilities for managing natural resources and protecting the environment.
These responsibilities are now dispersed among 8 Departments and numerous agencies, involving 160,000 employees and expenditures of more than $17 billion a year. Other Departments and agencies are involved less directly. There is no way to coordinate their policies and actions. This situation has led to difficulties in managing resources and safeguarding the environment; waste of time and money; confusion to the public; and ineffective coordination of geophysical and environmental research and technology.
This organizational review will seek better ways to set policy, make decisions about resource management and environmental quality, improve research and technical support, and assure consistency in programs.
Its success will depend on active participation by members of Congress, the Federal departments and agencies, State, local and regional officials, interested groups, and individual citizens.
