    Today, Treasury Secretary Yellen penned an op-ed in Yahoo! Finance, in which she argues that President Biden's Build Back Better agenda "will bolster our economic growth and productivity, while bringing down some of the largest cost drivers for American families."
As Secretary Yellen notes: "The Build Back Better agenda…will increase labor force participation because it makes those long-overdue investments in families," she writes. "It expands access to high-quality childcare, provides universal pre-K, and expands the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit — all of which reduce the cost of raising families… This new bill makes community college tuition-free for two years, which will help workers – especially younger ones – better compete in the labor market. And it will help Americans who've never been able to build wealth obtain the most important asset for doing so: the family home."
Addressing skepticism about the size of the proposed investments, she writes, "The crucial question isn't 'What if we make these big investments?" It is: "What if we don't?'"
We are now engaged in the most important economic project in recent history: Repairing the broken foundations of our economy and building something stronger and fairer than what came before."
