    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ The John Edwards for President campaign announced today that all seven members of North Carolina's Democratic Congressional delegation are endorsing Senator John Edwards for President.
The seven North Carolina congressmen endorsing Edwards are Congressman G.K Butterfield (D-1st), Congressman Bob Etheridge (D-2nd), Congressman David Price (D-4th), Congressman Mike McIntyre (D-7th), Congressman Heath Shuler (D-11th), Congressman Mel Watt (D-12th) and Congressman Brad Miller (D-13th).
"I am proud to have the support of these outstanding members of Congress," said Edwards. "They work each and every day to bring North Carolina common sense to Washington and to represent the people of our great state with dignity and honor. I value both their ideas and their friendship and thank them for their support."
Congressman Price endorsed Edwards saying, "The North Carolina delegation unanimously supports John's candidacy because we know his character, leadership ability, and commitment to our country. John's vision for our country is one of opportunity and common sense solutions to the challenges we face. He'll be an effective President, and we look forward to helping put a great North Carolinian in the White House."
Congressman Watt said, "I've known John for years and support his commitment to helping Americans climb the economic ladder. He has been in close contact with poor and working people and has studied the issues that impact them. It's a new way of approaching a presidential campaign - from the bottom up, rather than from the top down - and his success will set a wonderful precedent for how future presidential campaigns are run."
