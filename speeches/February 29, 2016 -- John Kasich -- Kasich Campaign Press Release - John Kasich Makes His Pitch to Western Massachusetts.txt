    The Republican
Looking to shore up support for his Republican presidential run in the final push towards "Super Tuesday," Ohio Gov. John Kasich painted himself as a pragmatic problem-solver as his campaign stopped in Springfield Sunday.
Speaking to hundreds of supporters who crowded a meeting room at the MassMutual Center, the Ohio governor highlighted his political experience, as well as emphasized the differences between himself and other Republican candidates vying for the White House.
Kasich, who characterized himself as a candidate that "gets things done," told voters he won't promise things he doesn't believe he can deliver on if elected president and took aim at members of his party who do...
...If sent to the White House, Kasich said he would focus on policies he can follow through on, like bringing down the corporate tax, saving Social Security and ensuring all combat veterans have access to health care wherever they want it...
He blasted the race's focus on shouting and personal attacks.
"I have never seen a leader — or anybody who's attempting to be a leader — who has to raise their voice and yell and scream," he said. "I think about some of the ones who I have most admired in my lifetime...I never heard Ronald Reagan raise his voice or personally attack anybody that he was engaged with."
...Russell Hubley, of Longmeadow, said he's among those voters tired of the shouting. He praised Kasich's record, as well as the candidate's decision to "not allow himself to get down into the muck."
"We don't need one of those leading this country," Hubley said in an interview.
"He's there to get a job done and not point fingers and he's proved, not only in Ohio, he's been in Washington before, and now no one else can say that."
