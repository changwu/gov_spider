    On April 15, 1947, an African American wearing the number 42 broke baseball's color barrier. Jackie Robinson's courage and skill convinced players, coaches, and fans to judge an athlete by his performance and not the color of his skin. His leadership strengthened America's pastime and strengthened America. Sixty years later, our Nation celebrates Jackie Robinson's accomplishments and his legacy, and we give thanks for his extraordinary life.
