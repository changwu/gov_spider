    Washington, DC - Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Patty Murray (D-WA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement applauding news that the Food and Drug Administration's budget plan includes the original $4 million Congress allocated to the Office of Women's Health for FY2007. Last month, news reports revealed that the FDA intended to reallocate $1.2 million in funding from the FY 2007 budget of the Office of Women's Health (OWH) to other uses. The Senators immediately called on FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach to halt any efforts to sever funding for the Office of Women's Health and to ensure that the Office is fully funded.
"The FDA has done the right thing for women's health. By responding to our call and heeding Congress' clear intentions, the Office of Women's Health will have the funding needed to continue the leadership role it has served for sixteen years in improving the health and well-being of women across the United States. We look forward to working with Dr. von Eschenbach to further the accomplishments of the Office of Women's Health and meet our shared commitment to advancing and safeguarding women's health."
