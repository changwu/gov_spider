    Dear Mr. Attorney General:
On October 7, 2002, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (61 Stat. 155; 29 U.S.C. 176) (the "Act"), I issued Executive Order 13275. That Order created a Board of Inquiry to report on certain labor disputes affecting the maritime industry of the United States.
Today, I received the Board's written report in the matter. A copy of the report is attached. In my opinion, this unresolved labor dispute has resulted in a lock-out affecting a substantial part of the maritime industry of the United States, an industry that is engaged in trade, commerce, transportation (including the transportation of military supplies), transmission, and communication among the several States and with foreign nations. This lock-out, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national health and safety.
Therefore, in order to eliminate this peril and to secure the resumption of trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, and communication among the several States and with foreign nations, I direct you, pursuant to the provisions of section 208 of the Act, to petition in the name of the United States in any District Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties to enjoin the lock-out (or its continuance) and for such other relief as may in your judgment be appropriate.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
