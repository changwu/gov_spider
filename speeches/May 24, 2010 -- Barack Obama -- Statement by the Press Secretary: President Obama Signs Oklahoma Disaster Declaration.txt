    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Oklahoma and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds during the period of May 10-13, 2010.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in Carter, Cleveland, McIntosh, Okfuskee, Oklahoma, Pottawatomie, and Seminole Counties.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
