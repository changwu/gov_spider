    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 2/23/94)(Rules)(Kildee (D) MI and 38 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 6. The bill would: (1) reauthorize and restructure the elementary and secondary education programs of the Department of Education to make them better vehicles for helping all children achieve high standards; (2) direct greater Federal resources to the poorest schools and communities; (3) support education reforms underway in the States; (4) support sustained, intensive professional development in the core academic subjects for educators; (5) assist efforts to make our schools safe and drug-free; and (6) provide increased State and local administrative flexibility, in return for greater accountability for successful education results.
Although H.R. 6 contains individual provisions that the Administration does not support, the bill is consistent with Administration objectives and would be a major improvement over current law.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 6 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
