    Dear Mr. President:
I am deeply thankful that the siege at the Dominican Embassy has ended with the release of all the hostages. Your firm and patient leadership has achieved its goal: a dignified and peaceful solution. I am particularly grateful for your dedication to the hostages' safety and welfare during the long and delicate negotiations.
As you know, the United States unequivocally condemns all terrorists acts. I am pleased that our two governments have been able to work so closely together in this common struggle. A continued united effort by all governments is vital if terrorist violence around the world is to be curbed.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
