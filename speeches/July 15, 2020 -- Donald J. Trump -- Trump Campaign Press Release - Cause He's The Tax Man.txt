BIDEN IS PUSHING A $4 TRILLION TAX HIKE, MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT CLINTON PROPOSED
Multiple Analyses Show Biden Would Hike Taxes By $4 Trillion
According To The Tax Policy Center, Biden Would Hike Taxes By $4 Trillion Over The Next Decade. "Biden would increase income and payroll taxes on high-income individuals and increase income taxes on corporations. He would increase federal revenues by $4.0 trillion over the next decade. Under his plan, the highest-income households would see substantially larger tax increases than households in other income groups, both in dollar amounts and as share of their incomes." ("An Analysis of Former Vice President Biden's Tax Proposals," Tax Policy Center, 3/5/20)

$1.9 Trillion Would Come From Tax Hikes On Individual Americans. (Gordon B. Mermin, Surachai Khitatrakum, Chenxi Lu, Thornton Matheson and Jeffrey Rohaley, "An Analysis Of Former Vice President Biden's Tax Proposals," Tax Policy Center, 3/3/20)

According To The Tax Foundation, Biden Would Hike Taxes By $3.8 Trillion Over Ten Years. "Based on the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, we estimate that, on a conventional basis, Biden's plan would increase federal tax revenue by $3.8 trillion between 2021 and 2030 relative to current law." (Huaqun Li, Garrett Watson, and Taylor LaJoie, "Details And Analysis Of Former Vice President Biden's Tax Proposals," Tax Foundation, 4/29/20)
According To The Penn Wharton Budget Model, Biden Would Hike Taxes By $3.7 Trillion. "Relative to current law, PWBM projects that the updated Biden tax plan would raise between $3.1 trillion (including macroeconomic effects) and $3.7 trillion (not including macroeconomic effects) over fiscal years 2021-2030 while decreasing GDP by 0.6 percent in 2030 and 0.7 percent in 2050."

Biden's Tax Hike Is More Than Double What Hillary Clinton Proposed, The "Most Expensive" Seen From A Presidential Nominee In Modern Times
Biden's $4 Trillion Tax Hike Is More Than Double What Hillary Clinton Proposed In 2016. "Joe Biden's tax plan would raise taxes by $4 trillion over the coming decade, mostly paid by wealthier taxpayers, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated Thursday. The analysis shows that the former vice president's tax agenda is well to the left of past Democratic presidential campaigns. The same group, for instance, projected that Hillary Clinton's 2016 tax proposal would have increased taxes by $1.4 trillion over a decade." (Jay Heflin, "Biden Tax Plan Would Raise $4 Trillion, More Than Twice The Hike Proposed By Clinton In 2016," Washington Examiner, 3/5/20)
CNBC Business Reporter Robert Frank Described Biden's Tax Plan As "The Most Expensive Democratic Plan We Have Seen From Any Democratic Candidate In Recent History." ROBERT FRANK: "Well, the truth is that, Joe Biden, even though he is portrayed as a moderate is offering the most expensive Democratic plan that we have seen from any Democratic candidate in recent history. Hillary Clinton's plan was 1.5 trillion. Biden's plan is $4 trillion." (CNBC's "Closing Bell," 5/22/20)

Biden's Tax Plan Would Shrink The Economy By 1.5 Percent And Kill 585,000 Jobs According To The Tax Foundation. "According to the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, Biden's tax plan would reduce the economy's size by 1.51 percent in the long run. The plan would shrink the capital stock by 3.23 percent and reduce the overall wage rate by 0.98 percent, leading to 585,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs."

The Fact Is Biden Would Raise Taxes On 80 Percent Of Americans, With Tax Hikes Falling On Americans At Every Income Level
A Penn Wharton Budget Model Analysis Found 82.6 Percent Of Americans Would See A Tax Hike Under Biden's Plan. ("The Updated Biden Tax Plan: Budgetary, Distributional, And Economic Effects," Penn Wharton, 3/10/20)

The Penn Wharton Budget Model Says Biden's Plan Would Hike Taxes On Americans At Every Income Level. ("The Updated Biden Tax Plan: Budgetary, Distributional, And Economic Effects," University Of Pennsylvania Wharton, 3/10/20)

The Tax Foundation Found That Biden's Tax Plan Would Lead To Americans "Across All Income Groups" Seeing Lower After Tax Incomes. "In 2021, on a conventional basis, taxpayers in the top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes reduced by around 13.0 percent due to higher taxes on income above $400,000. However, taxpayers in other income quintiles would also see a reduction in their after-tax income. On a dynamic basis, the Tax Foundation's General Equilibrium Model estimates that the plan would reduce after-tax incomes by around 2.6 percent across all income groups over the long run."

Obamacare Imposed A Tax On Individuals Who Did Not Comply With Obamacare's Minimum Essential Coverage. "As you probably know by now, Obamacare imposes a penalty on individuals who fail to have a certain level of health insurance coverage for any month of the year. This requirement is commonly called the individual mandate, and the penalty is the cost of noncompliance." (Bill Bischoff, "Beware of the 2016 Obamacare individual mandate penalty," MarketWatch, 10/27/15)

In 2016 The Individual Mandate Was The Higher Of $695 Per Adult And $347.50 Per Child Or 2.5 Percent Of Income. "The penalty you pay for not having health coverage is either a dollar amount or a percentage of family income, whichever is greater. … For 2016 and beyond, the law set the penalty at $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a maximum of $2,085 for a family—or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is greater. Penalties are to rise with inflation." ("What Is the Individual Mandate for Health Care Reform?" Turbotax, Accessed 3/12/20)

In 2016, Nearly 5 Million Americans Were Forced To Pay The Individual Mandate Penalty, Costing Them $3.6 Billion. ("Obamacare's Poverty Tax: Americans Paying individual Mandate Tax Penalty," Senator Steve Daines, 2016)

Biden Would Hike Business Taxes By A Staggering $2.1 Trillion. (Gordon B. Mermin, Surachai Khitatrakum, Chenxi Lu, Thornton Matheson and Jeffrey Rohaley, "An Analysis Of Former Vice President Biden's Tax Proposals," Tax Policy Center, 3/3/20)
Biden Has Promised To Raise The Business Tax Rate To 28 Percent. JOE BIDEN: "I would raise the -- and raise billions of dollars, raise the corporate tax rate from 20 to 28 percent -- it was 36 -- to 28 percent. I'd raise billions of dollars." (Joe Biden, The Lead With Jake Tapper, CNN, 7/5/19)

Biden's Proposed 28 Percent Business Tax Rate Would Give The U.S. A Higher Rate Than China, And Would Put The U.S. About The Average For Industrialized Nations. "The Biden 28 percent rate would give the U.S. a higher rate than the United Kingdom (19 percent), China (25 percent), Canada (26.8 percent), and Ireland (12.5 percent). It would impose a tax rate higher than the current combined corporate rate across the 36 member Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD), which is currently 23.7 percent." (Adam Sabes, "Biden: I Will Raise Corporate Tax Rate To 28%," Americans For Tax Reform, 7/9/19)

The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board:Raising Taxes On Businesses Would Make American Companies Less Competitive Globally. "Raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. This would make American companies less competitive globally. Add in state corporate taxes—up to 8.84% in California, 11.5% in New Jersey, 9.5% in Illinois—and many businesses would face a top tax rate in the high 30s. In the European Union, the average top statutory rate is 21.8%, according to a Tax Foundation report last week. The Biden increase would vault the U.S. corporate rate back to near the top in the developed world." (The Editorial Board, "Joe Biden's 'Modest' Tax Proposal," The Wall Street Journal, 12/18/19)

BIDEN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING HIGHER TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS
Obamacare Contained Multiple Taxes That Hit The Middle Class
Obamacare Imposed A Tax On Individuals Who Did Not Buy Health Insurance. "As you probably know by now, Obamacare imposes a penalty on individuals who fail to have a certain level of health insurance coverage for any month of the year. This requirement is commonly called the individual mandate, and the penalty is the cost of noncompliance." (Bill Bischoff, "Beware of the 2016 Obamacare individual mandate penalty," MarketWatch, 10/27/15)

In 2016 The Individual Mandate Was The Higher Of $695 Per Adult And $347.50 Per Child Or 2.5 Percent Of Income. "For 2016 and beyond, the law set the penalty at $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a maximum of $2,085 for a family—or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is greater. Penalties are to rise with inflation." ("What Is the Individual Mandate for Health Care Reform?" Turbotax, Accessed 3/12/20)
According To The IRS, 58 Percent Of People Who Paid The Individual Mandate Tax Made Under $50,000. (Andrew Minicozzi, "Modeling The Effects Of The Individual Mandate On Health Insurance Coverage," Congressional Budget Office, 11/14/17)

Obamacare Imposed A 40 Percent "Cadillac Tax" On Certain Health Care Plans. "The politics of health care are changing. And one of the most controversial parts of the Affordable Care Act — the so-called 'Cadillac tax' — may be about to change with it. The Cadillac tax is a 40% tax on the most generous employer-provided health insurance plans — those that cost more than $11,200 per year for an individual policy or $30,150 for family coverage. It was a tax on employers and was supposed to take effect in 2018, but Congress has delayed implementation twice." (Julie Rovner, "'Cadillac Tax' On Generous Health Plans May Be Headed For Repeal," National Public Radio, 8/14/19)

The Cadillac Tax Was Criticized For Disproportionately Hurting Employees' Fringe Benefits. "The tax has also been criticized because it would hit some health insurance plans harder than others, such as more expensive plans provided by labor unions that tend to compensate employees heavily with fringe benefits." (Scott Eastman, "The 'Cadillac' Tax and the Income Tax Exclusion for Employer-Sponsored Insurance," Tax Foundation, 6/19/19)
Employers, Insurance Companies, And Labor Unions Were Critical Of The Cadillac Tax Arguing That Ordinary Workers Would Be Hit Hardest By The Levy. "Critics of the tax, including some employers, insurance companies, and labor unions (they've had more success recently bargaining for generous benefits than higher wages) argue that ordinary workers would be hit hardest by the levy." ("TaxVox: Federal Budget And Economy," Tax Policy Center, Accessed 3/12/20)

Obamacare Imposed A Spending Limit Of $2,500 On Flexible Spending Accounts Which Previously Were Not Capped. "The 30 - 35 million Americans who use a pre-tax Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at work to pay for their family's basic medical needs face an Obamacare-imposed cap of $2,500. This tax will hit Americans $32 billion over the next ten years. Before Obamacare, the accounts were unlimited under federal law, though employers were allowed to set a cap." (John Kartch, "List of Obamacare," Americans For Tax Reform, 2/23/17)

Middle Class Parents Can Find Themselves "Quickly Hitting This New Cap, Meaning They Have To Pony Up Some Or All Of The Cost With After-Tax Dollars." "Now, parents looking to sock away extra money to pay for braces find themselves quickly hitting this new cap, meaning they have to pony up some or all of the cost with after-tax dollars. Needless to say, this tax especially impacts middle class families." (John Kartch, "List of Obamacare," Americans For Tax Reform, 2/23/17)

The Budget Resolution That Raised Income Taxes For Individuals In The 25 Percent Tax Bracket, Who At The Time Featured Individuals With A Taxable Income Of $41,500 And A Married Couple Making $83,000. "What Obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire. In particular, the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre-2001 level of 28 percent... So to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket, an individual would need to earn at least $41,500 in total income, while a married couple would need a combined income of at least $83,000."
