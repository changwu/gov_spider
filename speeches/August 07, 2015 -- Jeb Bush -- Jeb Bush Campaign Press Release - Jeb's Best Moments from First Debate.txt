2. Jeb to Hillary on Keystone: "Give me a break"

3. "As Governor of the state of Florida, I defunded Planned Parenthood. I created a culture of life in our state."

4. Jeb on Education: "I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly"

5. "They called me 'Veto Corleone'"
