    CabaÃ±as calls Hillary candidate with most conviction and character
Puerto Rico Democratic Committee Vice Chair and Superdelegate Luisette CabaÃ±as announced her support for Hillary Clinton today at an event with Chelsea Clinton in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
"Today I endorse Hillary Clinton for President because of her strong win in Pennsylvania," said CabaÃ±as. "She has shown a firm conviction and the character needed to lead the nation. Her proposals for Puerto Rico, particularly those related to healthcare, are the best by far of any candidate in history."
CabaÃ±as is a successful real estate businesswoman and has been Vice Chair of the Democratic Committee in Puerto Rico since 2003.
"I am honored to have the support of Ms. CabaÃ±as," said Hillary Clinton. "I look forward to working with Luisette and the many friends that we have in Puerto Rico on issues important to the island like health care and economic development."
