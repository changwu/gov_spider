    HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today extends his strong, national organization to the Great Lakes State, announcing the first round of his Michigan Grassroots Leadership Team comprised of conservative leaders from all over the state. The announcement comes the same day that the Cruz campaign announced county chairs in every one of the 171 counties that comprise the first four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.
"I am excited to have the support of such an accomplished group of conservatives in Michigan," said Sen. Cruz. "Their experience and depth of political knowledge in the state is a tremendous resource for our campaign. Our growing team of grassroots activists and political leaders across the country is helping to spread our message, build our organization and raise the resources we'll need to be competitive for the long run."
"I am honored to support a man who has kept his promise to tell the truth and do what he said he would do, all while in the crucible of public service. Ted Cruz will make an exceptional President of the United States," said Michigan Campaign Chairman State Senator Patrick Colbeck.
