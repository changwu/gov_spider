...The problem is no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough. Just watch they will Harass & Complain & Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO we've got a Country to run!Retweets: 29744Favorites: 126060

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So they were either duped or corrupt? In any event their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!Retweets: 35782Favorites: 148994

It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws. In less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved. But the Dems don't care about the crime they don't want any victory for Trump and the Republicans even if good for USA!Retweets: 38782Favorites: 160905

Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!Retweets: 32334Favorites: 139280

'The Trump Administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to Iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the U.S. or our allies. That's the definition of a foreign-policy achievement.' Bret Stephens @nytimes We are getting stronger all over the world watch!Retweets: 26911Favorites: 115709
