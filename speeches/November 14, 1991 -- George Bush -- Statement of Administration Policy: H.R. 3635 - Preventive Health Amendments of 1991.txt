    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/15/91)(House)(Waxman (D) CA)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3635. The Administration, however, will seek an amendment in the Senate to delete title II of the bill which would establish a National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control.
As drafted, implementation of the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control would cause serious conflict of interest, concerns. In addition, the "foundation" concept is new within the Department of Health and Human Services. More time is needed to develop safeguards to assure that such a private foundation would operate in a manner consistent with the missions of the Centers for Disease Control.
