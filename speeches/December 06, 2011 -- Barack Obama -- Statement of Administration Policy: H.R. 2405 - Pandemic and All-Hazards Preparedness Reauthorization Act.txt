(House)
(Rep. Rogers, Râ€“MI, and 4 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2405, which would reauthorize several key programs led by the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare the Nation for bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. In addition to continuing existing activities, including the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures, H.R. 2405 would expand the Food and Drug Administration's role in strengthening the Nation's preparedness. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to improve and strengthen the bill, for example by authorizing a Strategic Investor for medical countermeasures, as its consideration shifts to the Senate.
