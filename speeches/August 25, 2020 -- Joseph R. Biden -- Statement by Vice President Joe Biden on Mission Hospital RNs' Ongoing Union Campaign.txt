    Congratulations to the registered nurses at HCA's Mission Hospital on their ongoing campaign to form a union and join National Nurses United. I've said it before, and I mean it: if there are angels in heaven, they're nurses. We owe an immense debt of gratitude to these heroes, who get up and fight on the front lines of this pandemic each and every day with humility and compassion. They put their lives on the line when they clock in, and that's enough to bear without the threat of unsafe conditions — exacerbated by the Trump Administration's failure to take steps needed to keep workers safe. I'm proud to stand by the Mission RNs in their collective bid for a better, safer, and more equitable workplace — an impressive show of solidarity not just for themselves, but for the health of their entire community.
