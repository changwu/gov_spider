    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(McCollum (R) FL)
The Administration would support passage of H.R. 668 if it were amended to address the problems described below. The provisions that would streamline procedures for deportation of criminal aliens are largely consistent with related deportation proposals announced by the President on February 7th.
The Administration supports reimbursement to the States (and political subdivisions, thereof) for the costs incurred to incarcerate criminal illegal aliens and supported the related provisions of the 1994 Crime Act. In the FY 1995 Budget, the Administration proposed a funding level of $350 million for reimbursement to the States and is spending $130 million in the current year—the maximum authorized in the i994 Act. The President's Budget for FY 1996 proposes $300 million in appropriations for this purpose. However, H.R. 668 in its current form is inconsistent with the President's Budget proposal and does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending; therefore, it could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.
The Administration supports other provisions of H.R. 668 with technical changes, including changes to ensure that current authority to conduct deportation hearings electronically is not disrupted and to ensure consistency with our treaty obligations.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 668 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates.
