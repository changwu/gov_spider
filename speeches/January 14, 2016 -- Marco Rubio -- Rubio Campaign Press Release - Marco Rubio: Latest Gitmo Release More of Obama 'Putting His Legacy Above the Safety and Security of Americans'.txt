Marco opposes the President's dangerous plan to close Gitmo, and here's what he had to say today:
President Obama is continuing with his reckless plan to empty Guantanamo despite the risks to our national security.
In an increasingly unstable world with radical Islam on the march, the last thing we should be doing is giving more terrorists a chance to rejoin the fight. Numerous detainees released from Guantanamo haveÂ returned to targeting America, some even going to lead groups dedicated to killing Americans.
The stakes are so high that our military has been increasingly concerned about President Obama's obsession with closing Guantanamo Bay and has attempted to put the brakes on many transfers. The President needs to stop putting his legacy above the safety and security of Americans.
