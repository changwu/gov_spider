    McLean, VA - Here's an exchange from last night's debate that may have slipped your notice...
The Los Angeles Times reports: "Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee set the tone by saying rival Rudolph W. Giuliani believes in federal funding for abortion and 'sanctuary cities' for illegal immigrants."
...
"As for sanctuary cities, Giuliani defended his policy, saying it enabled 'illegal immigrants to report crime and to put their children in school.'"
Conservative Republicans who opposed the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform bill earlier this year would be shocked to learn that Rudy Giuliani not only supported sanctuary cities and ignored the problem of illegal immigration while he was Mayor of New York City but he actively advocated for more rights on behalf of illegal immigrants.
