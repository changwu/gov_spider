    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sawyer (D) OH)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4982 for the following major reasons:

—  The excessive authorizations for the Department of Education's Eisenhower elementary and secondary mathematics and science education program.
—  The reduced discretion for local educational agencies, in using Federal program funds, to choose between training elementary and secondary school teachers, regardless of true local needs.
—  The duplication of existing activities by the proposed regional consortia, which would disseminate math and science teaching materials, methods; and assessment tools.
