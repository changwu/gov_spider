    "For the last year, and four debates, three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate, the President's been looking for a plan. He's been looking for some way to help the gentleman I spoke about, some way to help the 23 million people that are out of work. He hasn't been able to find a plan. He hasn't been able to define what he's going to do to make America strong going forward. I have." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Now, for those of you in your 40s and 50s, who have always anticipated that these would be the high earning years, the most productive years, the years that you'd be able to put a little away for retirement or perhaps help your kids with college, and yet you're finding that's harder and harder to do because incomes have been going down at the same time prices have been going up for things like gasoline and health care and food. I was speaking with a gentleman just the other day, and he said that he used to have a job at $25 an hour plus benefits, and now he's only able to get a job at $9 an hour, and he wonders what's going to become of him, what's going to happen to his future. The President's campaign slogan is 'Forward.' To this gentleman, things don't feel like they're going forward; it feels more like backward. To 23 million Americans, it feels like backward, those that can't find good work. And so for the last -- for the last year, and four debates, three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate, the President's been looking for a plan. He's been looking for some way to help the gentleman I spoke about, some way to help the 23 million people that are out of work. He hasn't been able to find a plan. He hasn't been able to define what he's going to do to make America strong going forward. I have. I have a plan that will create 12 million jobs and rising take-home pay, and I'm going to help that man who needs that good job."
