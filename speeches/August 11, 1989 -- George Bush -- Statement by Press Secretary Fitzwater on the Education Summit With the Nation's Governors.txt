    The education summit with the Nation's Governors will be held in Charlottesville, VA, on September 27 and 28.
In his speech to the National Governors' Association in Chicago on July 31, President Bush invited the Governors to work with him at a Governors summit on education to share ideas and to explore options for educational progress in order to find ways to strengthen our schools, to enlarge opportunities, and to improve our nation's educational performance.
This will be the third time in history that a President has called the Nation's Governors together to address a single problem facing our country. In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt called the Governors together to address problems of conservation. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt called for the Nation's Governors to assemble to consider solutions to the Great Depression. President Bush calls the Governors together because he believes raising the level of learning in the classrooms of America is crucial to our nation's future.
