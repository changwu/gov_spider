    Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm very, very honored to be here tonight, and I listened to Pat Robertson and he gave us good advice. I'm honored to be up with real heroes like Jim Stockdale. I remember . . . Is Cybill here? Hey, Cybill come on up here. I want you up here, yeah.
[applause]
[laughter]
Hey, you stay up here.
A long time ago when we were engaged in a conflict with Viet Nam, many of our soldiers were either prisoners of war or missing in action. And there was a lot of concern about whether or not the Congress, or the government, or even the American people, cared or knew about it.
But, there was one person who I think really initiated the whole thing. That was Jim Stockdale's wife, Cybill . And, she came to Washington. I remember going to a meeting. I think it was on a Saturday afternoon. I think every member of Congress was invited and I think four or five of us showed up. It was disappointing to the mothers and to the wives and to the children of those who were being held a prisoner of war and to those who were missing in action.
And, I guess like you do in politics sometimes, I made a rash promise. I said, in 90 days, we will fill up Constitution Hall which seats 12,000 people. And in 90 days because of the efforts of Cybill Stockdale and many, many others, we did fill up Constitution Hall.
DOLE: We had 12,000 people there and it began.
[applause]
STOCKDALE: It was because of you that we filled it up. That's why.
[applause]
DOLE: And I think we were able to start the League of Families. American people began to recognize the difference between someone who is a MIA or a POW. Not many people knew the difference. And so, I'm honored to be on the same stage with Cybill . She later came to Kansas to campaign for me, and I appreciate that very much. Probably saved my bacon. Saved my seat, too. And, I'm very proud that this time around Jim Stockdale is a Bob Dole delegate from California.
[applause]
Let me just say another word or two because I know you've all had long days. I'm very proud of America as everyone in this room is. We all love America. Some of us have been priviledged to serve in some branch of the armed services for America. We learned a lot about our fellow man in the service. I remember going to Russell, Kansas to Brooklyn College. That was a big, that's a stretch. Quite an experience. And then I remember Louisiana and then I remember several other places in Texas and other places.
But I remember most of all, a group that I joined in Italy and they get in the Tenth mountain division, not when I joined the tenth, but initially to get into the Tenth mountain division, you had to have letters of recommendation — believe it or not, two. That right Deb ? Oh, excuse me, three.
[laughter]
When I went in, you just had to be warm.
[laughter]
And, I never fully understood why someone from the plains and the flatlands of Kansas would wind up in ski troops. And then these young men who were in the Tenth Division, when the war was over, came back and started the ski industry all across America, and make a big, big difference for a lot of people — recreation. Some even made money which is legal in America.
It was better before Clinton. You didn't pay as much in taxes but we're going to change all that. And one of those great skiers is Deb Jennings who's up here with me tonight who's going to get up at 4:30 in the morning to be on a talk show.
DOLE: I told him not to call; I'll call him later.
[laughter]
So, I wanted to say to all the veterans and all their families, you know, we are sort of a fraternity. There is sort of a camaraderie. There is a bond. There's something about serving your country. And not everybody can, don't misunderstand me.
But there's something about serving your country that sort of brings us together. We can be from Brooklyn and Russell, Kansas; or we can be from Mississippi and Seattle, and we can appreciate each other. Different backgrounds, different economic backgrounds, different ethnic backgrounds, different racial backgrounds.
And one thing we learned very quickly in the service is that we're there for one purpose. And that's to serve America. And, as I'll say Thursday night, when something happened and somebody lost their life or somebody was seriously wounded, it was American blood that was shed, American blood that we shed.
We didn't look at their race; we didn't look at their background. They were Americans. And they shed their blood and gave their lives and lost their...
[applause]
They're Americans.
[applause]
And that's really the strength of this country. We have our differences. We come from different places. We do different things. Have different incomes and all the other things that go with it.
But the bottom line is, when America provides the leadership and when the call to service is issued, we show up. You show up. Your families show up. Your children show up. To support the greatest nation on the face of the Earth, the United States of America.
[applause]
So, it's a great honor for me to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Who would believe that — what can happen in America, that somebody from Russell, Kansas would end up in San Diego accepting a major party's nomination for the highest office in the land and the most important office in the world.
And I feel good about it. We are going to win this election on November 5, 1996.
[applause]
ALL: (Dole, Dole.)
DOLE: Thank you. Thank you.
And I want to thank Tom Birch and all the others who've been working on my behalf for well over a year now.
I'm not certain there's any such thing as a veteran's vote.
ALL: (Yes, there is.)
DOLE: But I'm willing to find out.
[laughter]
[applause]
And if I am the commander — if I am the president of the United States, you'll know who your commander-in-chief is. Decisions are made to send young men or young women half way around the world to protect our interests, I will make that decision and not Boutros Boutros Ghali at the United Nations.
[applause]
ALL: (Dole, Dole)
DOLE: Well, thank you very much. God bless America. Our best days are yet ahead. And never forget, we are the greatest country on the face of the earth.
Thank you.
[applause]
(UNKNOWN): Senator Dole, on behalf of our country's veterans, we salute you for your service and sacrifice.
[applause]
