    Washington, DC â€“ The Office of the Vice President announced today that Melanie Kaye, Director of Communications to Dr. Jill Biden departed the White House. Kaye is succeeded by James M. Gleeson, who most recently worked in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"It has been a pleasure to have Melanie serve as my Director of Communications," said Dr. Jill Biden. "Her incredible dedication and remarkable skills have helped us bolster our Joining Forces initiative for our country's military families, honor teachers and bring attention to the importance of education for our children and country's future, improve access to quality health care, and promote the empowerment of women and girls. I am so grateful for Melanie's invaluable advice over the past three years as well as her kindness and integrity. Joe and I wish her all the best."
James Gleeson comes to the White House from the U.S. House of Representatives where he served as Communications Director to Congressman Xavier Becerra (CA-34), Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. From passage of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to find budget solutions during the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Super Committee, to the pursuit of commonsense immigration reform and economic policies to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class, James helped coordinate House Democrats' communications strategy and messaging efforts since 2009.
Before moving to D.C., James was an Account Manager for a political consulting firm in Denver, Colorado. Prior to that, he served in the Colorado State House as a Legislative Aide to then-Majority Caucus Leader Michael Cerbo, and as a Policy Strategist for the Autism Society of Colorado.
James attended Arapahoe Community College in Littleton, Colorado and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland with his wife Kelly Berens Gleeson.
