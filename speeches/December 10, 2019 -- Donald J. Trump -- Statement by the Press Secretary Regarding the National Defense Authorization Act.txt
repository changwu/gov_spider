    The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) advances many of President Donald J. Trump's priorities, including a 3.1-percent pay raise for our troops, providing up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave for Federal employees, ensuring survivors of deceased service members receive the benefits they deserve, and establishing the United States Space Force, fulfilling the President's promise to maintain America's leadership in space. Additionally, the NDAA supports President Trump's historic rebuilding of the military while preserving essential statutory tools to secure our border and rejecting progressive attempts to limit the President's authorities as Commander in Chief.
