    To the Congress of the United States:
It is my sad duty to inform you officially of the death of Dwight David Eisenhower, the thirty-fourth President of the United States.
We have lost a great leader, a great friend and a great man. I know there are many members of the Congress who had the privilege of serving under his military., leadership, and who later, during his eight years as President, shared with him in the building of a better America. He had a profound respect for the traditions, the institutions and the instruments of our nation. He leaves to the Congress and to all Americans the spirit of patriotism and statesmanship beyond party which marked his entire career. As we grieve at his death, we all will recall that spirit, which can guide and sustain us in our tasks ahead. He has been an inspiration to us all, and ours is a better government because he walked among us.
