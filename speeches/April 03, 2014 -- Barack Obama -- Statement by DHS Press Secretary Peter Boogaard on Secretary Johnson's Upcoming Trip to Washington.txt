    "On Sunday, April 6, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate will travel to Washington to survey the damage and meet with individuals impacted by the recent mudslide. Secretary Johnson and Administrator Fugate will also meet with federal, state and local officials and first responders involved in the ongoing response and recovery efforts. Additional details will be announced once they are finalized.
On Wednesday, April 2, President Obama approved a major disaster declaration for the State of Washington to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the area affected by flooding and mudslidesâ€”providing federal funding to affected individuals in Snohomish County, including the Sauk-Suiattle, Stillaguamish, and Tulalip Tribes. This assistance is in addition to the support provided under the Presidential Emergency Declaration granted on March 24, 2014."
