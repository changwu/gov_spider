    President Bush met in the Oval Office today with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin. This was the first meeting between the two leaders. President Bush told President Aylwin that he is looking forward to his visit to Chile during his South America trip later this fall. He expressed the United States strong support for Chile's return to democracy and our commitment to close and cooperative relations with Chile.
The President informed President Aylwin that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) can now resume its investment guarantee programs in Chile. This OPIC activity had been revoked under the previous government because of concerns over worker rights. Following a review process, it has been determined that these abuses have been eliminated.
President Bush also congratulated President Aylwin on the completion of a bilateral framework agreement on trade and investment between our two countries. This is the third such agreement since the Enterprise for the Americas initiative was announced on June 27. Other agreements have been signed with Colombia and Ecuador. We welcome the opportunity to strengthen this aspect of our economic cooperation with Chile.
The two Presidents reviewed other economic issues in the relationship, such as GSP, and the Letelier case. President Bush told President Aylwin that we look forward to the completion of Chilean legislative action which will insure that justice is done.
