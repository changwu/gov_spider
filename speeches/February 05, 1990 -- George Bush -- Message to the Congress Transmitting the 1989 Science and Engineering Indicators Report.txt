    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the Congress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science & Engineering Indicators -- 1989. This report is the ninth in a continuing series examining key aspects of the status of American science and engineering.
The importance of scientific and engineering research to the well-being of our Nation is widely recognized. Science and engineering play a vital role in maintaining our Nation's defense, improving its health, and increasing its economic productivity.
I commend Science & Engineering Indicators -- 1989 to the attention of the Congress and those in the scientific endeavor.
