    We reiterate the unequivocal support of the U.S. Government for Philippine democracy and the government of President Corazon Aquino. We strongly condemn the effort to destabilize the elected Philippine Government. According to U.S. law, all U.S. foreign assistance to the Philippines would be suspended if the elected government of the Philippines were removed by a military coup.
