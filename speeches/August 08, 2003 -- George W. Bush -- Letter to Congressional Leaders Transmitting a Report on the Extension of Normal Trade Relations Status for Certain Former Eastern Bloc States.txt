    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby submit an updated report to the Congress, prepared by my Administration, consistent with sections 402(b) and 409(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2432(b) and 2439(b)), concerning the emigration laws and policies of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The report indicates continued compliance of these countries with international standards concerning freedom of emigration, with the exception of Turkmenistan. In light of new developments, I am submitting a waiver for Turkmenistan.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
