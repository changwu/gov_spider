    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report a proposal to rescind $12.4 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting six revisions to previously transmitted deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $130.6 million.
The rescission proposal involves law enforcement assistance in the Department of Justice. The revisions to existing deferrals involve programs in the Departments of Defense, Energy and Justice, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
The details of the rescission proposal and each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
