    "Let's work together to get the American people working..." â€” Mitt Romney
Remarks
Golden, CO
August 2, 2012


MITT ROMNEY: "I spent my life in the private sector. I know how jobs come and go. I worked in a state. I found a way to work across the aisle, by the way. We've got to have someone that goes to Washington that buries the hatchet and says you know what: there are good Democrats, there are good Republicans that care about America. Let's work together to get the American people working, get some growth again."
