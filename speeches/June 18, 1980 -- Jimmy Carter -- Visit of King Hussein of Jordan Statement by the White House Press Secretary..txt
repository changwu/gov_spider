    The President and His Majesty met with their advisers this morning in the Cabinet Room for about 1 hour and 45 minutes to continue the discussions which they began yesterday. The participants in the second meeting were the same as we posted for the first meeting.
They had a useful and constructive exchange which showed similar perspectives on overall regional security questions.
On the Middle East peace process, they made progress in understanding each other's approaches to the problems of the region. The talks provided a good basis for working together in the future toward their common goal of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
