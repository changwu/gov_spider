    The President has waived for Romania the emigration provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, reflecting the wide freedom of emigration which the citizens of Romania now enjoy. The President's decision responds to requests from leaders of Romania's democratic opposition, as well as from the Romanian Government, and will directly benefit the people of Romania as they face continuing economic hardship.
The Jackson-Vanik waiver will make Romania eligible to apply for credit guarantees for commercial imports of U.S. agricultural products. These would provide needed agricultural commodities, beyond the more than $120 million in U.S. food and other humanitarian assistance supplied in fiscal years 1990 and 1991.
The waiver does not constitute restoration of most favored nation (MFN) tariff status, which Romania renounced in 1988. MFN status is a separate issue, which will be decided on the basis of further substantial progress toward a market economy and democratic pluralism, including the holding of free and fair local and parliamentary elections in the near future.
The President's decision also underscores the great importance the United States attaches to continued movement toward free markets and democracy throughout Central and Eastern Europe.
