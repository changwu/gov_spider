    U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today issued the following statement in response to the filing of more than a dozen amicus curiae briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the Biden Administration's student debt relief plan:
"The broad array of organizations and experts – representing diverse communities and different perspectives – supporting our case before the Supreme Court today reflects the strength of our legal positions versus the fundamentally flawed lawsuits aimed at denying millions of working and middle-class borrowers debt relief. As these diverse groups made clear today, student loan borrowers from all walks of life suffered profound financial harms during the pandemic and their continued recovery and successful repayment hinges on the Biden Administration's student debt relief plan. We will continue to defend our legal authority to provide the debt relief working and middle-class families clearly need and deserve."
