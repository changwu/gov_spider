Mitt Romney today announced the support of Connecticut elected officials and leaders. Romney also announced that House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, Senate Minority Leader John McKinney and former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley will chair his Steering Committee in the state.
"I am proud to announce my supporters in Connecticut," said Mitt Romney. "Connecticut voters want a president with a record of job creation, cutting spending, and keeping taxes low. That is why I am running for President. These leaders will help me as I reach out to voters in Connecticut spreading this pro-growth message and working to bring jobs back to the state and the country."
Announcing his support, House Minority Leader Larry Cafero said, "Connecticut voters are looking for someone who has experience working in the real economy. After three years of failed policies, it is clear that we need a candidate who will defeat President Obama and get America's fiscal house in order."
Senate Minority Leader John McKinney said, "With millions of Americans unemployed, is time for a president who will get people back to work. From his experience in the private sector, Mitt Romney understands what is required to create jobs. As Governor of Massachusetts, he balanced the budget without raising taxes. Washington needs this kind of leadership more than ever."
