    To Judge John Sirica
On behalf of the American people, I congratulate you for your distinguished career in the Federal judiciary since 1957.
You have been given an opportunity afforded to few of us who enter upon public service: to exhibit, at a time of the greatest challenge to our system of government, the personal courage and wisdom needed to sustain it, and by these actions to become a lasting symbol of unflinching devotion to duty.
As you retire now from regular active service, you have my warmest wishes for good health, happiness, and more years of fruitful contributions as a Senior Judge.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable John J. Sirica, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.]
October 4, 1977
My dear Mr. President:
This is to formally advise you that I have decided under the provisions of Section 371(b) of Title 28, United States Code to retire from regular active service as a Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and to assume the role and status of a Senior Judge of that Court effective at the close of business Monday, October 31, 1977.
For over twenty years now I have been privileged to serve as a Judge of this great tribunal, and can only hope I have contributed to and measured up in some slight degree to the high responsibilities thus imposed.
With every good wish for your health and happiness, I am
Respectfully yours,
JOHN J. SIRICA
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
