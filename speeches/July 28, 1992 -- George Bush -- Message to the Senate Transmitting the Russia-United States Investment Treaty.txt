    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, with Protocol and related exchanges of letters, signed at Washington on June 17, 1992. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to this treaty.
This treaty creates a favorable legal framework for U.S. investment in Russia. By adopting the treaty's high standards for protection of U.S. investment, Russia seeks to encourage the U.S. private sector to invest in Russia. For the United States Government, the treaty serves the goals of aiding Russia's transition to a market economy and of strengthening our bilateral economic ties.
In addition, the treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international investment. A specific tenet, reflected in this treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment. Under this treaty, the Parties also agree to international law standards for expropriation and expropriation compensation; free transfers of funds associated with investments; and the option of the investor to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration.
I recommend that the Senate consider this treaty as soon as possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the treaty, with protocol and related exchanges of letters, at an early date.
