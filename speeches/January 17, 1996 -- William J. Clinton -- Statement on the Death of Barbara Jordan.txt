    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of our good friend Barbara Jordan. Her eloquent voice, which articulated the views and concerns of millions of Americans, was always a source of inspiration to us. Barbara's words flowed with heartfelt conviction and her actions rang of indefatigable determination as she challenged us as a nation to confront our weaknesses and live peacefully together as equals.
I am personally appreciative of her efforts to address the difficult problem of illegal immigration as Chair of the Commission on Immigration Reform. Hillary and I join the University of Texas, the Nation, and all those who fight for equal rights and justice in mourning the death of a great woman and a gifted public servant. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family.
