    Memorandum for Federal Employees and Military Personnel
Federal government employees traditionally have responded generously in aiding those less fortunate than ourselves. Particularly noteworthy have been the tremendous compassion and support we have demonstrated through our contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign.
Once again, this yearly opportunity to support the services of voluntary health and welfare agencies, including the United Way, The American Red Cross, National Health Agencies and International Service Agencies, by participating in the Combined Federal Campaign is upon us. These agencies help make our community a better place in which to live; they alleviate pain and suffering, and seek cures from dreaded diseases; they bring hope to those in overseas lands, and reinforce a sense of security in the aged, infirm, and handicapped.
In the spirit of neighborliness, we will continue our tradition of generosity and concern for others through contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign. I am confident of your support.
