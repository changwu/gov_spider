    In a new poll released by Politico and Morning Consult today, Americans overwhelmingly support each of the proposals in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The poll found:

80% of voters, including 79% of Republicans, support updating roads and bridges
75% of voters, including 69% of Republicans, support water, sewage, power projects
71% of voters, including 61% of Republicans, support improvements to public transit
66% of voters, including 56% of Republicans, support the expansion of high-speed Internet
64% of voters, including 53% of Republicans, support coastal resilience measures
61% of voters, including 52% of Republicans, support new passenger and freight rail projects

In short, majorities of voters from all parties support all six provisions included in the infrastructure bill.
President Biden's plan will make historical investments in our infrastructure and economic growth. In the process, it will enhance our competitiveness and create millions of good-paying jobs.
As the infrastructure bill moves through Congress this week, poll after poll demonstrate sustained and broad support. New polls from Monmouth and Harvard CAPS-Harris show 70% and 72% of respondents are in favor of the bipartisan infrastructure plan, respectively.
Americans from all parties are making it clear that funding for roads and bridges, clean water, public transit, high-speed Internet access, and other provisions are good ideas that will benefit their communities. President Biden's infrastructure proposal will deliver on these investments and provide real results for Americans across the country.
