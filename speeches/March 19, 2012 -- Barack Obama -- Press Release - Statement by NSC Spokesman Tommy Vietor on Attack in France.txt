    We were deeply saddened to learn of the horrific attack this morning against the teachers and students of a Jewish school in the French city of Toulouse. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of the victims, and we stand with a community in grief. We join the Government of France in condemning this unprovoked and outrageous act of violence in the strongest possible terms.
