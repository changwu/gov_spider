HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Dick and Richard (Rich) Bott. Dick Bott is the chairman and founder of Bott Radio Network, one of the nation's largest Christian talk networks. Rich Bott serves as CEO and President. Bott Radio Network has more than 100 broadcast stations in 15 states, with a combined coverage of 51 million Americans.
"Not since Ronald Reagan has this country seen someone with the ability and the wisdom that Ted Cruz has," Dick Bott said. "Our listeners are eager to select the next President of the United States – a man of principle, of Christian character, and a proven leader with a record of conservative accomplishment."
"Ted Cruz is unwavering in his principles, bold to stand up for what's right, and unafraid to be politically incorrect." Rich Bott added. "Ted Cruz is the right man running at the right time. He is an answer to prayer, he is in our prayers, and we believe that he will make an exceptional president."
Bott Radio Network stations feature Christian teachers such as Dr. Chuck Swindoll, John MacArthur, Tony Evans, Jack Graham, Dr. Charles Stanley, R.C. Sproul, Dr. Adrian Rogers, and Chip Ingram, along with "Washington Watch" with Tony Perkins and Dick Bott's "The Complete Story". In 2008, Richard P. "Dick" Bott, Sr. was inducted into the National Religious Broadcasters Hall of Fame at the organization's annual convention in Nashville, Tennessee.
"I am glad to have the support of Dick and Rich Bott," Cruz said. "Thousands of Americans have been encouraged by their ministry, broadcasting sound Bible teaching and Christian encouragement into the heartland. Their support is further evidence that, from the ground up, people of faith are answering the call, heading to the polls, and rallying around a consistent conservative who can win."
