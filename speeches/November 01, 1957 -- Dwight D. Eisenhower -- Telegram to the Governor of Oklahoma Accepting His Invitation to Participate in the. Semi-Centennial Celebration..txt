    Honorable Raymond Gary
Governor of Oklahoma
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
I warmly appreciate your renewed invitation on behalf of the State of Oklahoma to participate in its semi-centennial celebration which ends November sixteenth. Upon review of my engagements during the next two weeks I find it possible to schedule the first of my forthcoming addresses to the Nation on November thirteenth. I should be delighted to make that address from Oklahoma City, in that way doing what my time permits to join with Oklahoma in this celebration of its fiftieth birthday this year. I am grateful to you and the people of Oklahoma for re-inviting me and look forward to being there on November thirteenth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
NOTE.: Governor Gary's telegram of October 30, 1957, follows:
Dear Mr. President:
When you wrote me on May 31, 1957, that you could not accept our invitation to visit us on the opening of our America's New Frontiers Exposition in Oklahoma City June 16 you held out hope that you might come to see us in the fall and participate with us in our fiftieth anniversary celebration which ends November 16, the day on which Oklahoma was admitted to statehood in 1907. This is to renew our invitation to you and we sincerely hope you can come on a day that best suits your convenience. We observe from the press that you are planning to address the people of the Nation from points outside the Nation's capital and since Oklahoma is in the midst of celebrating its 50th birthday, as one of the youngest States, it would be appropriate that Oklahoma be selected by you for such an occasion while at the same time joining us in our celebration. We eagerly await your favorable decision.
RAYMOND GARY
