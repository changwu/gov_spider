If you're looking for Election Rigging, look no further. That's what this is. They kept information from the public in order to influence the outcome of the Election. They RIGGED it. @TuckerCarlsonRetweets: 46790Favorites: 205211

How can you give an election to someone who lost the election by hundreds of thousands of legal votes in each of the swing states. How can a country be run by an illegitimate president?Retweets: 43954Favorites: 228392

How does Governor @BrianKempGA allow certification of votes without verifying signatures and despite the recently released tape of ballots being stuffed? His poll numbers have dropped like a rock. He is finished as governor! @RepDougCollinsRetweets: 27723Favorites: 126547

....The fact that our Country is being stolen. A coup is taking place in front of our eyes, and the public can't take this anymore. A Trump fan at Georgia Rally on @OANN Bad!Retweets: 21551Favorites: 113176

People are upset, and they have a right to be. Georgia not only supported Trump in 2016, but now. This is the only State in the Deep South that went for Biden? Have they lost their minds? This is going to escalate dramatically. This is a very dangerous moment in our history....Retweets: 35616Favorites: 167083
