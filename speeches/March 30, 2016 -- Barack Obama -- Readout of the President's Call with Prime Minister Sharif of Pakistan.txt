    President Obama today spoke by phone today with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to express condolences over the recent terrorist attack in Lahore. This callous and appalling attack against innocent civilians, many of them women and children, underscores the critical danger that terrorism poses inside Pakistan, throughout the region, and around the globe. President Obama expressed his understanding of Prime Minister Sharif's decision to cancel his visit to the United States and remain in Pakistan following this terrorist attack. The President reiterated the U.S. commitment to partner with Pakistan to counter terrorism.
