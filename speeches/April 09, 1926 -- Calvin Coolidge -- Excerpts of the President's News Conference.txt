    Here is an inquiry about the Brookhart election case. Of course the Constitution makes the Senate the sole judge of the election and qualification of its own membership and doesn't put any burden of the determination of that question on the Executive, and so I haven't any information about it that warrants my expressing any opinion on the intricate legal questions that I understand are involved in this problem. It is a question of what votes have been cast and what votes ought to be counted. A great many intricate and technical questions axe involved and not having any information on which to base a judgment, I haven't formed any judgment, haven't expressed any, don't expect to make any investigation of the question or express any judgment in relation to it. You want to make that perfectly plain about what I have done and what I expect to do: I haven't made any investigation of the questions involved, formed any opinion of them, expressed or expect to express any opinion in relation to it.
