  A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 308 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-573; 98 Stat. 2948, 3013) and section 128 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2138), I have, through my duly empowered representative, entered into an agreement with Japan to achieve the negotiating objectives under section 104A(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2114A). In order to obtain those objectives, in particular the maximum openness with respect to international trade and investment in high technology products, I have determined that the reduction to zero of existing column i duties provided for in the items of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) listed in section 128 is appropriate.
2. Accordingly, I have determined that the agreement should be implemented and duty-free treatment should be afforded to certain articles enumerated in section 128, effective on or after March 1, 1985. Furthermore, I authorize the United States Trade Representative (USTR), or his designee, on behalf of the United States of America, to modify the TSUS in order to make duty-free treatment effective for the remaining articles set forth in section 128.
3. Pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that technical corrections are necessary in order to implement modifications to the TSUS made by Proclamation 5291 of December 28, 1984 (50 F.R. 223), modifying duties on certain articles used in civil aircraft and on globes. Certain new items in the TSUS created in the Annex to that Proclamation must be redesignated to eliminate numbering conflicts resulting from the redesignation of other provisions by the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to sections 128 and 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 and section 308 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, do proclaim that:
(1) Items 687.72, 687.74, 687.77, 687.81, and 687.85 in part 5 of schedule 6 of the TSUS are modified by striking out, from the column entitled "Rates of Duty 1" for each item, the duty rate "4.2% ad val." and inserting in such column for each item the duty rate "Free". These modifications shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after March 1, 1985.
(2) Item 687.70 in part 5 of schedule 6 of the TSUS is modified by striking out, from the column entitled "Rates of Duty 1" for such item, the duty rate "4.2% ad val." and inserting in such column for such item the duty rate "Free". This modification shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after a date determined by the USTR and published in the Federal Register which is after the effective date of legislation making technical corrections in section 128 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984.
(3) The USTR is hereby authorized to make any other modifications of the TSUS in order to make duty-free treatment effective for the remaining articles covered by section 128.
(4) The Annex to Proclamation 5291 is modified-
(a) by striking out, in the modification numbered 16, the item numbers "708.09" and "708.10" and inserting in lieu thereof "708.10" and "708.12", respectively; and
(b) by striking out, in the modification numbered 17, the item numbers "708.29" and "708.30" and inserting in lieu thereof "708.30" and "708.32", respectively.
These modifications are effective on or after December 28, 1984.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 21st day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.

RONALD REAGAN
