    The United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship. Mr. López and Mr. Ledezma are political prisoners being held illegally by the regime. The United States holds Maduro—who publicly announced just hours earlier that he would move against his political opposition—personally responsible for the health and safety of Mr. López, Mr. Ledezma, and any others seized. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners.
