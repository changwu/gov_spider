    I applaud the decision by the Federal Communications Commission to move forward with the "e-rate"â€”a critical initiative to connect our schools, libraries, and rural health centers to the Internet. Although I had urged that the e-rate be fully funded, I remain committed to the goal of ensuring that every child has access to the tools they need to compete in the 21st century.
The e-rate will help create opportunity in the information age for children and communities all over America. Together with our Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, the e-rate will ensure that for the first time in our Nation's history, a child in the most isolated inner city or rural town will have access to the same universe of knowledge as a child in the most affluent suburb. Parents will be able to communicate more frequently with teachers and keep up with the progress of their child in school. Our children will be "technologically literate" and better prepared for the high-tech, high-wage jobs our economy is creating in record numbers.
I call upon all Members of Congress to support the FCC's decision. I will steadfastly oppose any effort to pull the plug on the e-rate and our children's future or to thwart the FCC's ability to move forward with this initiative.
