    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) MA and 15 others)
The Administration supports enactment of S. 1.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
S. 1 could result in increased receipts to the Federal Government due to provisions in S. 1 that would impose criminal fines against individuals not complying with certain prohibitions related to the sale, purchase, or donation of human fetal tissue. Therefore, S. 1 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
