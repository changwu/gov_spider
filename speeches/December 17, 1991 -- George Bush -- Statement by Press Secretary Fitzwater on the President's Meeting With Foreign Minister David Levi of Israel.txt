    The President met today for approximately 20 minutes in the Oval Office with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levi. Their discussion centered mainly on the United Nations General Assembly's revocation of the "Zionism is racism" determination and on the Middle East peace process. The President expressed his satisfaction with the repeal, calling it a responsible action on the part of the U.N. The President emphasized the importance of not allowing procedural concerns to dominate the peace talks and of seizing this historic opportunity for peace.
