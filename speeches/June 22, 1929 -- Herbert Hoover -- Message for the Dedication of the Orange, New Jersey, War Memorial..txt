My dear Mr. Fariservis:
I know with what emotions of reverent pride and tender memory [p.196] you and the other men and women of Orange will unveil your permanent memorial to the men from Orange who died in the World War. Though it will be impossible for me to be physically present, I shall share them in spirit, and shall, like you, feel that this monument is dedicated not only to those heroic dead but also to the ideal that such sacrifice as theirs may not in future be required.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Walter A. Fariservis, Orange Association for Permanent War Memorial, 429 William Street, East Orange, New Jersey ]
