  A Proclamation

From time immemorial, explorers have sought new frontiers to explore and new worlds to conquer. Their insatiable curiosity, their willingness to face new challenges remain inspirations to the modern world.
Few people can surpass the courage and accomplishments of Leif Erikson, a remarkable representative of a remarkable people. His voyage west to uncharted waters epitomized the virtues of bravery, skill and imagination.
In honoring this great Norseman, we honor the representative of a people whose respect for law and whose early devotion to representative government mirrors our own commitments. We honor, too, Americans of Scandinavian descent, who have made such notable contributions to the development of the United States.
To express our respect for the accomplishments of Leif Erikson and his followers, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849, 36 U.S.C. 169) designated October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, October 9, 1979, as Leif Erikson Day, and I direct the appropriate government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate ceremonies in suitable places throughout the land.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
