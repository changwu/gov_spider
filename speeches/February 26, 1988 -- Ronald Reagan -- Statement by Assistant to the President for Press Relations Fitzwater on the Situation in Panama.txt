    We condemn all efforts to perpetuate military rule in Panama, including efforts to remove President Delvalle from office. We want to reiterate our unqualified support for civilian constitutional rule in Panama. There is but one legitimate sovereign authority in Panama, and that is the Panamanian people exercising their democratic right to vote and elect their leadership in a free society. We have also initiated a series of consultations to learn the views of other countries in the hemisphere with regard to this situation.
