    Evans Praises Lowest Unemployment Insurance Claims Since 2000
Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans praised today's unemployment insurance claims which fell to the lowest level since 2000: "The fewest Americans in three and a half years needed unemployment insurance because our surging economic recovery is creating more and more jobs. The lessons are clear: President Bush's tax relief launched our economy into recovery but a tax increase would stop job growth dead in its tracks. The positive signs of strengthening employment are encouraging but President Bush won't be satisfied until every American can find a job."
