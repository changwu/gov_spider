    Dear Chairman McDonald:
I have been advised that on October 17, 1983 a political committee known as Reagan-Bush '84 whose address is 440 First Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, registered with the Federal Election Commission, as my authorized campaign committee for the nomination as the Republican candidate for the office of the Presidency of the United States in 1984. Since the work of this Committee will be of great help to me at such time as I may make a formal decision to seek a second term as President, I am hereby authorizing this Committee as my principal campaign committee to allow those persons who support my candidacy to express their support in a manner that fully complies with the Federal election laws.
All correspondence directed to me with respect to this matter should be sent to my attention at the Committee's address shown above.
This statement is submitted pursuant to 11 C.F.R. ยง 101.1(a) in lieu of the Statement of Candidacy on FEC Form 2.
I certify that I have examined the information set forth above and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[Mr. Danny Lee McDonald, Chairman, Federal Election Commission, 1325 K Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20463]
