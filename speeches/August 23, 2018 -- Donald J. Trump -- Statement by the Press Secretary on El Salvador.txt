    On Tuesday, the Government of El Salvador announced it would discontinue its decades-long diplomatic relations with Taipei in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing. The leaders of El Salvador's governing party have made this decision, which will have implications for decades to come, in a non-transparent fashion only months before they leave office. This is a decision that affects not just El Salvador, but also the economic health and security of the entire Americas region. The El Salvadoran government's receptiveness to China's apparent interference in the domestic politics of a Western Hemisphere country is of grave concern to the United States, and will result in a reevaluation of our relationship with El Salvador.
Countries seeking to establish or expand relations with China in order to attract state-directed investment that will stimulate short-term economic growth and infrastructure development may be disappointed over the long run. Around the world, governments are waking up to the fact that China's economic inducements facilitate economic dependency and domination, not partnership.
The United States will continue to oppose China's destabilization of the cross-Strait relationship and political interference in the Western Hemisphere.
