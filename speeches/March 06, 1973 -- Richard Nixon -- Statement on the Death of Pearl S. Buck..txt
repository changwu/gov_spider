    IN LIFE Pearl Buck was a human bridge between the civilization of the East and West. With simple eloquence she translated her personal love for the people and culture of China into a rich literary heritage, treasured by Asians and Westerners alike.
She lived a long, full life as artist, wife, mother, and philanthropist. Through her eyes, millions of readers were able to see the beauty of China and its people at a time when direct personal contact was impossible. It is fitting that Pearl Buck lived to see two peoples she loved so much draw closer together during her last years. Mrs. Nixon and I join all Americans in extending our sympathy to her family, and in mourning the passing of a great artist and a sensitive, compassionate human being.
