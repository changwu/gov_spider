    (San Francisco, CA, November 11, 2019) — Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement on Veteran's Day in honor of those who have served our country.
"On Veterans' Day, we honor the brave Americans who have served in the United States Armed Forces, and recognize the sacrifice of those servicemen and women who committed their lives to protecting ours, and our freedom.
"Our veterans answered the call to serve. And on this day, we're reminded that we are a nation built on service. I learned the value of service from my own parents. My father served in the U.S. Navy during WWII. His actions — not just words — ingrained in me the meaning of honor, commitment, and service.
"With our actions, we honor our veterans by following through on the promises we make to them; yes, that means protecting them while on duty, but also afterward. In gratitude for their service, we must do better upon their return to provide pathways to continued education without the burden of student debt, affordable homeownership, and quality long-term mental and physical health care.
"The United States Armed Forces are an all-volunteer force; we source our strength from courage, not coercion. Thank you, to our veterans, and all who put on a uniform. You serve us, and this great country, selflessly. It's our duty to serve you."
