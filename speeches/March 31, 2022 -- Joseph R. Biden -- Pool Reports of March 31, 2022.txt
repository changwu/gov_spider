White House In-Town Pool Report #5 — POTUS concludes 
President Biden finished his prepared remarks at 2.02 p.m.
In response to shouted questions from reporters, he said he expected gas prices to fall "and continue to come down" in response to the oil reserve release.
"It could come down very significantly," the president said, suggesting up to 35 cents a gallon.
He departed the lectern at 2.04 p.m. but returned in response to a question about Vladimir Putin pulling Russian troops back in Ukraine.
There is "no clear evidence" that troops are entirely leaving Ukraine," President Biden said. "I'm a little skeptical."
At 2.05 p.m. he departed for real.

White House In-Town Pool Report #6 — 'Jeopardy!' champion Amy Schneider visits the briefing room
Amy Schneiderman, the first woman to ever win more than $1 million on Jeopardy!, visited the White House briefing room before today's briefing to highlight the administration's observance of the International Transgender Day of Visibility, "to be visible, I suppose," she said.
Schneiderman, who is transgender, told reporters that the recent spate of legislation prohibiting transgender children from participating in school sports or barring teachers from discussing LGBT issues is "really scary."
"Some of them in particular that are denying medical services to trans youth," Schneiderman said, are "really sad to me and it's really frightening."
Schneiderman met with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff earlier today, per the wranglers, and will be meeting with transgender youth to mark the day.

Your pooler tried and failed to word this report in the form of a question, which is why Ms. Schneider has won $1 million on Jeopardy! and your pooler has not.
