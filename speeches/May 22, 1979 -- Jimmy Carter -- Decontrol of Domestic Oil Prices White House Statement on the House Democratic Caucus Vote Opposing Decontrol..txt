    The vote today, of course, was a procedural one, but any thoughts that such votes will change the President's policy are completely misdirected.
The President continues to seek a phased end to controls, coupled with a windfall profits tax to finance an energy security fund to help develop alternative energy forms.
The time for ducking the tough issues is past. Continued controls without cornprehensive, fiscally responsible measures to encourage conservation, reduce imports, increase domestic production, and support alternatives to petroleum is not responsible policy, is a nonanswer to our Nation's energy problems, and is not acceptable to the administration.
