    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 103 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (CFTA) Implementation Act of 1988 (Public Law 100 - 449), I am pleased to submit the attached report and related documents pertaining to a proposed action to proceed with staged tariff reductions on certain plywood originating in Canada in accordance with the provisions of article 2008 of the CFTA, implementation of which had been delayed pending preparation and implementation of common performance standards into the building codes in the United States and Canada.
Sincerely,
George Bush
