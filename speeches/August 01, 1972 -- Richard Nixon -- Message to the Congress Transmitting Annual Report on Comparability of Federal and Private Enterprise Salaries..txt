    To the Congress of the United States:
I am forwarding herewith the annual comparison of Federal salaries in the statutory pay systems to the salaries paid in private enterprise, as required by section 5305 of title 5, United States Code.
The report, prepared by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, compares the General Schedule pay rates to the rates paid in private enterprise for the same levels of work, as published in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin No. 1742, National Survey of Professional, Administrative, Technical and Clerical Pay, June 1971.
No adjustment based upon the comparison was made in Federal pay rates because of the substitute measure enacted as a part of the Economic Stabilization Act Amendments of 1971 (Public Law 92-210, approved December 22, 1971 ).
In addition, the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay reviewed the report and its comments are enclosed.
RICHARD NIXON
