    America has a long tradition of excellence in law enforcement. Throughout the country, in each and every community, citizens expect the highest standards of conduct and character in those men and women who work in this field: honor, integrity, diligence, bravery, and professionalism. Police Week is a fitting time to show our special appreciation for these individuals who render an indispensable service to all of us and who set a splendid example of selflessness and valor.
Police Officers' Memorial Day poignantly reminds us that law enforcement officials face great danger every day of the year. Whether responding to an accident on a dark snow-covered rural highway, or arresting drug dealers in the inner-city, police officers save lives -- often at the risk of their own. Today, we honor those who have fallen in the line of duty. They have paid the greatest price possible for our safety, and this observance is but a small repayment toward the lasting debt we owe to each of them.
I encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt respect and gratitude to the Nation's law enforcement officers, not only during Police Week and Police Officers' Memorial Day, but also throughout the year. These dedicated individuals who uphold the law and protect our lives and property deserve our constant support.
