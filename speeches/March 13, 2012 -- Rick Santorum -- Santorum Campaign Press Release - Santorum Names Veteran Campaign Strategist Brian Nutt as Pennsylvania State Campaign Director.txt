    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce the appointment of Brian Nutt as its Pennsylvania State Director.
Brian Nutt said: "I am honored to join the Santorum campaign. Rick Santorum has been a strong, consistent conservative leader for not just Pennsylvania, but our entire country. I have seen Rick Santorum's leadership first-hand. Senator Santorum stood up when many would back down. He is a fighter, and exactly what our country needs right now. I am excited to join his team and help him win his fifth race in Pennsylvania."
Rick Santorum said: "Brian will be a tremendous addition to our team. He was instrumental in helping Tom Corbett win three statewide races. There are few in Pennsylvania politics with Brian's resume, acumen, and skill. I am looking forward to working with him as we once again work to turn Pennsylvania from Blue to Red."
Brian Nutt has served as Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett's chief political advisor for nearly a decade. Nutt helped guide Corbett's successful Attorney General campaigns, as well as his successful 2010 gubernatorial campaign - where Corbett won election by a double digit margin. During Governor Corbett's transition to the Governor's Office, Nutt served as Corbett's Chief of Staff.
