VP Supplemental Pool #1 — Gathered 
Hellooooo —
I am your pooper for Vice President Harris's first event of the day.
Here's some background from a White House Official:At 10:00am, the Vice President will be joined by Senator Duckworth for a virtual townhall organized by Care Can't Wait, and moderated by Ai-jen Poo, co-founder and Executive Director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The Vice President and the Senator will take questions on the different care policies in the Build Back Better Agenda including childcare, home and community-based care, paid family leave, the Child Tax Credit, and more. And the Vice President will emphasize that these proposals would reduce burdens on women and families, bring more parents into the workforce, and boost economic growth in the long-run.
