    Little Rock, AR -- Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee issued the following comment today in response to recent polls showing growing momentum in Iowa and nationally:
"The numbers show we are climbing, especially in Iowa, but also nationally. The latest Florida poll indicates this is more than a one-state play.
The more we get attacked, the more our numbers soar. This just proves that when you get kicked in the rear, you're really the one out front.
Despite what the pundits have said, there's no substitute for message --and the voters know it."
