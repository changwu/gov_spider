    Following news reports that the Obama-Clinton Iran deal includes provisions that permit Iran to inspect its own alleged nuclear weapons sites, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement:
"The more we learn about the Obama-Clinton Iran deal, the worse it gets. Allowing Iran to inspect its own alleged nuclear sites puts trust in a fanatical regime that's cheated for decades and hates everything we stand for. This deal, and the secret side agreements that continue to emerge, jeopardize our safety and that of our closest allies. That's why I would terminate the disastrous Obama-Clinton Iran deal on my first day as president."
