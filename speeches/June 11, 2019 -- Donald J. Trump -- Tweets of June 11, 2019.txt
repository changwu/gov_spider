New book just out 'The Real Deal My Decade Fighting Battles and Winning Wars With Trump' is really wonderful. It is written by two people who are very smart & know me well George Sorial & Damian Bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who I am. ENJOY!Retweets: 14366Favorites: 65915

'Jerry Nadler's Trump Bashing Show Is A Bust.' Headline New York Post. @foxandfriends The Greatest Witch Hunt of all time continues. All crimes were by the other side but the Committee refuses to even take a look. Deleting 33000 Emails is the real Obstruction - and much more!Retweets: 14958Favorites: 57465

'Mueller has spoken. He found No Collusion between the Trump Campaign and the Russians. The bottom line is what the Democrat House is doing is trying to destroy the Trump Presidency (which has been a tremendous success) and I can assure you that we're done with the Mueller......Retweets: 16308Favorites: 75734

Sad when you think about it but Mexico right now is doing more for the United States at the Border than the Democrats in Congress! @foxandfriendsRetweets: 19140Favorites: 74940

This is because the Euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the U.S. at a big disadvantage. The Fed Interest rate way to high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening! They don't have a clue! https://t.co/0CpnUzJqB9Retweets: 2363Favorites: 7803

...Companies to come to the U.S.A and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. We stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to Mexico. If the Tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass. But very happy with the deal I made...Retweets: 12634Favorites: 68075

....If Mexico produces (which I think they will). Biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed! China is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariff. So far little effect to consumer. Companies will relocate to U.S.Retweets: 12988Favorites: 67770

On my way to Iowa - just heard nearly 1000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging Congress to approve the USMCA. Our Patriot Farmers & rural America have spoken! Now Congress must do its job & support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan USMCA Trade Agreement!Retweets: 19429Favorites: 79048
