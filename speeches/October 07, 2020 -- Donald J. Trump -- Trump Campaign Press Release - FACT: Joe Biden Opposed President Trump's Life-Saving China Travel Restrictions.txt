    It took Joe Biden two months to admit the travel restrictions were a good idea.
Immediately after the World Health Organization declared the China virus a global health emergency on January 30, President Trump acted quickly by instituting restrictions on travel from China — a move experts say saved lives.
Joe Biden opposed the president's ban from the beginning. Biden accused the president of acting irrationally the day the restrictions were announced, and said he was engaging in "hysterical xenophobia."


On January 28, Biden's coronavirus advisor Ron Klain said he opposed restricting travel from China.

On March 26, the Biden campaign would only tell The Washington Post that travel restrictions "can be warranted" – again refusing to say that President Trump made the right call. 

It took Biden more than two months to finally admit he thought the travel restrictions were a good idea:


Biden National Press Secretary TJ Ducklo refused to say if Biden supported President Trump's decision in January.

Biden advisor Jake Sullivan had no answer when asked why it took Biden two months to support President Trump's travel restrictions.

If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would be dead: Joe Biden was behind the curve, while President Trump's response to the coronavirus saved American lives.
