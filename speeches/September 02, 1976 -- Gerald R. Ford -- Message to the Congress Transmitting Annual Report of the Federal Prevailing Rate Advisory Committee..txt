To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 5347(e) of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby transmit to you the 1975 Annual Report of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.
In March of this year, I sent to the Congress a legislative proposal to reform procedures for setting pay under the prevailing rate system. In my July 22, 1976 legislative program message, I urged action on the proposal before adjournment of the 94th Congress. I am convinced that the bill will help correct inconsistencies in the prevailing rate system and I wish to reiterate my concern for its passage.
