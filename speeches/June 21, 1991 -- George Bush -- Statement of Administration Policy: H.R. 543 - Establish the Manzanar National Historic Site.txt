    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/24/91)(House)(Levine (D) California and 30 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 543 but will seek an amendment in the Senate to delete requirements for a landmark theme study of key sites in Japanese-American history. The Administration supports the establishment of the Manzanar National Historic Site, but opposes a new theme study because such sites have been thoroughly considered for designation as part of a previous theme study.
