    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders joined Rep. Keith Ellison and faith leaders at a mosque Wednesday to call on leaders around the country to denounce Islamophobia and embrace the Muslim-American community.
"It is time to say enough is enough" Sanders said during an interfaith roundtable hosted at Masjid Muhammad in Washington. "It is time to end religious bigotry. It is time to build a nation in which we all stand together – Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and all religions – and work to create a nation that works for all of us. So today I am calling on all of us in public life, including my fellow candidates for president, and all Americans to condemn anti-Muslim hatred and to say "no" to those who promote this hatred a stand up to those who seek to reduce the Muslim people to ugly stereotypes."
Sanders was also joined by Masjid Muhammad's Imam Talib Shareef, Rev. Reginald Green, who was a Freedom Rider in Mississippi during the civil rights movement, Rabbi Batya Steinlauf, the director of social justice and intergroup relations at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and Chaplain Abdul Rasheed Muhammad, the first Muslim chaplain in the U.S. armed forces.
