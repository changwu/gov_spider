    Today, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (WPR), the President transmitted to the Congress a report notifying the Congress that he had authorized U.S. Armed Forces to conduct targeted airstrikes in support of an operation to deliver humanitarian assistance to the town of Amirli, where thousands of Shia Turkomen have been cut off from receiving food, water, and medical supplies for two months by ISIL.
The United States Air Force delivered aid to the town of Amirli alongside aircraft from Australia, France and the United Kingdom, who also dropped much needed supplies.

This operation is consistent with the military missions we have outlined to date in Iraq â€” to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to address the humanitarian situation on the ground.
These operations are limited in their nature, duration, and scope and are being undertaken in coordination with and at the request of the Government of Iraq.

The Administration will continue to consult with the Congress on the way forward in Iraq and our efforts against ISIL, and we will continue to provide appropriate reports to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution.
