    The President. I know their music speaks for itself; but I just wanted, on behalf of all of you I know, to thank the Beach Boys for coming here on this very special occasion.
We were looking forward to seeing them on the Fourth of July. I'm glad they got here early.
But, we're very honored and proud to have you here at the White House, which is everybody's house, belongs to all of us. And it is a great honor, and I know that you've had to sandwich this in to do it. But I know also that you did it because of the way you feel about this very special occasion, too- [applause] .-
And if you didn't believe that our whole family have been fans of yours for a long time, just look at Nancy. [Laughter]
Mr. Love. [Inaudible] I can tell that. She's a California girl, what the heck. [Laughter]
The President. Well, again, God bless you all, and thank you very much.
The Beach Boys. Thank you.
