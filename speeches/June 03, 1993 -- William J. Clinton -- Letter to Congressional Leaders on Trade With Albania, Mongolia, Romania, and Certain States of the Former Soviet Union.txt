    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit the documents referred to in section 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1)) ("the Act"), with respect to a further 12-month extension of the authority to waive sections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act. These documents constitute my recommendation to continue in effect the waiver authority for a further 12-month period, and include my reasons for determining that continuation of the waiver authority and waivers currently in effect for Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act. Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
