    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4491, but will seek amendments in the Senate to delete:

—  section 3, which would authorize Federal expenditures for a bridge which should be maintained and improved with local funds;
—  section 7, which would cast doubt on the Coast Guard's ability to impose adequate bonding requirements on its contractors;
—  sections 9, 10, 11, and 14, which would inappropriately provide for the transfer of Federal property without following established procedures for disposal of Federal real property;
—  section 12, which would delay improvements in the Coast Guard's automated information system; and
—  section 15, which would authorize appropriations of $6 million for transfer to the University of Alaska to establish a cold water survival school. This inappropriate earmarking would detract from other, higher priority, Coast Guard programs.
