    Today, Ohio Senate Minority Leader Kenny Yuko and 21 Ohio leaders announced their endorsements for Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"Before fighting for Ohioans in the State Senate, I was fighting on the front lines for our unions. And I can tell you beyond the shadow of a doubt that Ohio's unions and laborers will have no greater champion in Washington than Joe Biden. Vice President Biden knows the necessity of making sure our working families have a level playing field, and he cares about and advocates for those same dinner table issues they do: Education, health care, infrastructure, fighting climate change, and good-paying jobs. With Joe Biden in the White House, we can again be optimistic about what lies ahead for Ohio, and the future our kids will be able to experience." â€” Ohio Senate Minority Leader Kenny Yuko
