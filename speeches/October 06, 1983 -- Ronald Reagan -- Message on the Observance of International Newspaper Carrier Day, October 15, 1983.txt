    I am delighted to extend my warm congratulations and appreciation to those who deliver our newspapers as we observe International Newspaper Carrier Day.
This occasion provides a welcome opportunity for me to express my high regard for your role in keeping Americans informed. Millions of our citizens depend on you to receive the essential and timely in-depth information that only newspapers bring to our daily lives.
As part of the communication industry of our democracy, you play a valuable part in the development of an educated and knowledgeable electorate. I commend your contributions to a strong America.
