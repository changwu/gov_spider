    I am very concerned by the Supreme Court's decision to allow S.B. 8 to remain in effect in light of the significant consequences that law has for women in Texas and around the country, and for the rule of law. As I have made clear from day one, I am deeply committed to the constitutional right recognized in Roe v. Wade nearly 5 decades ago.
While it is encouraging that the Court ruled that part of the providers' lawsuit may continue, this ruling reinforces that there is so much more work to be done: in Texas, in Mississippi, and in many States around the country where women's rights are currently under attack. I will continue to work with Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act. We have more work to do, but I will always stand with women to protect and defend their long-recognized, constitutional right under Roe v. Wade.
