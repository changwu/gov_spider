    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Emerson (R) Missouri and 71 others)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) consistent with the President's budget. However, the Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3533 because it would require unnecessary and costly modifications to the program. Specifically, H.R. 3533 is objectionable because it would:

—  Authorize appropriations that exceed the President's budget by $31 million in FY 1991 and $231 million for FYs 1991-1994 for all four NEHRP agencies.
—  Require minimum levels of funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that would impose unnecessary constraints on its support for earthquake-related research and adversely affect other high-priority NSF research programs.
—  Confer unrealistic responsibilities on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with respect to the NEHRP's content and budgetary matters.
—  Outline in statute specific agency responsibilities at a level of detail that would inappropriately restrict agency flexibility to effectively administer and respond to differing needs of earthquake hazard areas.
—  Impose statutory requirements that would dilute levels of State and local financial support for the State seismic safety assistance program.
—  Mandate fixed deadlines for the Federal Government to establish seismic safety standards for existing Federal and Federally-assisted buildings. These deadlines may be unrealistic given the need for more research in this area. Moreover, the bill fails to address the need for any such standards to be cost-effective.
—  Require the Office of Science and Technology Policy to report to Congress on how it can play a role in coordination, planning, and operation of the program. Such responsibilities would duplicate the lead agency role and that of the proposed advisory committee.
