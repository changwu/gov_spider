Maria is badly needed in Washington. She is an outstanding person who truly loves her Country and her State. Her opponent, @DonnaShalala, is a political hack who is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi. She does nothing for Florida. Maria has my Complete & Total Endorsement!  https://t.co/4GumAgOA3JRetweets: 17408Favorites: 69800

Thank you to Dave Rubin, author of Don't Burn This Book, just announced on @foxandfriends that he is voting for your favorite President, me. I think Donald Trump has done a lot of good. When I see an American flag, I see Trump support.Retweets: 18696Favorites: 101612

GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.Retweets: 37557Favorites: 159775

So it turns out that the wise guy promoted as Anonymous by the @nytimes, named Miles Taylor (who I never even heard of!), was only a little known staffer as opposed to a Senior Administration Official. He then scammed @CNN, lied to @andersoncooper, & got a job there....Retweets: 19318Favorites: 84400

A 3 day extension for Pennsylvania is a disaster for our Nation, and for Pennsylvania itself. The Democrats are trying to steal this Election. We have to get out and VOTE in even larger numbers. The Great Red Wave is coming!!!Retweets: 35011Favorites: 151943

This election is a choice between the AMERICAN DREAM and a SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE. Our opponents want to turn America into Communist Cuba or Socialist Venezuela. As long as I am President, America will NEVER be a socialist Country! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc Retweets: 17500Favorites: 69044

For half a century, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician—If Biden Wins, China Wins. When We Win, Florida Wins—and America Wins! https://t.co/UdqQqmxvL7Retweets: 18153Favorites: 74695

If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm NOT a politician. If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPchttps://t.co/kCtPkRWdY4Retweets: 24451Favorites: 106116

Failed RINO former Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was a disaster with respect to the Flint Water CATASTROPHE, and a very bad Governor overall. He hurt so many people with his gross incompetence. He reminds me of Sleepy Joe!Retweets: 20252Favorites: 101655

My Administration has suspended the entry of refugees from terror-compromised nations such as Syria, Somalia and Yemen. Biden's plan surges refugees 700% into Minnesota, Michigan & Pennsylvania—burdening schools & hospitals while opening the floodgates to Radical Islamic Terror.Retweets: 37512Favorites: 148332
