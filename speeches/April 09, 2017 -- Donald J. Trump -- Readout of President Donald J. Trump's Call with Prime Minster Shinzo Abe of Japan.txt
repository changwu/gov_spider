    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan about recent developments in Syria. The leaders agreed that Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons against civilians, including women and children, was abhorrent and warranted a strong response from the international community. President Trump thanked Prime Minister Abe for his support for the United States missile strikes in Syria, and the two leaders pledged to show continued resolve in response to al-Assad's brutal actions. President Trump and Prime Minister Abe also agreed to further cooperation on a range of regional issues, including the threat posed by North Korea.
