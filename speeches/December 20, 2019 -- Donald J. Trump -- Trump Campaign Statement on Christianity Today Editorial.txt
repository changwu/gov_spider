    "The impeachment proceedings brought on by the Democrats in the House have not only caused anger, but also further division among the American people. The media bias that has been apparent for the past three years has taken a dramatic turn to be even more divisive. I was outraged when I saw that Christianity Today – a publication that my grandfather founded – used his name to support their personal political agenda.
"President Trump has followed through on his promises made to the people of the United States. He has overcome historic opposition since day one of his term. However, he continues to work hard for the American people. He believes in this country. I believe he has been put in this position for a time such as this. He has had the courage to stand for things that no other man in his position has had the courage to do – protecting the U.S. Constitution and the belief of our forefathers that we are one nation under God; supporting our biggest ally in the Middle East, Israel; and appointing judges that will protect religious liberty. He is the only president in recent history that has stood up for the most vulnerable in our society – the unborn.
"I believe that we are called to honor those in authority. Today, I am praying fervently for President Trump, his family, his administration, and all of our leaders that are fighting for the US people. I continue to be thankful for President Trump's leadership and resilience when faced with hate and attacks from all sides."
