    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Young (R) Alaska and 2 cosponsors)
The Administration supports H.R. 715.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 715 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
