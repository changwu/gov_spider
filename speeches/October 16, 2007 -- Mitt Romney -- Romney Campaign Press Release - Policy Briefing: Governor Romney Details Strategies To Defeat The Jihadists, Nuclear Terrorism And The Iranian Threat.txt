Governor Mitt Romney Addresses The Republican Jewish Coalition
Key Excerpts Of Governor Romney's Remarks At The Republican Jewish Coalition's Presidential Candidates Forum (As Prepared For Delivery):
Governor Romney: "In the face of the global radical Jihadist threat, many in the Democratic party are in the most serious, delusional and politically-driven denial since Neville Chamberlain."
Governor Romney: "We may need more than an expanded NATO. ... We should build regional alliances linked to a global NATO in areas like the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. These regional alliances could provide personnel with localized knowledge and cultural awareness to address emerging crises."
Governor Romney: "To match and defeat international Jihadist networks we also need new types of arrangements that are agile and cutting edge. I believe we must build a Global Network Against Terror and Transnational Threats. This would link intelligence and law enforcement capabilities around the world, sharing data about border crossings, biometric indicators, passport fraud, nuclear and biological threats, criminal patterns, human and drug trafficking."
Governor Romney: "Building alliances also means speaking clearly when institutions fail. The United Nations has failed to contain aggression, failed to stop proliferation, and failed to prevent genocide. Its failures stem from the lack of a community of interest and values by its members. What we need are new international structures in which only free nations are invited to work together for basic shared goals. We will not withdraw from the UN – we need a body where the whole world can talk. But we also need bodies where the free world can act. The UN Human Rights Council, however, has a particularly repugnant record. It has repeatedly targeted Israel, while remaining virtually silent in the face of egregious violations by the world's worst human rights abusers: Iran, Burma, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, Zimbabwe and Syria. It is time to end U.S. support for this sad spectacle – the United States should withdraw immediately from the UN Human Rights Council."
Governor Romney: "Until only recently, too many American leaders remained silent while the Iranian regime tortured dissidents, funded terrorists targeting Americans and Israelis, subjugated and stoned women, threatened the destruction of Israel, and rushed toward nuclear weapons. This was not just under Ahmadinejad. Former Iranian President Khatami referred to Hezbollah, as the 'shining sun that illuminates and warms the hearts of all Muslims and supporters of freedom in the world.' Yet when Harvard invited Khatami to give an address on the eve of the 5th Anniversary of 9/11, the media and Washington elites praised him as a 'moderate.' I took a different course. I was asked to have my state police lead his convoy to Harvard, I said no way."
Governor Romney's Foreign Policy Imperatives:
First, We Must Succeed In Iraq And In Afghanistan. At a minimum, success means not leaving behind a safe haven in Iraq and Afghanistan for Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups, from which they can finance, train and launch devastating attacks on America, Israel, and the world. In Iraq, the Surge's success has been vital to ensuring that Al Qaeda is denied a safe haven from which to launch attacks.
Second, Iran Must Be Stopped. The Iranian regime denies the Holocaust, threatens Israel with destruction, funds terrorists targeting Americans and Israelis, commits flagrant human rights abuses and rushes toward nuclear weapons capabilities. The world must act now to stop the Iranian regime and their deadly actions.
- Governor Romney Has Proposed A Comprehensive Strategy To Prevent A Nuclear Iran. In January 2007 at the Herzilya Conference in Israel, Governor Romney outlined a plan that will tighten economic sanctions against the Iranian regime; isolate Iran diplomatically and indict Iran's President Ahmadinejad for inciting genocide; enlist Arab states to join our efforts; make clear to the Iranian people the peril of acquiring nuclear capabilities; and maintain the military option.

Third, The United States Will Defend Israel. Governor Romney is committed to the integrity of Israel as a Jewish nation. He makes this guarantee because Israel is a key strategic ally in the global war against radical Jihadists, because of our respect for the Israeli people, and because the world has a moral obligation to this nation.
Fourth, We Must Prevent Nuclear Material From Ending Up In The Hands Of Terrorists. While there is a threat of nuclear material from nations like Iran falling into the hands of terrorists, we must be vigilant in preventing terrorists and Jihadists from acquiring what are commonly known as "loose nukes." At Yeshiva University in April 2007, Governor Romney proposed a comprehensive strategy to guard against this nuclear peril by:
- Appointing An Ambassador-At-Large To Prevent Nuclear Proliferation With The Authority To Lead American Efforts.
- Making Nuclear Trafficking A Crime Against Humanity On Par With Genocide And War Crimes.
- Updating The Non-Proliferation Treat To Meet Today's Challenges.
- Establishing A "Gold Standard" For Securing Nuclear Materials Around The World.
- Creating An International Fuel Bank To Supply Nuclear Fuel To Countries That Abide By Very High Standards Of Safety And Security.

Fifth, We Must Defeat Radical Jihad. At the George Bush Presidential Library Center in April 2007, Governor Romney outlined a strategy to defeat radical jihad around the world by:
- Strengthening Our Military. Governor Romney will add at least 100,000 more troops to our Armed Forces and commit at least 4% of our gross domestic product to defense. We need to make long overdue investments in equipment, armament, weapon systems, and strategic defense.
- Achieving Energy Independence. Energy independence is vital to our national defense and our economic security. Governor Romney has called for a bold and far-reaching research initiative to create new, economic sources of clean energy. We must invest in renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and liquefied coal. American resolve and investment are essential for energy security and national security.
- Fundamentally Rethinking And Revitalizing Civilian And Interagency Capabilities. Building on the Goldwater-Nichols military reforms of the 1980s, we need bold new reforms to ensure that our civilian and inter-agency instruments of national power have the ability to build joint efforts. For example, just as the different military branches have divided the world into regions with a single commander for each, our civilian agencies should be united under a single Presidential envoy or Deputy for each region of the world. These Deputies will have clear lines of authority, budgets and responsibility to develop and execute regional plans and strategies.
- Strengthening Our Alliances And Inaugurating New Ones. In January 2007, Governor Romney called for expanding NATO by making it a global alliance and expanding its mission to defeat radical Islam. Governor Romney proposes building regional alliances linked to a global NATO in areas like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. These regional alliances will provide personnel with localized knowledge and cultural awareness to address emerging crises and threats.
- Governor Romney Will Build A Global Network Against Terror And Transnational Threats To Link Intelligence From Around The World. The Global Network Against Terror and Transnational Threats will link intelligence and law enforcement capabilities around the world to share data about border crossings, biometric indicators, passport fraud, nuclear and biological threats, criminal patterns, human trafficking and drug trafficking.
- Governor Romney Calls On The United States To Immediately Withdraw From The U.N. Human Rights Council And Build New Efforts With Nations Committed To Freedom. Building effective alliances means speaking clearly when institutions fail. The United Nations has failed to contain aggression, stop proliferation, and prevent genocide. America should not withdraw from the U.N. but we need a body where the free world can act. However, the U.N. Human Rights Council has a particularly repugnant record – repeatedly targeting Israel while remaining silent in the face of the world's worst human rights abusers. The U.S. should withdraw immediately from the U.N. Human Rights Council.
