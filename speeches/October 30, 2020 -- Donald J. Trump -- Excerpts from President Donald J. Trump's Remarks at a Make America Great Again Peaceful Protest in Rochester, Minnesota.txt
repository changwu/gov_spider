Your far-left Democrat Attorney General, Keith Ellison, and your Democrat Governor tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom of assembly.
...
They thought we would cancel—but I will NEVER abandon Minnesota!
...
Keith Ellison sided with flag-burning extremists over law-abiding Americans. He treats you like second-class citizens. He believes that pro-American voters have fewer rights than Anti-American demonstrators.
...
The Radical Left is hell-bent on destroying the Middle Class – they think they can take your money, attack your values, indoctrinate your children, and silence your voices.
...
We are not just running against Joe Biden—we are running against the arrogant far-left political class. They want one set of rules for you—and NO rules for themselves.
...
They treat law enforcement like criminals, and they treat criminals like heroes.
...
They ban you from going to church, while they let left-wing extremists burn down the church. They support crippling shutdowns that crush blue collar jobs, while their own jobs remain totally exempt.
...
There is only one way to defend your dignity. There is only one way to defend your family and your country. There is only one way to preserve, protect and defend the American Way of Life: you must show up and vote on November 3rd.
...
On November 3rd, vote to defeat Joe Biden and SAVE AMERICAN FREEDOM.
...
Joe Biden is a grimy, sleazy and corrupt career politician who has done nothing but betray you for 47 long years. He will look you in the eye, and then turn right around and stab you in the back. The only thing he cares about is political power.
...
If you want strong borders, strong families, safe communities, a thriving economy, then I am asking for your vote on November 3rd!
...
"One of the biggest issues for Minnesota in this election is the subject of refugees. This is a matter of National Security. To protect our country, I suspended the entry of refugees from foreign nations compromised by terrorism – including from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. We are keeping Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country!
Biden has pledged a staggering 700 percent increase in refugees from the most dangerous and violent terrorist hot spots on earth. He has also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones, and terrorist havens. Biden's deadly migration policies will overwhelm taxpayers and open the floodgates to terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists. Under my Administration, the safety of our families will always come FIRST."
...
With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our military, defend our borders, protect the 2nd amendment, protect religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with the phrase MADE IN THE USA! Yesterday it was announced that last quarter, our economy grew at the fastest rate EVER recorded.
...
Joe Biden will ship your factories to China, impose a $4 trillion dollar tax hike, eliminate private healthcare, abolish the entire oil industry, and send your state into a crippling depression.
...
Biden will also continue his 47 years of cruelly betraying African-Americans – he called them super-predators, ripped apart their communities, and did everything in his power to wipe out the Black Middle Class.
...
Joe Biden's plan will delay the vaccine, postpone therapies, crash the economy, and shut down our entire country.
...
Under my plan, we will deliver a SAFE VACCINE to the American People in just a few short weeks!
...
We will wipe out the China Plague once and for all!
...
A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American Dream, and the party of Abraham Lincoln!
...
Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.
...
We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of ASSEMBLY, and the right to KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.
...
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students, and restore PATRIOTIC EDUCATION to our schools.
...
We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American Flag.
...
We are ONE movement, ONE people, ONE family, and ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD!
