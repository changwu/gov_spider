    Today's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to allow the FTC to enforce the Do-Not-Call Registry is a victory for Americans who want to reduce the nuisance of unwanted telephone solicitations. The American people have the right to limit annoying telemarketing calls, and I am pleased that both the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission will now be able to ensure that Americans have that choice while the courts continue to consider the issues.
