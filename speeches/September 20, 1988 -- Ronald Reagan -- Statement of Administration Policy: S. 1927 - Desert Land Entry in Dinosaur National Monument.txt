    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised - LA)
(House)(Hatch (R) Utah)
While the Administration has no objection to enactment to S. 1927 as passed by the Senate, the Administration strongly opposes the bill as reported by the House Interior Committee. As reported, S. 1927 includes an unrelated amendment to require the Secretary of the Interior to complete a specified land exchange with an individual who is constructing a home on land that, in part, has been determined to be Federal property. Such a requirement would represent an undesirable precedent that could encourage others to trespass freely on Federal land.
Accordingly, the Secretary of the Interior would recommend that the President veto S. 1927 if it is presented in its current form.
