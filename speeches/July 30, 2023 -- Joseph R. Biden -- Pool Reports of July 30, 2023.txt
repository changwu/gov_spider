Out of town pool report #2 - Biden at the beach
At 2:56 pm the president's SUV stopped not far from the pool.
The First Lady exited wearing a blue skirt, flip flops, a baseball cap and a white top. She was carrying a bag and what looked like a towel.
The president is sporting bright blue shorts, a navy blue T-shirt, a baseball cap and sneakers. He was also carrying a bag and a towel.
A few onlookers had gathered and there were shouts of "Four more years!" Dr Biden waved at them.
FLOTUS and POTUS then walked to the beach.
The pool followed and got a glimpse from a distance.
Both are sitting on lounge chairs under an umbrella. Dr Biden is reading a book while the president is reading some papers.
The president did not stop to chat with the press and on the beach we were too far away to shout questions.
At 3:08 your pool was escorted away.

Out of town pool #3 - Leaving the beach and lid
At 6:03 pm the president and the First Lady left the beach.
They both waved at a little group of supporters assembled nearby, one of them shouting "We love you Joe", before entering their car, and then drove away.
The president did not engage with the pool, there were shouted questions about Haiti, Niger and what he had been reading on the beach.
And at 6:11 pm we have a lid. That's all from me, many thanks to co pooler Meryl Kornfield (Washington Post). Have a nice evening!
