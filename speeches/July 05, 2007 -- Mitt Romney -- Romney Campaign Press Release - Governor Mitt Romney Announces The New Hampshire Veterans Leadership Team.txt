Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President New Hampshire Veterans Leadership Team comprised of 41 veterans representing all ten counties in the State. The New Hampshire Veterans Leadership Team will play an important role in helping to spread Governor Romney's message of strong, conservative values throughout the State.
"Since the founding of this nation, veterans have played an integral role in defending American values and our nation's security. Their sacrifice and devotion have provided each passing generation the opportunity to continue to spread America's message of hope and freedom. The support of these brave men and women will be crucial to my victory in the Granite State, and I am proud to have them on my team," said Governor Romney.
Leading Governor Romney's New Hampshire Veterans Leadership Team is Mike Moffett. A Marine infantry officer during Desert Storm in 1991, he is a member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. From 2001-2002, Moffett served on General Franks' Central Command Operations Staff.
In a statement, Chairman Mike Moffett said, "As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney served as an invaluable champion of veterans' causes. We know that the Governor will continue to work tirelessly to guarantee that every veteran is honored for their service. He will be a strong Commander-in-Chief, and we will work together to make sure New Hampshire voters know he is the best candidate to lead our nation."
