Excerpts from President Donald J. Trump's address to the 75th Annual Alfred E.

Your work reminds us of an essential truth: In this country, civil society—and especially our religious institutions—are an essential foundation of American freedom....As President, one of my top priorities is to defend religious liberty and the cherished role of faith and faith-based organizations in our national life....To protect your God-given rights, I was recently honored to nominate one of our most brilliant legal minds, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to the United States Supreme Court....To support the noble mission of Catholic schools, my administration is working to advance School Choice....Few institutions in history have done more for New York, more for America, or more for people of the world than the Catholic Church....Now more than ever, our nation needs a renewal of the values that this organization promotes and that the Catholic faithful live out each and every day in peace....As President, I will always support you in your effort to serve our fellow citizens and to lift up all humanity. I will protect the Catholic Church, and I will defend the rights of religious believers of every race, religion, color, and creed.
