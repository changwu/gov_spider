    Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement tonight following the passage of a minimum wage bill:
This is a great day for working New Mexico families," Governor Bill Richardson said. "Raising the minimum wage is the crown jewel of our legislative agenda. Combined, this wage increase and the $52 million in tax cuts that I signed into law today are a major victory for working New Mexicans.
"I'd like to especially thank Senate President Pro Tem Ben Altamirano for his tireless leadership on this issue for the past two sessions. Â And I thank House Speaker Ben Lujan for his willingness to accept a bill that could pass both chambers."
