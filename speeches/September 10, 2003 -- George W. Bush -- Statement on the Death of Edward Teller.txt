    Edward Teller was a tireless patriot and great American who devoted much of his life to making Americans more secure. During his life, Dr. Teller received honors including the National Medal of Science and, in July, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His notable contributions to the security of our Nation will not be forgotten. Laura joins me in sending condolences to his family.
