    DELANO, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday stopped at the former headquarters of Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers union.
Federico Chavez, a nephew of the labor leader and civil rights activist, led the senator on a tour of The Forty Acres, once the headquarters for the first agricultural labor union in the United States.
"This is a historic area," Sanders said of the place where Chavez staged a hunger strike that helped lead to a collective bargaining contract for farmworkers.
"While progress has been made, there is no question that a lot more needs to be done," Sanders said. Farmworkers continue to be exploited and exposed to pesticides. He also voiced concerns about tainted water supplies that have made tap water undrinkable in many communities in the area. "The people that have to be held responsible are the corporations," he added.
