    When the votes are counted tonight, millions of American voters will have participated in primaries, caucuses, and conventions from New Hampshire to California. This is a uniquely important election year for our country, and I commend every American, Republican, Democrat, or independent, who has made their voice heard by attending a caucus, casting a ballot, or signing a petition.
As November approaches, I believe there will be two questions foremost in the minds of American voters: Who has the best ideas for America? Who do you trust to lead this country? With an unbroken string of primary victories behind us, I will continue to present my credentials and ideas to the American people.
To our supporters, Barbara and I say thank you for your confidence and trust. Tonight we extend a hand to every Republican. To all Americans who share our values and commitment to building a better America, we invite you to join us. Together this November, we can break the Washington lawmaking gridlock and set a new course for the next American century.
