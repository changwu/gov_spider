    Today, Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Today I enthusiastically endorse Joe Biden for president. I admire Joe for his head and his heart. He has the experience, intellect, and passion to draw people together and move our country forward for the many — for us all. He has spent a lifetime serving others, honoring and believing in our Constitution, and working tirelessly, yet optimistically, to form a more perfect union. More important to me, is Joe's humanity. Joe is a decent person with a deep faith in our country and his fellow Americans. Joe's empathy, turning personal terrible losses into a greater purpose, is an inspiration to me, and a unifying quality that our country needs to win back the White House—bringing decency, humanity, and leadership to our nation's highest office."
Known as Pennsylvania's third Senator, Biden has widespread support from across the state, including Senator Bob Casey, Congressman Matt Cartwright, Congressman Conor Lamb, Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan, Congressman Dwight Evans, Congressman Brendan Boyle, former Governor Ed Rendell, and dozens of other state legislators and local leaders.
Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 70 U.S. Representatives and nine U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
