    We are pleased to have obtained official confirmation from the Syrian Government on Saturday of the lifting of restrictions on travel and disposition of property for the Syrian Jewish community.
The Syrian Government has now informed us that, in the aftermath of President Assad's recent meeting with the leaders of Syria's Jewish community, all members of the Syrian Jewish community will be accorded the same rights as those enjoyed by all other Syrian citizens. We have been told that Syrian Jews will be allowed to travel abroad as families, on business, and for vacations. Further, the Syrian Government has removed difficulties encountered by its Jewish citizens with regard to the sale and purchase of property. The Syrian Government has also released the Soued brothers, who had been imprisoned for violating Syrian travel laws.
We welcome these decisions by President Assad and his Government. This administration has maintained a productive dialog with Syria's leadership on a number of important issues, including the peace process. The subject of Syrian Jewry has constituted an integral part of this dialog and has been raised by both President Bush and Secretary Baker with President Assad and other senior Syrian officials. We look forward to the full implementation of these decisions affecting Syrian Jews.
