    YOUNGSTOWN, OH - Middleweight boxing champion and Youngstown native Kelly "The Ghost" Pavlik announced his endorsement of Hillary for president. The Champ made his endorsement announcement on stage with Hillary Clinton today at the "Solutions For America" Rally at Austintown-Fitch High School.
"Hillary Clinton is my kind of fighter. She's experienced and tough enough to deliver the changes Youngstown and Ohio need," Pavlik said. "She'll fight for the good jobs we need to get our economy moving again and stand up for working people everywhere. I know that as president she'll come out swinging on Day 1 and never stop fighting for us. I am proud to support her for president."
Born and raised in Youngstown, Pavlik is the undefeated WBC and WBO middleweight champion. He earned his title and his place as the Pride of Youngstown by defeating Jermain Taylor in two straight bouts. He was named "Fighter of the Year" for 2007 by Sports Illustrated.
"Kelly Pavlik is a great champion and I am honored to have him in my corner. He embodies the best values of Youngstown: hard work, a fighting spirit, and a whole lot of heart," Hillary said. "The people of Youngstown need a president who will fight for them as hard as Kelly Pavlik does, to jumpstart the economy, to create the good, high-paying jobs of the future, and to rebuild the middle class."
