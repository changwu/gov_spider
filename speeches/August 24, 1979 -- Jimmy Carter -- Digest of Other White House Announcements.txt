The White House announced that the President will answer questions from the public in a live, 2-hour radio broadcast from the Oval Office on Saturday, October 13. The program will be produced by National Public Radio and will be heard on most NPR member stations from 1 to 3 p.m. (EDT) on October 13. Anyone who wishes to talk with the President is requested to send a postcard to: "Ask the President," P.O. Box 19369, Washington, D.C. 20036, listing name, address, and telephone number. The questions a caller would like to ask should not be given on the card. Just prior to the broadcast, NPR will choose callers at random from the postcards and connect the persons selected with the President as lines become available. Susan Sramberg, cohost of "All Things Considered," will anchor the program for NPR and will introduce each caller to the President and the radio audience.
The White House announced that Ray Jenkins, editor of the Montgomery Advertiser and Alabama Journal, will join the White House staff in early September as a Special Assistant to the President.
