    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Charles B. Curtis to be the Under Secretary of Energy. After he is confirmed, he will assume management responsibility for science and technology programs, weapons and waste cleanup programs, and energy policy matters assigned by the Secretary.
"There are few Americans who can match Charles Curtis' governmental experience or his knowledge of energy policy," said the President. "He will be an outstanding addition to Secretary O'Leary's team at the Energy Department."
