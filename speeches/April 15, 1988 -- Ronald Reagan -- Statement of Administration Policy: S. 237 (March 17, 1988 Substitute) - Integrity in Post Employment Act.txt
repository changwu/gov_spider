    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Thurmond (R) SC and three others)
The Administration opposes enactment of the substitute for S. 237 that was introduced on March 17, 1988, intended to be offered on the Senate floor. If this substitute were to reach the President's desk in its present form, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed.
The March 17, 1988, substitute is objectionable because it imposes sweeping restrictions on post-employment activity of former Members of Congress, Federal judges, and executive and legislative branch employees that:

— are arbitrary because they are generally divorced from the former employees' duties and responsibilities during Federal service;
— are unnecessary to correct any actual abuses involving representation of either foreign or domestic entities;
— will permanently impair the Government's ability to attract and retain high quality individuals for the public service; and
— will prevent former employees from legitimate and perfectly proper efforts to earn a living after leaving Government service.
