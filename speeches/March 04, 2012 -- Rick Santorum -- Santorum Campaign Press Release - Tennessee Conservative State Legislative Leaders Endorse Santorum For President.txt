    Verona, PA - After an extended visit with Tennessee legislators while in Nashville this week, Senator Rick Santorum picked up endorsements of some of the state's most ardent conservatives. From Jonesborough to Dresden, a dozen State Representatives were eager to endorse the candidate they feel carries the values of Tennesseans and has the best chance to beat President Obama in the fall - Rick Santorum.
Included in the list of supporters are:
Representative Sheila Butt (R- Columbia)
Representative Jimmy Matlock (R - Lenoir City)
Representative Bill Dunn (R- Knoxville)
Representative Don Miller (R- Morristown)
Representative Joshua Evans (R - Greenbrier)
Representative Mark Pody (R- Lebanon)
Representative Joey Hensley, MD (R- Hohenwald)
Representative Dennis Powers (R- Jacksboro)
Representative Matthew Hill (R - Jonesborough)
Representative Art Swann (R- Maryville)
Representative Andy Holt (R - Dresden)
Representative Rick Womick (R - Rockvale)
Representatives Dunn and Powers agreed to act as co-chairs of the campaign in Tennessee. Both men acknowledged that some additional colleagues are supporting Santorum in other ways. Dunn said that the Santorum campaign is surging at just the right time. "I've been for Rick Santorum from the beginning, and I am proud to stand with my fellow representatives in support of a man with such integrity and courage," Dunn said.
Powers said that he was also impressed with Santorum's Made in America Plan and his promise to repeal Obamacare. "Senator Santorum is a true conservative who believes that America's hope lies in her people, not in the government."
