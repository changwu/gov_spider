    The President is pleased with the progress that was made today in conference committee on the energy mobilization board (EMB). It now appears that a sound and workable bill will soon be on the President's desk.
The tentative conference committee agreement meets the criteria the President set forth for an effective EMB:
—Consolidated judicial review to prevent years of delay in duplicative court suits;
—"Streamlining" provisions to cut through procedural redtape;
—An effective "grandfather" provision to keep critical national energy projects from being brought to a standstill by changes in law and regulation adopted after construction begins.
The conference compromise also contains provisions authorizing substantive law changes through an expedited legislative procedure—for no more than 12 projects per Congress, under limited circumstances and after full review by appropriate congressional committees and the Congress as a whole. While the administration has consistently opposed bypassing the normal legislative process for substantive law changes and continues to hold that position, we believe that this procedure, which fully protects the right of congressional committees to approve proposed changes in substantive laws, comes so close to the normal legislative process that its inclusion should not be a reason for further delay in enacting a bill.
The President appreciates the effort of Senators Johnston, Jackson, and Domenici, together with Congressmen Dingell, Staggers, Brown, for their leadership on this important energy legislation.
