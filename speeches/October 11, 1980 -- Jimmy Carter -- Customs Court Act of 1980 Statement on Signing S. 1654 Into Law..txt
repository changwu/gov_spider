    I have signed into law, S. 1654, the Customs Court Act of 1980.
This legislation, which contains many of the provisions proposed by the administration, creates a comprehensive system for judicial review of civil actions arising out of import transactions and Federal statutes affecting international trade. The bill enhances the importance and effectiveness of the new Court of International Trade, formerly the Customs Court. I am pleased to have signed this major judicial reform bill into law.
Unfortunately the bill retains a political affiliation requirement which stipulates that no more than five of the nine members of the Court of International Trade can be from the same political party. This provision is inappropriate as applied to the present Customs Court. The appointment of judges to a court created under Article III of the Constitution should be on the basis of merit, not political affiliation.
I urge that the 97th Congress pass legislation deleting this unfortunate requirement.
