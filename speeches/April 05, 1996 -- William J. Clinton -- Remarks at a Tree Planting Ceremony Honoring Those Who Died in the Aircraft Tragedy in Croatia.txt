    Last year, as we prepared to go to Oklahoma City, Hillary and I planted a dogwood tree here in honor of the public servants who lost their lives there. And this year as we prepare to go back, almost a year later, we are planting, sadly, another tree in honor of Secretary Brown and all the public servants of the United States and the citizens who lost their lives in the plane crash. We hope the prayers of the American people will be with them and their families at this difficult time. We hope everyone will honor the contributions they made to the United States and the welfare of our people.
