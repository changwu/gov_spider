    On Labor Day, September 7th, Vice President Mike Pence will travel to La Crosse, Wisconsin. There, the Vice President will visit Dairyland Power Cooperative and deliver remarks thanking all of the hardworking Americans who make up the greatest labor force in the world. During President Trump and Vice President Pence's Administration, they have enacted pro-growth policies, which led to an unemployment rate of 3.1% in March and 59,600 Wisconsin jobs, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs since the President took office. Since the pandemic, over 200,000 Wisconsin jobs have been recovered and over 92% of Wisconsin small businesses have safely reopened. Later that evening, the Vice President will return to Washington, D.C.
Additional details about the Vice President's trip are forthcoming.
