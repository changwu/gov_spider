    I am delighted to send greetings to Jews in this country and around the world as you celebrate the festival of Hanukkah.
The Jewish religion is rich with tradition, and this special holiday is one of both teaching and joy. It commemorates the faith and the perseverance of Judah Maccabee and his followers, who were able to defeat their oppressors and rededicate the Temple in Jerusalem. According to tradition, even though the Maccabees could find enough purified oil in the Temple to keep the sacred menorah burning for only one night of celebration, the oil lasted for eight days and eight nights.
This story of abiding trust in the mercy and justice of the Almighty continues to be a source of inspiration to Jews around the world. The miracle of the Lights illustrates that the power of the Lord can overcome what seem to be impossible obstacles and that working together to achieve common objectives can make the world a brighter place for all.
Barbara and the entire Bush family join with me in sending our best wishes for a memorable Hanukkah.
