Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President Fiscal Discipline Policy Advisory Group. This group of men and women will be tasked with advising Governor Romney on strategies to cut government spending and reform government programs.
The Fiscal Discipline Policy Advisory Group will be chaired by Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC), a Senior Adviser to Governor Romney and a leading fiscal conservative in the United States Senate.
"Changing Washington begins with Republicans advocating fiscal discipline and smaller government. We need to take Washington apart and put it back together based on sound conservative, fiscally responsible principles," said Governor Romney. "The men and women of this group bring years of oversight and management experience that will help us find ways to cut the size of government and make it more efficient."
Governor Romney has outlined several initiatives to bring fiscal discipline back to Washington. In March 2007, Governor Romney proposed a strong agenda to restrain government spending. As President, he has pledged to veto non-defense discretionary appropriations bills that grow spending at a rate greater than inflation minus one percent (CPI-1%). This will save $300 billion over 10 years. Governor Romney will also review and reevaluate all federal spending programs to eliminate wasteful spending. He also supports giving the President the same line-item vetoing authority he used so many times as Governor of Massachusetts.
As Chair of the Fiscal Discipline Policy Advisory Group, Senator DeMint said, "Governor Romney has spoken forcefully for the need for change in Washington. That change begins with Republicans returning to the fundamental conservative principles of fiscal responsibility. Government should be smaller and the American people should be taxed less. Governor Romney is the right candidate to cut spending because he's already done it."
