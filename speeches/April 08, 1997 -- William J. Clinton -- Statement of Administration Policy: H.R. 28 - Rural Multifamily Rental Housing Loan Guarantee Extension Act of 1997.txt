    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Bereuter (R) NE)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 28, which would extend the Department of Agriculture's program of loan guarantees for multifamily rental housing in rural areas. The Administration will, however, work with the Senate to make improvements in the administration of this loan guarantee program.
