    NEW YORK â€“ Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Friday announced it raised more money in March than it did during its record-breaking February.
"What this campaign is doing is bringing together millions of people contributing an average of just $27 each to take on a billionaire class which is so used to buying elections," Sanders said. "Working people standing together are going to propel this campaign to the Democratic nomination and then the White House."
Sanders' grassroots campaign, which has now received 6.5 million contributions from 2 million donors, raised $44 million dollars in March, beating the $43.5 million it raised last month. The haul from March brings Sanders' total for the first quarter of 2016 to $109 million. More than 97 percent of the money was raised online.
