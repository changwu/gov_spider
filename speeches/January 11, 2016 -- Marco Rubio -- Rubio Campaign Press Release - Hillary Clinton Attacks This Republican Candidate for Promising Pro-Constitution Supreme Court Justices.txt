We know Hillary Clinton and Democrat elites are already afraid to run against Marco. 
Their latest line of attack: Marco respects the Constitution, life, and the family.
In a new op-ed, Hillary says the Supreme Court is at stake in 2016 — and she's right.

She's so far to the left that she attacks Marco for favoring justices who respect traditional values:
Marco Rubio says he wants "more Scalias" on the Court — justices who would rule against marriage equality and roll back a woman's right to choose.

There's no doubt: Marco has never been afraid to stand up for life.

He has never been afraid to stand up for the family.He has never been afraid to stand up for the Constitution.Nominating judges is one of the President's most important responsibilities, and Marco will pick ones who respect our most sacred institutions.
