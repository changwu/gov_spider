    THE NATION and the State of New Mexico need Andy Carter in the United States Senate and Pete Domenici in the statehouse. I am proud to give them my endorsement.
Andy Carter is a man who will stand with the national administration in Washington as we take our positions on the great issues of our time. He is a man who believes that the Nation must maintain a strong defense posture. He also takes a strong stand against lawlessness and violence at home. When Andy Carter becomes the junior Senator from the "Land of Enchantment," he will provide a fresh voice in Washington, a voice of which all New Mexicans will be proud.
Pete Domenici comes before the voters of New Mexico with a strong and specific platform, a positive program that will bring more jobs, better education, and greater safety to the people of this State. He is already a proven leader, a man with invaluable experience in local government. He is a man who will do more for New Mexico when he becomes your: Governor.
I regard both Andy Carter and Pete Domenici as good friends of the Nixon administration. They and all the Republican candidates in this State deserve your support on November 3d.
