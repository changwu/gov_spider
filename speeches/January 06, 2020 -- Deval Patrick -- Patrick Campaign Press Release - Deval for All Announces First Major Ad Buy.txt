    First ad, "Not Too Late," will air in the first four states, with significant buys in New Hampshire and South Carolina
BOSTON, MA - Today, Deval Patrick's campaign for president announced a six-figure television and digital ad buy across the four early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina -- with significant investments in both New Hampshire and South Carolina. The buy comes as the campaign has been growing it's staff nationwide and building momentum in New Hampshire and South Carolina.
"No other candidate has the life or leadership experience that Deval does," Campaign Manager Abe Rakov said. "We're thrilled to have the opportunity to share far and wide why Governor Patrick is the candidate with the record and message to defeat Trump and renew the American Dream."
Entitled "Not Too Late," the 30-second spot was shot in Boston and Governor Patrick's hometown, on the South Side of Chicago. The ad features his wife, Diane, who reflects on her battle with cancer and discusses their decision to get into the race. "Some people say it's too late for me to run for president. But growing up on the South Side of Chicago, people told me then what I could and couldn't do. I've been an underdog my whole life, and I've never let that stop me," says Governor Patrick in the ad.
The ads will begin airing immediately on television and digital platforms in the first four states. The buy is part of an effort to introduce the vast number of undecided voters in the early states to a candidate with a proven track record of delivering results for his constituents.
