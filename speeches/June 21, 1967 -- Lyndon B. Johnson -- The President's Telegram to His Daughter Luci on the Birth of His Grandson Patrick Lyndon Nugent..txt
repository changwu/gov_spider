    YOU handled this superbly as you do all things. I am so happy for you and Patrick, Senior, and Patrick Lyndon. Our best Hereford heifer is being curried for delivery to the Lewis-Nugent Ranch consigned to your nine-pound son, who incidentally I know doesn't look like a donkey and I hope his father will quit publicizing him as an elephant. The time has come to get the Republicanism out of all these Waukegan products.
Love,
Daddy
