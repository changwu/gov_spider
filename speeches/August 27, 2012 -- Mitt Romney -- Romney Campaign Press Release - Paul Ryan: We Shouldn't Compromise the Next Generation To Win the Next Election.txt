They are so worried about their election that they're compromising the country and the next generation. And so I decided back then I'm going to do what I think is right. I'm going to move this debate so we can get this country fixed, so we don't have the kind of European result that we're clearly heading toward."  –Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "To be good at these jobs, in leadership in Congress, serving as Vice President, you have to be willing to lose the job. Meaning you can't worry about your next election. You need to worry about the next generation about what needs to be done to save this country, and that's the problem I have with President Obama and a lot of politicians like him in Washington. They are so worried about their election that they're compromising the country and the next generation. And so I decided back then I'm going to do what I think is right. I'm going to move this debate so we can get this country fixed, so we don't have the kind of European result that we're clearly heading toward. And what I'm really pleased to see is we're finally having that adult conversation we need to have in this country if we want to fix this country's problems and get us back to prosperity and get people back to work."
