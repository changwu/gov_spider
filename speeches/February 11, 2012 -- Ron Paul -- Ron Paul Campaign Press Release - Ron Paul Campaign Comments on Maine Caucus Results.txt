LAKE JACKSON, Texas — Tonight the campaign of 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul sent an email to supporters regarding today's caucus results from the state of Maine. See below for a portion of comments from Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Manager John Tate.
"Ron Paul will win the most delegates out of Maine tonight.
"In fact, he will probably even win the 'beauty contest' straw poll the media has already called for Mitt Romney — even before all the votes have been tallied.
"In Washington County — where Ron Paul was incredibly strong — the caucus was delayed until next week just so the votes wouldn't be reported by the national media today.
"Of course, their excuse for the delay was 'snow.'
"That's right. A prediction of 3-4 inches — that turned into nothing more than a dusting — was enough for a local GOP official to postpone the caucuses just so the results wouldn't be reported tonight.
"This is MAINE we're talking about. The GIRL SCOUTS had an event today in Washington County that wasn't cancelled!
"And just the votes of Washington County would have been enough to put us over the top.
"This is an outrage. But our campaign is in this race to win, and will stay in it to the very end.
"Congressman Paul's message of liberty and Constitutional principles is resonating with Americans everywhere who are sick and tired of the status quo establishment, and we plan to take this campaign on to 'Super Tuesday' and beyond."
