    L'AQUILA, ITALY
Leaders from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United Kingdom met on July 8, 2009 to demonstrate their determination to ensure sustainable growth, and to tackle the interlinked challenges of the economic crisis, trade, climate change, and development.
In their declarations, Leaders:
•      Affirmed their commitments to take all necessary steps to support global demand, restore economic growth, maintain financial stability, and preserve open markets worldwide.
•      Reconfirmed their commitment to reject protectionist policies and to keep markets open, and committed to reach a balanced and comprehensive conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda.
•      Pledged to confront climate change, and committed to seek an ambitious global agreement in Copenhagen. They recognized the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels should not exceed 2° C. They agreed to join a global response to achieve a 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050, and to a goal of an aggregate 80 percent or more reduction by developed countries by that date. They called upon major emerging economies to undertake quantifiable actions to collectively reduce emissions significantly below business-as-usual by a specified year.
•      Committed to assist developing countries in coping with the impact of the global economic crisis. They pledged to support the Global Partnership for Agricultural and Food Security, a program of multilateral support for food security. They also reiterated their commitment to support countries' efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
•      Agreed to enhanced accountability by releasing the first G8 report on the implementation of past commitments regarding all ongoing development initiatives. That report, with individual and collective data, is being released today and details progress in the areas of food security, the water action plan, global health, and education.
Over the next two days, Leaders from the G8 will be joined by Leaders from a number of other countries, will take up many of these subjects, and will seek to broaden the commitment by all to these efforts and initiatives.
