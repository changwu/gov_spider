    Memorandum for Honorable Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defense; Honorable Ramsey Clark, The Attorney General
I know that all Americans share my pride in the men in uniform and the civilian law enforcement personnel for their outstanding service in the Nation's Capital during the last two days.
Their mission was trying and difficult. They performed it with restraint, firmness and professional skill. Their actions stand in sharp contrast to the irresponsible acts of violence and lawlessness by many of the demonstrators.
They return to their regular posts of duty with the respect and appreciation of their President and their Nation.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
