    Generalissimo Franco, Mrs. Franco, friends of Spain and of the United States:
I begin my visit in Spain with very real satisfaction that comes from renewing and underlining the traditional relationship and friendship between our two countries.
My last visit to Spain was at a time of mourning in the closing days of 1973. Today is a happier occasion. I look forward with keen interest to our discussions.
This is a time of rapid change and challenge worldwide. We shall respond to these new challenges, as we must, both individually and collectively. I have confidence in our proven ability to work together in the pursuit of common interests, and I have confidence in Spain--a nation with future of great promise.
The dignity, the pride, the resilience of the Spanish people have been forged over a history much longer than that of the United States. Spain has contributed much to the history and to the culture of the United States. Today, millions and millions of Americans speak the Spanish language.
My visit to Spain is, above all, a recognition of Spain's significance as a friend and as a partner. Our excellent relationship is confirmed in the 1974 Joint Declaration of Principles. Our peoples seek the same objectives of peace, progress, and freedom.
By geography and by history, Spain has a logical place in the transatlantic community. For more than 20 years, Spain has shared with America and with Europe the burdens of promoting the prosperity and the security of the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions. Spain can be proud of that contribution.
Generalissimo Franco, Your Excellencies, friends, it is my privilege to bring to you the greetings of the people of the United States. Our two countries look forward to a future of expanding cooperation. I know that we will meet the challenges and the changes that lie ahead.
Thank you.
