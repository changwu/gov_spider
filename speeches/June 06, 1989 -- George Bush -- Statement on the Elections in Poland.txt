    Sunday's elections in Poland marked an important step toward freedom and democracy. I am encouraged by the responses of both the Polish Government and members of the opposition to the election results. I hope the movement toward political pluralism will continue to follow the responsible, constructive path it has taken since the historic roundtable agreements in April.
As I said in my speech in Hamtramck, Michigan, April 17, the Polish people are now taking steps that deserve our active support. We will work in concert with our allies to help Polish democracy take root anew and sustain itself. The Polish people face a difficult task ahead, but their first steps have been firmly in the right direction.
