    Mitt Romney today announced the support of the members of the Douglas County Colorado Board of Education.
"I'm truly grateful to earn the support of the members of the Douglas County Board of Education for my education reform agenda," said Mitt Romney. "They share my vision of taking control of our children's curriculum out of the hands of the federal government. Our kids are served best when these crucial decisions are made at the local level."
Announcing his support, Douglas County School District Board of Education President John Carson said, "We are very proud to be supporting Mitt Romney. He is committed to making our education system more effective by reducing needless federal intrusion, empowering local officials, and promoting choice and competition. He is also a proven leader who has shown time and again that he can turn around troubled enterprises. That is exactly what the bureaucratic U.S. Department of Education needs today. I look forward to having a President Romney in the White House and unleashing our schools and our students to achieve their full potential."
Members of the Douglas County Board of Education:
John Carson — President
Dan Gerken — Vice President
