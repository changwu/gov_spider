Iran leadership doesn't understand the words 'nice' or 'compassion' they never have. Sadly the thing they do understand is Strength and Power and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone..Retweets: 24975Favorites: 112835

....The wonderful Iranian people are suffering and for no reason at all. Their leadership spends all of its money on Terror and little on anything else. The U.S. has not forgotten Iran's use of IED's & EFP's (bombs) which killed 2000 Americans and wounded many more...Retweets: 17183Favorites: 78756

....Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!Retweets: 24639Favorites: 99441
