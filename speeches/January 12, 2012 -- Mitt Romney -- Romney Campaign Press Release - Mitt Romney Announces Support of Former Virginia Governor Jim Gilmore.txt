    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore.
"I'm extraordinarily honored to earn Jim's support," said Mitt Romney. "Jim has been a longtime voice for spreading conservative values to grow the economy such as cutting taxes, lowering spending and making government more efficient. As an Army veteran, he also understands the need for America to project strength in the world. I look forward to working with Jim, in the months to come, to spread my message of 'Simpler, Smaller, and Smarter' federal government."
"Conservatives not only need a candidate who can beat President Obama, but one who can also put our values into action," said former Governor Jim Gilmore. "That candidate is Mitt Romney. No other candidate in the race has a more detailed plan to get Americans back to work or has a laid out a vision for America's role in the world. Our country cannot take four more years of President Obama's failed fiscal and economic policies. Mitt Romney will bring America back and I'm proud to stand with him."
