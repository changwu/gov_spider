    BATON ROUGE â€“ Following Governor Jindal's strong performance during last night's debate, here is what they are saying are about his strategy and its impact:
Erick Erickson: Again, Bobby Jindal Won the First Debate
This guy really deserves to be on the main stage. He had another commanding performance while Santorum embarrassed himself. Christie, welcomed to the kid's table, had to deal with a Jindal who is clearly not a fan of Christie's and Jindal got the better of him.
Politico: Jindal goes after Christie as a 'big-government Republican'
Bobby Jindal went on the attack against Chris Christie, going after the New Jersey governor's record on economic issues, dinging him as a "big-government Republican."
Records matter, Jindal said, as does the way governors govern. The Louisiana governor pointed to credit upgrades and budget decreases in Louisiana and credit downgrades and budget increases in New Jersey.

Jindal later sprung a trap for Christie, arguing he had failed to sufficiently trim his state's budget.
"Let's not just beat Hillary, let's elect a conservative to the White House, not just any Republican," Jindal said, arguing that the GOP shouldn't be "a second liberal party."
Washington Examiner: Bobby Jindal hijacks debate with fight over direction of GOP
More than a few observers felt Jindal had pushed too hard. But one experienced GOP hand, Alex Castellanos, saw a deliberate strategy in Jindal's approach. "Turns out all @BobbyJindal needed to get big was a big opponent," Castellanos, who is not affiliated with any campaign, said. "Thank you @GovChristie. Best day of Jindal campaign yet."
The Hill: Jindal attacks Huckabee over economy

two winners of undercard: @BobbyJindal spoke to IA and won. @GovChristie spoke to NH and won. good evening for both men. #GOPDebate

As the undercard winds up, conservatives will probably crown Jindal the winner. Christie also strong #GOPDebate #voaalert
David M. Drucker @DavidMDrucker
Give this to @BobbyJindal - #GOPDebate would be a snoozer w/out him.

This Jindal-Christie spat is actually substantive and worthy of having.
Ryan Struyk @ryanstruyk
Jindal isn't afraid to take the gloves off here. Attacking Christie and Huckabee on their records, has very specific facts down.
Alexis Levinson @alexis_levinson
Jindal is on tonight.
