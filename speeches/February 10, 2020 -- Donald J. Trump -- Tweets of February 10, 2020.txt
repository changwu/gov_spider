Will be in Manchester, New Hampshire, tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results, votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!Retweets: 21447Favorites: 93774

95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!Retweets: 30969Favorites: 151219

Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax, AOC will primary Cryin' Chuck Schumer, and win, and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House, AGAIN! My poll numbers great.Retweets: 27038Favorites: 126054

Hope the Fake News, which never discusses it, is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won't!Retweets: 25687Favorites: 127031

Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. "Trump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28%, up 10 points in a year. Nice one, Nancy."Retweets: 16994Favorites: 71620
