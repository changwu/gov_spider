    Senator Dorgan should be very proud of his more than 30 years of devoted service in the United States Congress and to the people of North Dakota. From fighting for our energy future to standing with North Dakota's families through difficult economic times, Senator Dorgan has been a trusted leader for the people of his State. He has also been a champion for our family farmers and a powerful voice for Indian Country, particularly through his recent work to improve Indian health care services.
Michelle and I extend our gratitude for his service to our Nation and our very best wishes for the future for him and his family.
