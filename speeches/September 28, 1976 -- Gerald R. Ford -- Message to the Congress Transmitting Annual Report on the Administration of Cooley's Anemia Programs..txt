    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the Fourth Annual Report on the Administration of the Cooley's Anemia Programs in accordance with the requirements of Section 1115 of the Public Health Service Act before it was amended by P.L. 94-278.
The Report describes the activities of the Health Services Administration (HSA), the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in implementing the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the National Cooley's Anemia Control Act. Screening, counseling, and education activities are underway to provide such services to the public through ongoing genetic blood diseases programs. Efforts are continuing to improve laboratory methods for the detection of Cooley's anemia and expanded training programs for health personnel are improving the capability for such detection. Research in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Cooley's anemia is progressing with continued high priority being given to the development and evaluation of more effective ways to reduce the iron load in the bodies of patients that has resulted from repeated blood transfusions required to maintain life.
