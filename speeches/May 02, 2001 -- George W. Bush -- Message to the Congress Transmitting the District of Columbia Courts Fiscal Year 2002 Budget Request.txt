    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Courts FY 2002 Budget Submission.
The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2002 budget request for $111.7 million for operating expenses, $41.4 million for capital improvements to courthouse facilities, and $39.7 million for Defender Services in the District of Columbia Courts. My FY 2002 budget includes recommended funding levels of $105.2 million for operations, $6.0 million for capital improvements, and $34.3 million for Defender Services. My transmittal of the District of Columbia Courts' budget request does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 2002 appropriations process.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, May 2, 2001.
