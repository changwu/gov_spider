HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado endorsed Ted Cruz for President. Buck will also serve as the Cruz Campaign's Colorado State Chairman. Buck previously served as the Chief of the Criminal Division in the Colorado U.S. Attorney's Office and was elected three times as District Attorney for Weld County. He serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
"We need a strong, conservative leader in the White House," said Buck. "Ted Cruz is that leader. He has consistently and passionately fought hard against the Washington establishment in order to restore the power back to the American people. We need Ted in 2016 in order to help restore America back to the principles that made this country exceptional."
"Ken has been a champion for conservative principles during his time in Congress," said Cruz. "He has stood up and fought against Obama's lawlessness, worked to protect life and marriage and to repeal Obamacare. Ken is a tireless leader and has served the people of Colorado well. I am thrilled to have his support and look forward to working together to bring conservatives together to win the White House in 2016."
