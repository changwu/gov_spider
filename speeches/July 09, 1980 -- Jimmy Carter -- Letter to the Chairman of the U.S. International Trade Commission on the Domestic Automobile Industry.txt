    To Chairman Alberger
You are now beginning an investigation under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to determine whether domestic producers of passenger cars, light trucks, vans, and general utility vehicles are being seriously injured, or threatened with serious injury, substantially caused by increased imports.
Given the widespread attention in this country to recent developments in the automotive sector, this investigation (TA 201-44) has become a matter of great national and international importance. I urge you to conduct your work as expeditiously as is practicable (pursuant to Section 201 (d) (2)), so that all of those involved will not be burdened for a period of 6 to 8 months with the uncertainty such a case creates. This case touches so many businesses, workers, and consumers in this country that an investigation of normal length could cause major uncertainties which could significantly affect automobile trade and production. At the same time, of course, it is critical that all parties have a full opportunity to be heard and to submit information and arguments that must be considered in your deliberations.
The Commission faces a challenging task and carries a great responsibility in this investigation. I recognize that your current workload is substantial, but I would deeply appreciate your efforts to accelerate your schedule on this important case.
My Administration stands ready to assist the Commission in whatever manner you feel would be appropriate.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Bill Alberger, Chairman, U.S. International Trade Commission, Suite 274, 701 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20436]
