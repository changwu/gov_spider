    WINTHROP ROCKEFELLER was a man of many dimensions. A successful businessman--the son of a great American family--he also knew from personal experience the life of hard manual labor. He was a leading force in the struggle for racial justice, and he contributed significantly not only to the preservation of our cultural heritage, but also brought new thinking to bear on numerous domestic problems.
Winthrop Rockefeller gave greatly to the people of his adopted State, Arkansas, and they returned his devotion with political honor and personal affection. He gave, as well, to this Nation through his quiet philanthropy, his public leadership, and his enterprising sense of adventure in making America a better country.
Mrs. Nixon and I join with all Americans in mourning the passing of a friend.
