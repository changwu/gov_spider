    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders Thursday welcomed the endorsement of Democracy for America, which is one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the country. Sanders won an unprecedented 87 percent of the 270,000 votes cast online from Dec. 7 through Tuesday.
"I'm proud to have DFA and its one-million members join our people powered campaign," Sanders said. "DFA's tireless focus on bringing people together through grassroots organizing is the best way we can fight back against the billionaires and oligarchs who have rigged our economy. I also want to congratulate DFA for its principled support for grassroots democracy and for its internal democratic process. It is no secret that the founder of DFA— my friend and fellow Vermonter former Gov. Howard Dean— has chosen not to support my candidacy. Yet the leadership of DFA allowed a fair and free vote to take place which we won. That's pretty impressive."
"Bernie Sanders is an unyielding populist progressive who decisively won Democracy for America members' first presidential primary endorsement because of his lifelong commitment to taking on income inequality and the wealthy and powerful interests who are responsible for it," DFA Executive Director Charles Chamberlain said. "Throughout his campaign, Bernie has repeatedly said that the huge problems of income inequality, money in politics, and structural racism that our country must confront are bigger than a single campaign – they need a political revolution.
"With today's endorsement, DFA members are joining Bernie's 'political revolution' and working to take it both to the White House and up-and-down the ballot, in races coast to coast," Chamberlain said.
DFA's endorsement comes the same day the Communications Workers of America, a union with 700,000 members, endorsed Sanders for president.
