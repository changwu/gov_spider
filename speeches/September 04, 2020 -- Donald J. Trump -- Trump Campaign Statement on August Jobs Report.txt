    "While Joe Biden continues to root for bad news, the economy maintained its rapid recovery as more and more Americans are returning to work. For the fourth consecutive month, the American economy has added a massive number of jobs in the greatest period of job growth in history. The 1.4 million jobs added in August are 2.5 times the number of jobs created in any single month of the entire Obama-Biden Administration, driving the unemployment rate down again. In just four months, more than 10.6 million jobs – nearly half of the jobs lost to the pandemic – have already been recovered. While the work is not finished, President Trump's policies positioned us to fight through the coronavirus crisis and reopen faster than doomsayers like Biden predicted. Biden says he would shut down the economy again, despite obvious evidence that we can be safe and get back to work at the same time. Biden would cripple the recovery by raising taxes by at least $4 trillion on more than 80 percent of taxpayers and impose the job-killing Green New Deal on every person, business, and building in the country. He would award work permits to illegal aliens and introduce more competition to Americans trying to get back on their feet. While Biden hopes for economic ruin to buoy his political fortunes, President Trump is leading the nation, working every day to Make America Great Again again."
