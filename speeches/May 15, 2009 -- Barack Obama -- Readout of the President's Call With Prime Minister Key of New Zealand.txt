    The President spoke on May 13 with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. New Zealand is an important partner of the United States on a range of international political and economic issues, and the two welcomed the opportunity to have their first phone conversation since their election to office last November. The President and Prime Minister discussed their respective responses to the global economic crisis, how they are dealing with its domestic and international impact, and the importance of trade in the Asia-Pacific region. The President expressed his appreciation for New Zealand's strong support to the allied effort in Afghanistan. They also discussed how our two countries can cooperate further on global and regional issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and work more closely together at the United Nations, in particular on human rights.
