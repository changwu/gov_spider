    U.S. Representative John R. Kasich (R-Westerville) is endorsing Senator Bob Dole's candidacy for the office of President of the United States. As chairman of the House Budget Committee John Kasich has worked closely with Senator Dole to out taxes and balance the budget.
"Bob Dole has the qualities needed to not only win the election this fall, but also to lead our country into the 21st century,"said Kasich. "He's a good candidate; he will be a great President."
He added, "Both Buchanan, Forbes and their respective followers have done a service by raising issues that deserve discussion during the campaign. But Bob Dole is the candidate best suited for uniting Republicans-- as well as like-minded independents and Democrats-- so we can recapture the White House in November."
"I'm delighted to have the support of my good friend John Kasich," said Senator Dole. He believes as I do, that with the right leader in the White House, America's brightest days are still to come. My mandate as President will be to rein in the federal government, set free the spirit of the American people, and reconnect Washington to the common sense values of the American people."
