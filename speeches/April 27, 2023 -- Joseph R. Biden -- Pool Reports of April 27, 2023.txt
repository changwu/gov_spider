In-town pool #1
Good morning from the White House, where there is a mock press briefing happening for the children of news and other staff as part of Bring Your Child to Work Day.
It's 60 degrees and sunny. The president also will participate in a Bring Your Child to Work Day event around 12:15p that is open press. That's followed by a briefing with the press secretary at 1:45p and a virtual meeting between the president and grassroots supporters around 6:45p.
Reach out with any questions.

The pool is waiting for the president on the south lawn. The event, pegged to Take Your Child to Work Day, will be live-steamed. The children in attendance all appear very patient.

In-town pool #3
POTUS emerged around 12:42 p.m. after an introduction from a child. He said one of the things he misses the most is being able to bring his young children to work with him, and still has pictures hanging up from those days.
The appearance was for Take Your Child to Work Day.
Biden took questions from the children in attendance, including what it's like being president. He spoke about his children and grandchildren, trying to recall where each of the six now live. He spoke about his biggest inspirations, his mother and father, and about some of his legislative accomplishments. One kid asked him how many guards there are in the White House. "I don't know, honey, there's a lot," Biden concluded. There was a lot of interest about life in the White House. He invited another to go inside, but they turned down his invitation.
His favorite rose? White, Biden said, cause it's the one he gives to his wife. The last country he traveled to? …. POTUS paused and didn't give an answer. After a few seconds, one of the kids shouted "Ireland." "You're right! How'd you know that?" an impressed Biden asked.
He took a few more qs — seemingly more than he's taken from the (adult) White House press corps in some time. He said his favorite movie —this year—is "Top Gun." Another kid came to the mic and reminded Biden he had to go back to the Oval Office. He thanked the audience, many of them administration staffers with badges who had been here since late morning.
He wrapped at 1:06 p.m.
