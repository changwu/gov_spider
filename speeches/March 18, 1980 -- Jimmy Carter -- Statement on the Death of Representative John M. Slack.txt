    Rosalynn and I were saddened to learn today of the death of Congressman John Slack.
Throughout West Virginia he will long be remembered as a Congressman who helped the people of his Third District to solve their problems and represented them well in Washington.
Those who knew him in his long career in the U.S. House of Representatives will best remember his dedication, integrity, and sense of honor.
We wish to extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Frances, his son, John, his grandchildren, and his brother, William.
