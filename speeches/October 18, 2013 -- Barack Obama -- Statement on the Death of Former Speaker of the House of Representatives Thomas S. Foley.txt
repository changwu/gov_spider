    Today America has lost a legend of the United States Congress. For 30 years, Tom Foley represented the people of Washington's Fifth District with skill, dedication, and a deep commitment to improving the lives of those he was elected to serve. Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties, eventually leading to his election as the 57th Speaker of the House. After his career in Congress, Tom served as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, where his poise and civility helped strengthen our relationship with one of our closest allies. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Tom's wife Heather and the entire Foley family.
