    The First Lady. Welcome to the Easter Egg Roll.
As your First Lady and as a teacher, I've seen again and again: Learning doesn't only happen in a classroom. There are so many fun opportunities to learn around us every day. And that's what we—why we wanted to celebrate our Easter Egg Roll.
So we turned to—the South Lawn into a school community. What brings it to life is all of you: your laughter, your joy, the art you create, and the memories you take home with you. That is what makes this event so special.
So today we hope you learn, explore, and grow by listening to a story in the reading nook, rolling some eggs, playing with circuit boards, or building robots, and most of all, having fun.
Welcome to your house, the White House. Happy Easter.
Now please welcome my husband, our President, Joe Biden.
The President. Good morning, everyone. I'm Joe Biden, Jill's husband. [Laughter] And welcome to the White House, your house. And special thanks to the Egg Board and the American egg farmers, the White House Historical Association, the National Park Service, and all the talented performers for making this day possible.
And thanks to all the children and families for being part of such a special White House tradition. It's been going on for a long time.
I hope you had a wonderful Easter weekend. Easter is a season of joy, a time of rebirth, renewal, faith, hope, and love; a time to remember that in the beauty of spring, the seeds of new opportunity are planted. And this spring, our future fills—is filled with unlimited possibilities that can multiply and grow because of all the good people here and throughout the country.
Ladies and gentlemen, what I see, looking across the South Lawn, is a country made up of possibilities. Anything's possible in America if we remember who we are and we do it together.
So have a wonderful, wonderful time here at the "people's house." God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Happy Easter.
