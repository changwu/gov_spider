    THE SKYLAB flight that begins today marks 'the conclusion of the single most productive program in the history of man's quest for knowledge about himself and his world. The crew of Skylab will mark in space the 16th anniversary of America's first step toward the heavens. From the launch of a 30-pound space satellite, we progressed to the exploration of the Moon, which is helping to determine Earth's place in the universe. Now we are moving to determine through space technology man's own place in the universe, and to greater understanding of our own planet.
As we are grateful for the success of our previous ventures into space, and as we look to the success of that which is imminent, let us never take for granted the skill and courage and devotion of those who labor on behalf of the United States space program. Let us rather pause to reflect with pride upon what we have done, asking God's blessings upon our efforts, and God's grace upon those who bravely place their lives at the service of peace for all mankind.
