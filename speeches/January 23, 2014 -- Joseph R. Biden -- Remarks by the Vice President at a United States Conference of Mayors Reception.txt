    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, welcome to the White House. My name is Joe Biden. I work for President Obama. (Laughter.) Best job I ever had.
Hey, folks, look, there's a reason the President and I like talking to mayors. You're the one group of elected officials that get things done, in large part because you have no option but to get things done. (Laughter.) And also, most of the innovation is coming from you all.
Today, I got further evidence of that when I talked with a few of you about what we can do together on the jobs, skills and workforce development. We promised, back in 2009, there would be -- we'd be a strong partner with you, and I'm confident in saying that because of the man I'm about to introduce, we've kept that promise.
President Obama understands cities better than most American presidents have in American history. He knows cities face unique challenges when it comes to building infrastructure and creating jobs, and that's why he nominated a big city mayor, Anthony Foxx -- he doesn't have all the money in the world, but he's ready to help.
And also, I've gotten a chance to work directly with so many of you during the Recovery Act. The only reason it worked, the only reason there was less than 1 percent waste or fraud -- including with our Republican friends who investigated -- is because of you. You made it work. You're used to getting things done on time -- mostly under budget -- and getting answers back to people immediately. And it never ceases to amaze me the tough political decisions, you guys and women, you make every single day in doing your job -- to save your neighborhoods, to rebuild and balance your budgets, and to bring jobs back to your communities.
So I'm honored to have you here, we're honored to have you here. And I'm really honored to introduce the best friend the cities have ever had in this White House, President Barack Obama. (Applause.)
