    A new poll from Quinnipiac shows widespread support for the American Rescue Plan: nearly 7 in 10 Americans support the plan, including nearly 7 in 10 Independents. This poll comes on the heels of findings three other recent polls from Monmouth and Yahoo/YouGov both showing broad support for the President's plan. The recent Monmouth Poll showed that 71% of Americans would prefer Republicans in Congress find ways to work with Biden and Yahoo/YouGov showed that the President's plan has garnered bipartisan support among the American people: more than two-thirds of Americans support core elements of the American Rescue Plan, including direct payments (74%), funding for vaccines (69%), a minimum wage increase (58%).
Bipartisan mayors and local elected officials support President Biden's plan too. 411 bipartisan mayors sent a letter to Congressional leadership urging immediate action on the plan. The National Association of County Officials, US Conference of Mayors, and National League of Cities have all recently praised the American Rescue Plan. And the top economic advisors from the last four presidents: Kevin Hassett, , Gene Sperling, R. Glenn Hubbard, and Alan Blinder endorsed the plan and agreed that the cost of doing too little is greater than doing too much.
