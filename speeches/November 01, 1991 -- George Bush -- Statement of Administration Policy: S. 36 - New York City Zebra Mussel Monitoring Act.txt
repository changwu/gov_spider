    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/6/91)(Senate)(Moynihan (D) New York)
S. 36 would needlessly duplicate the authorities of P.L. 101-646, which was enacted late last year to prevent and control the infestation of U.S. coastal inland waters by the zebra mussel and other species. The Administration, therefore, opposes Senate passage of S. 36.
