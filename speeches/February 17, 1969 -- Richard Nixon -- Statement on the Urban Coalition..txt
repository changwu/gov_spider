    THE URBAN AFFAIRS COUNCIL has just had a most productive discussion with Mr. John Gardner of the Urban Coalition. This organization represents the kind of citizen volunteer effort that will help to reinvigorate our cities and our Nation. Its 42 local coalitions reflect the best in grass roots leadership.
In the Coalition, business, labor, local government, minority groups, and religious leaders work together to repair the grave gaps in communication that have fragmented our cities. These are American citizens who care about their own communities. They seek to end divisiveness and to bind together the conflicting forces within the community and the Nation.
The Urban Coalition is a "bring-us-together" organization, and I congratulate the leaders in American life who have made the Coalition such an effective instrument of citizen volunteer action--men such as Mr. Gardner, Andrew Heiskell, A. Philip Randolph, George Meany, Whitney Young, John Lindsay, and Arthur Flemming.
I urge business leadership throughout the Nation to lend active support to the Urban Coalition, both locally and nationally.
