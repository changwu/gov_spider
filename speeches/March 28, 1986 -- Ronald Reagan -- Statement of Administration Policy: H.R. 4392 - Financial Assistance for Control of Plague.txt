    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Richardson (D) New Mexico)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 4392, because it would establish yet another new, narrow categorical grant program for the control of plague. H.R. 4392 would duplicate the current funding of $88 million in Federal payments for preventive health efforts which could be used by States for the same purpose. H.R. 4392 is unnecessary and particularly inappropriate at a time when budget restraint is urgently needed.
