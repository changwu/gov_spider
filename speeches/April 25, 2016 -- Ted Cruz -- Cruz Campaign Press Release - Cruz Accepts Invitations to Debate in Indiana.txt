    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, the Cruz for President campaign accepted two invitations to participate in GOP debates in Indianapolis this week: one from WRTV and another from Tony Katz of WIBC radio.
"Today marks forty-six days since the last Republican debate," said Cruz. "Forty-six days. A month and a half. The Democrats have debated. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have showed the respect the voters are due by subjecting themselves to the scrutiny of the voters. Indeed, the Democrats are talking about scheduling a second debate, and yet Donald Trump continues to cower in Trump Tower, afraid to defend his positions. The reason he's been afraid to do so is he has no answer when he's asked how to bring jobs back to America. He has no answer when he's asked how to keep America safe from radical Islamic terrorism. This is a serious time. The American people want and deserve a serious leader focused on jobs, freedom, and security. That's exactly what I will be and what I will do as President."
