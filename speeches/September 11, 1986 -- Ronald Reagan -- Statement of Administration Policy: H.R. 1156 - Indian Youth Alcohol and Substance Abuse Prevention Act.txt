    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bereuter (R) NE and 4 others)
The Administration is deeply concerned about and shares the goal of decreasing alcoholism and drug abuse among American Indians and Alaska natives. However, the Administration opposes H.R. 1156 because it is unnecessary in view of existing improved and coordinated Federal efforts and because it calls for activities at the national level which can more effectively and economically be carried out at the local level.
