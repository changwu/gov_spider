    WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Senior Advisor to the Treasury Secretary Ron Bloom joined other top Administration officials, community leaders, clean energy investors and innovators at a Clean Energy Economy Forum.
Administration officials participated in a constructive dialogue with the attendees on opportunities to advance the development and commercialization of new clean energy technologies and strategies to support the creation and growth of emerging clean energy industries and enterprises. The group also discussed efforts to train workers for and promote exports which will help America transition to a clean energy economy and enhance our competitiveness.
"Clean energy is key to revitalizing an American industrial and manufacturing base that once supported the most prosperous middle class in history," Secretary Locke said. "And it can create exactly the types of high-skill, high-wage jobs that we need more of in America. With the right vision and the right commitment, we can build a clean energy economy that provides good jobs and sets America and the world up for decades of sustainable economic growth."
"Clean energy technology will help us use less and produce better quality energy while putting Americans back to work in good-paying, stable jobs," Bloom said.
Top Obama Administration officials have held more than a dozen similar forums at the White House and around the country to discuss our growing clean energy economy, including regional Clean Energy economy forums in Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State.
