    President Bush will welcome NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson for a meeting on October 10, 2001. Under Lord Robertson's leadership, NATO has declared the September 11 attacks on the United States as an attack against all NATO Allies, and has staunchly supported the United States in the campaign against international terrorism. This visit is a further important step in President Bush's efforts to ensure a strong and effective international coalition in the war against terrorism.
