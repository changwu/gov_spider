    I am pleased that the United Auto Workers and General Motors have resolved their differences today. Getting GM back to work is a win-win solutionâ€”a victory for the company and its employees and a victory for all Americans. It also shows that the collective bargaining process works. American companies can remain competitive in the world economy while providing good jobs and good benefits for their employees.
I would like to thank Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, who worked night and day behind the scenes to keep both parties working toward a resolution. She and her team deserve a great deal of credit for their patience and determination in the effort to help bring this dispute to a close.
