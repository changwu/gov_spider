    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives Glenn Richardson will serve as the campaign's Georgia Chairman. The campaign also unveiled endorsements from a host of Georgia elected and former Republican party officials in the first round of announcements for the Mayor's Georgia leadership team.
"Rudy has demonstrated the kind of strong leadership we need in the White House and has a record of proven results that Georgians respect. I look forward to promoting the Mayor's positive vision for the country across the state," Richardson said.
"I'm honored to have someone of Speaker Richardson's stature leading our efforts in Georgia and proud of the team we're assembling," Mayor Giuliani said.
In 1996, Glenn Richardson became the first Republican from Paulding County elected to the Georgia House of Representatives since Reconstruction. After serving as House Floor Leader and House Majority Leader, Richardson became Speaker of the State House in 2005. Richardson is the first Republican to serve as Georgia House Speaker in over 130 years.
Richardson was named legislator of the year in 2003 by the Republican Party of Georgia and has received numerous awards for his involvement in civic organizations, including the 2003 American Cancer Society Capitol Dome Award. In 2006, Speaker Richardson became chairman of the Southern Legislative Conference (SLC) and the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee (RLCC).
