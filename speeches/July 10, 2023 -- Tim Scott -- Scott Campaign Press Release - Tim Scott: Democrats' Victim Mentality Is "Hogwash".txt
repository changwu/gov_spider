John Roberts: So one of the hallmarks of your campaign is that you're taking on the Democrats' victim mentality, head on, but there are a lot of people on the left who say that this idea of up from the bootstraps, which you promote, that everybody could do it if they work hard enough, really is ignoring the basic racial history of this country. What do you say to those criticisms?
Sen Scott: Just one word: hogwash. It's the simplest word I can use. It's just hogwash. The truth of my life disproves the lies of the radical Left. What they hate the most is a candidate like me who actually disrupts their narrative. I'm a kid that grew up in a single parent household, mired in poverty, and because of American exceptionalism, good people, teachers, Chick-fil-A owners, came together to help me understand that if I took individual responsibility for myself, amazing things could happen. But here's the good news. It's not just my life. There are millions upon millions of Americans who started on one side of the tracks and they're now on the other side of the tracks. The great news of America's future is that it's not the color of your skin, it's the quality of your education. And that's one of the reasons why as president of the United States, I will encourage every state to embrace and adopt school choice programs and then take the two major buckets of money from the federal government, Title I and Title II, and send them with the kid. Wherever the kid goes, the dollars should follow. We can change the future of this country. And it starts with our education system. It's time for the GOP, the Great Opportunity Party, to be serious about education.
