Boston, MA - Romney for President today launched its newest television ad, "Secure Borders." The ad highlights Governor Romney's support for reforming our immigration system by strengthening our borders and implementing an employment verification system. The remarks were made at an "Ask Mitt Anything" forum on April 3 in Derry, New Hampshire.
The ad will be a part of the campaign's spot rotation starting this weekend in markets in Iowa and New Hampshire. Scripts and viewing links are below.
Script For "Secure Borders" (TV:60):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "Yes Sir?"
QUESTIONER: "How would you deal with the border issue?"
GOVERNOR ROMNEY: "Number one, we should secure our border.
"And number two, we should put in place an employment verification system.
"And by that, I mean that everybody who is not a United States citizen, with a valid Social Security number, would be expected to get a card, with their name and their number and some biometric information. And would indicate their work status, whether they have a visa that allows them to work here or not.
"And then when an employer is thinking of hiring someone, if they don't have a valid Social Security number, he asks for the card, or she asks for the card. They input the number into the computer. The federal database immediately tells them whether they're available to be working or not.
"If they're not, you can't hire them. And if you do, you get the same penalties and fines as if you're not paying your taxes.
"Legal immigration is great. But illegal immigration, that we've got to end. Thank you. And amnesty is not the way to do it. Thanks so much, thank you.
"I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message."
