    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting, for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification, the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the German Democratic Republic signed at Berlin on September 4, 1979. I am also transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The signing of this Convention is a significant step in the process of improving and broadening the relationship between the United States and the German Democratic Republic. Consular relations between the two countries are not now the subject of a modern formal agreement. This Convention will establish firm obligations on such important matters as free communication between a citizen and his consul, notification of consular officers of the arrest and detention of their nationals, and permission for visits by consuls to nationals who are under detention.
I also transmit for the information of the Senate a separate exchange of letters, signed on September 4, 1979, setting forth the understanding of each side that consular officers of the sending State have the right of access under Article 39 of the Convention to persons who are citizens of the sending State. It is a generally accepted principle of international law that each State has the sovereign right to determine acquisition, maintenance and loss of its citizenship.
I welcome the opportunity through this Consular Convention to improve the relations between the two countries and their nationals. I urge the Senate to give the Convention its prompt and favorable consideration.
