    Thank you to the families who joined us at the White House today in honor of our Nation's fallen heroes. The American people grieve alongside all the families who have lost loved ones in service to our country. Our Administration fully supports our military men and women, as they are the protectors of our freedom. We continue to pray for all those currently deployed. To our Gold Star families everywhere â€“ the husbands and wives, the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, and the daughters and sons, we remain indebted to the selfless sacrifices made by these heroes. Thank you to all those who have served or are currently serving in our Armed Forces. May God bless you, your families, and may God bless the United States of America.
