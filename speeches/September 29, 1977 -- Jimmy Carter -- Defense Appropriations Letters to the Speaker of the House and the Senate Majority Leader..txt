    Dear Mr. Speaker:
Unless the Congress acts soon, over onehalf billion dollars will be wasted on unneeded defense purchases.
In acting on 1978 appropriations for Defense, the Congress agreed with my proposals for no additional B-1 bombers or Minuteman III missiles. Despite that agreement, the House Appropriations Committee recommended that no Congressional action be taken to rescind funds previously appropriated for the same purposes. This means that the Congress will force the Defense Department to produce weapons systems that the Congress has agreed are no longer needed.
Mr. Speaker, my opinion is that this matter has not yet been fully considered and I hope that you will personally help me to prevent a serious mistake.
Additional B-1 bombers and Minuteman III missiles are simply not needed to defend our country. The enclosed summary sheet outlines the reasons for my concern. The Secretary of Defense and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be glad to provide further information and the reasons for our urgent request that you and the House give this matter further consideration.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 20515]
Dear Senator Byrd:
I have sent the enclosed letter to Speaker O'Neill about my concern that over one-half billion dollars may be wasted on unneeded B-1 bombers and Minuteman III missiles.
I hope that you and the Senate will assist me in this effort to avoid unneeded spending.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Robert Byrd, Majority Leader, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510]
