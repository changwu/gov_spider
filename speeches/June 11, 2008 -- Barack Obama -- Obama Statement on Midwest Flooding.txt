    Chicago, IL - Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement in response to major flooding in the Midwest.
"My heart goes out to the families in Illinois and across the Midwest, who have been forced to flee their own homes, and leave their businesses and communities behind. Right now, many of them are wondering when they'll be able to return, and what they'll find when they get there. While we cannot assure them that their communities will be rebuilt overnight, we can assure them that they will be rebuilt â€” because we'll work to ensure that the full resources of our state and federal government are there to help. And I will do everything in my power to see to it that those resources get to the people who need them as swiftly as possible."
