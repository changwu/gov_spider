    As a result of this landmark tax relief agreement, the American taxpayers will have more money in their pockets to save and invest, and the economy will receive a much-needed shot in the arm. I commend the Members of the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, who made this happen. Tax relief is a centerpiece of our American agenda, and I look forward to signing it into law.
