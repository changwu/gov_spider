    President Bush will welcome British Prime Minister Tony Blair to the White House for a meeting and dinner on July 17, 2003. The United Kingdom is one of America's closest allies and is working together with us on a wide range of issues, including bringing peace and democracy to Iraq; advancing the cause of peace in the Middle East; fighting terrorism; rebuilding Afghanistan; preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction; and promoting economic growth and improved health care in developing nations. The United Kingdom has earned the lasting gratitude of the American people for the enormous sacrifices it made in contributing armed forces to fight alongside United States forces in the war in Iraq.
