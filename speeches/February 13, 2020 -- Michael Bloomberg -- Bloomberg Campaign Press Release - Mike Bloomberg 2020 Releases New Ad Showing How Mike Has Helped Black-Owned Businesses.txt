    The new TV ad, entitled "Cheryl," features the President and CEO of the nation's oldest Black-owned Design and Construction Firm
NEW YORK â€” Today, the Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign announced the launch of "Cheryl," a powerful new campaign ad that shows how Mike Bloomberg has helped Black-owned businesses thrive.
The TV ad is running nationwide on network, cable and local markets in 26 states.
It features Cheryl McKissack, the President and CEO of McKissack and McKissack, who represents the fifth generation of the family's design and construction business. McKissack and McKissack, which has offices in New York and Philadelphia, is the nation's oldest Black-owned design and construction firm.
McKissack discusses how difficult it was to get the contracts her company needed, saying there were not many opportunities for Black-owned businesses to compete. She says Mike Bloomberg saw that and he leveled the playing field.
"Over the years we have heard a lot of talk" McKissack says in the ad. "But, Mike came in and actually did something about it. That's how Mike will get it done as president."
Mike understands that a strong Black economy is a strong American economy. Mike's Greenwood Initiative would boost Black-owned businesses by setting up user-friendly one-stop shops for entrepreneurs across the country, expanding mentorships and incubators, increasing access to capital, supporting Black-owned banks, and expanding procurement from Black-owned businesses.
Mike has an extensive record of supporting Black-owned businesses. As mayor, he broadened access to city contracts for women and minority-owned businesses. As a result, the value of contracts awarded to minority and women owned businesses grew to $3.5 billion in New York.
