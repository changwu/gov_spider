    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Protocol to the Convention between the United States of America and the French Republic with respect to Taxes on Income and Property of July 28, 1967, as amended by the Protocols of October 12, 1970, November 24, 1978, and January 17, 1984, which Protocol and related exchange of notes were signed at Paris on June 16, 1988. I also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect thereto.
The main purpose of the Protocol is to modify the Convention to take into account the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In addition, the Protocol will permit France to exempt U.S. citizens resident in France from French tax on their U.S.-source investment income.
It is most desirable that this Protocol, together with the related exchange of notes, be considered by the Senate as soon as possible and that the Senate give advice and consent to ratification.
