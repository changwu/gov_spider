    Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole released the following statement today on the return of astronaut Shannon Lucid:
"Elizabeth and I would like to extend our deepest congratulations and a warm welcome back to terra firma to our newest American hero, Shannon Lucid. Her record breaking 188 days in space showed all of as the courage and strength through adversity that define the American spirit. In her time on the Mir space station, she advanced our continuing quest for knowledge and stretched the limits of our imagination a little further.
"There's always room in the record books for an American with the dedication and drive to go that extra mile... or, in this case, that extra 75 million miles. Welcome home!"
-- Bob Dole
