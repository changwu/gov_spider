    Today, Vice President Kamala Harris called into a Planned Parenthood summit, which convened hundreds of advocates who have been fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive rights.
President Alexis McGill Johnson applauded Vice President Harris for her leadership and steadfast support. She thanked the Vice President for reaffirming that the Biden-Harris Administration will keep fighting to protect reproductive health care and abortion access.
The Vice President thanked the advocates and leaders for their dedication to organize and fight for freedom and justice across the country. The Vice President highlighted the importance of coalition-building and urged the advocates to continue their momentum. She encouraged them to monitor upcoming state legislative sessions and stand up for abortion access at the state, local, and federal level. She called on Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, which would codify the protections of Roe v. Wade.
The Vice President emphasized the importance of reminding people they are not in this fight alone and reminded the advocates that together they will continue fighting to ensure that all people in our country are treated with dignity and that their rights are defended and preserved.
