350 Public Officials and Party Activists from Across Ohio Unveiled at Kasich Debate Send-off Rally in Westerville
Today, Kasich for America announced its Ohio Leadership Team — 350 public officials and Republican Party activists from across the state who have all officially endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President, and who will work to deliver the state for the governor. The Leadership Team was unveiled at a rally for Gov. Kasich in Westerville, Ohio, on the day before the third Republican primary debate in Boulder, Colorado.
The Ohio Leadership Team consists of sitting and former Members of Congress and state legislators, local government officials at all levels, and Republican Party officials and activists. They will work under the direction of Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, Attorney General Mike DeWine, Auditor of State David Yost and Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, the four Kasich for America state co-chairs announced in early September. Ohio Secretary of State John Husted also endorsed Kasich, but because of his role as Ohio's chief elections officer, he cannot be officially involved in the campaign.

Ohio is a must-win state, and no Republican has ever won the Presidency without carrying Ohio. According to a Quinnipiac poll released earlier this month, Kasich enjoys strong support in his home state where a record 62% of Ohioans approve of his job performance.
"This is a truly remarkable team, and I am humbled by this tremendous outpouring of support," said Kasich. "We know the winning formula — by cutting taxes, creating jobs and balancing our budget, together, we have gotten Ohio back on track. It worked here, and it will work in Washington."
