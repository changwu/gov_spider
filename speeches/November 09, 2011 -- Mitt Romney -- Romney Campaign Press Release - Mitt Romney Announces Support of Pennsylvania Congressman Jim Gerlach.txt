    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Pennsylvania Congressman Jim Gerlach.
"President Obama's massive stimulus bills have not helped Pennsylvania," said Mitt Romney. "Instead of creating jobs, President Obama has just increased government spending. I will work with leaders like Congressman Gerlach to cut spending and get our economy on the right track so that Pennsylvanians know their children will have a bright future."
"It is clear that President Obama's policies of the last three years have failed," said Congressman Jim Gerlach. "At a time when our budget deficits have skyrocketed and unemployment remains dangerously high, we need a radically different approach in Washington. Mitt Romney has demonstrated that conservative leadership and solutions can fix the problems our country faces. I look forward to working with him to address these issues."
