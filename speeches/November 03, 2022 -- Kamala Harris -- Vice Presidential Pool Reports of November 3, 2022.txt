VP Travel Pool Report #3 - Viewing
At approx 4:30, after an uneventful motorcade ride, VP made an unannounced visit to Abyssinian Baptist in NYC to pay respects to the late Rev. Calvin Butts. Was inside for roughly 10 mins.

VP Travel Pool Report #4 - GOTV Barnard Event
VP arrived at Barnard College around 5, where the Dem get out the vote event was already underway. Room full with a few hundred supporters and students. Back of stage was checkered with Hochul and "New York Women Vote" signs.
VP finished out the program, coming after Hillary Clinton and NY Gov Kathy Hochul.
VP took the stage at 6:16 and spoke for 22 mins. She was welcomed with a large cheer. Unlike the speakers before her, she took the stick mic and walked around the stage (like POTUS at recent events).
She likened voting to "putting in an order," saying that because people did so in 2020, the Biden admin was able to do gun reforms, climate investments, get Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on the bench, cancel student loan debt, etc.
In particular, she touched on abortion rights, encouraging people to vote for Hochul: "We're going to need people in the state house and at a local level who have the courage to stand up and push back against what is happening …. Who is your governor matters."
More on abortion: "The idea that anyone who proposes or professes to be a leader would suggest that there would be no exception after an individual has endured and survived an act of violence and violation, and then suggest to them they will not have the autonomy after the violation of their body to make a decision about what next happens to their body is immoral."
At one point, VP noted she has spoken with many foreign leaders. A person in the crowded shouted "slay," to a round of laughter.
At the end of the remarks, VP worked the rope line for a few mins.
Motorcade Barnard at 6:48 en route to LaGuardia.
Notable quotables from other speakers (all Dems):
Gov. Kathy Hochul:

Warns that folks like Trump get elected and rights get ripped away "when complacency sets in"

Hilary Clinton:

"They're going to cut social security and Medicare to give more tax cuts to the wealthy"
"They don't care about making you safe, they want to keep you scared." (On Republicans and crime messaging)

NY AG Letitia James:

"They're climate deniers. They're election deniers. They're gun control deniers."
"MAGA Republicans have been clear about where they will take us … now we must be equally clear that's not the New York and that's not the America that we want."

Full rundown of speakers, courtesy of VP's team:
- Hannah Bloomquist, Student- Catherine Sawoski, Student- Congresswoman Nydia Velasquez (D-NY-07)- Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-NY-35), New York Senate Majority Leader- Councilwoman Adrienne Adams (D-NY-28), Speaker, New York City Council- Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader- Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY)- Attorney General Letitia James (D-NY)- Hillary Clinton, Former Secretary of State- Governor Kathy Hochul (D-NY)- Vice President Kamala Harris
