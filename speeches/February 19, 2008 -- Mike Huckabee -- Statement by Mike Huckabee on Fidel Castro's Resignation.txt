    Little Rock, AR -- Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has issued the following statement in response to the resignation of Cuban President Fidel Castro:
"The Cuban people deserve nothing less than free and fair elections which would provide the only hope for a prosperous and democratic Cuba. Until Fidel Castro is dead there can be no significant movement towards reform in Cuba. Raul Castro has proven that he's as much a tyrant and dictator as his brother Fidel. Simply providing more power to another dictator does nothing to promote freedom and democracy to the Cuban people."
