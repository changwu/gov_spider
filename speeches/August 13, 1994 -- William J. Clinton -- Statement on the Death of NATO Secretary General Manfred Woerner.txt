    It was with deep sorrow and regret that I learned today of the death of NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. On behalf of the American people, I convey the United States' most heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Woerner and the Woerner family.
As Secretary General of NATO for the past 6 years and as a distinguished German statesman over the two preceding decades, Manfred Woerner's heroic leadership made an enduring contribution to democracy and security in Europe. He was a true and loyal friend of the United States and provided wise counsel to me and other Alliance heads of state and government. Even while he bravely fought his illness, Manfred Woerner worked tirelessly to transform our Alliance to meet the new challenges of the post-cold-war era and to direct its critical involvement in the search for peace in Bosnia. Manfred Woerner's central role in forging NATO's partnership with the new democracies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union was a major contribution to our common effort to build an integrated transatlantic community.
I will miss the candor, the friendship, and the good humor that Manfred Woerner displayed to the very end of his life. The transatlantic community has lost one of its finest citizens and leaders.
