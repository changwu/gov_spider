    This afternoon, President Obama called Duke University menâ€™s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski to congratulate him and his team on their championship and to invite them to the White House. The President also spoke to members of the Butler University team and their coach Brad Stevens. He told them they played a great game, showed tremendous heart, and he hopes to get a chance to play with them.
A photograph of the President during his call to Duke Coach Krzyzewski is available HERE.
