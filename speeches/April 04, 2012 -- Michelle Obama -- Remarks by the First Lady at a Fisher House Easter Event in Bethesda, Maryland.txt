    MRS. OBAMA: Hey! (Applause.) You guys, thank you so much. It is always one of my favorite things to come visit Fisher House, and -- because this house is a home away from home to so many of our military families. The work they do here is amazing. Every single house that I have visited is just like this -- the level of quality, the level of comfort, the staff is always is amazing.
But what I always say is that you all deserve this. Our military families, our troops -- you all deserve this kind of high-level treatment for what you go through for this country, for what you sacrifice. This should be the kind of place that welcomes you in times like these. So we always are just thrilled to shine a light on the good work.
But I just didn't come to visit; I'm going to come around to tables. But I come bearing treats: I've got Easter cookies from the White House. (Laughter.)
CHILD: Yay!
MRS. OBAMA: And I've got -- oh, this -- I'm going to put this here. We've got some Easter cookies -- we've got enough for everybody to have an Easter cookie. And I have a second surprise, which is I also brought tickets to the Easter egg roll for everybody here, on Monday. (Applause.) Easter egg roll tickets! (Laughter.)
So you guys are all invited to the White House. We've got -- yes, do you have a question? (Laughter.) Yes, it's very exciting. We've got -- it's going to be so much fun. And parents who are coming -- yes, people come to the White House dressed up, but the Easter egg roll is fun. We've got hula-hooping, and we've got tennis, and we've got games. So come ready to play, okay? Come ready -- are you ready to play?
And I have a final treat, which is I think the most important treat: I brought one of my best friends in the whole world, my only son -- I brought with me today -- I brought Bo. (Laughter.)
All right, so I'm going to come around. Do you guys want to see Bo?
