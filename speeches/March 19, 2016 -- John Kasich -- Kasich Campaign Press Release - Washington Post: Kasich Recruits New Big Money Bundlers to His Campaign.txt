As of Friday, Kasich had picked up a handful of new "bundlers," including billionaire businessman and philanthropist Robert Day; billionaire developer Rick Caruso; Bobbie Kilberg, a longtime GOP fundraiser based in Northern Virginia; and Richard Roeder, a California venture capitalist, campaign aides said.
Day donated $1 million to Right to Rise USA, the super PAC that supported Bush's presidential campaign. Roeder gave $25,000 to that group and donated to Rubio and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who dropped out of the race shortly before Christmas.
Kilberg was one of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's most steadfast financial supporters. After Christie gave up his presidential bid, she and her husband, Bill, became co-chairs of Bush's finance committee. She heads a Virginia technology trade association.
Caruso, who has flirted with running for mayor of Los Angeles, has been unaffiliated with any GOP presidential campaign this cycle, but he helped raise money for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. More recently, Caruso's son, Greg, gained attention among political types during a Republican presidential debate broadcast by CNN. Seated behind moderator Jake Tapper, the younger Caruso was dubbed "Hot Debate Guy" on social media by viewers intrigued by his looks.
More bundlers, who can help Kasich raise the millions needed to continue his campaign, are set to be announced in the coming days, the governor's campaign aides said.
