    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Hatch (R) Utah and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports S. 2869, sponsored by Senators Hatch and Kennedy, which would provide important protections for religious exercise in America. This bill would, in certain cases, forbid State and local governments from imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion unless they could demonstrate that imposition of such a burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. This bill would protect the exercise of religion in two situations: (1) where State and local governments seek to impose or implement a zoning or landmark law in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise; and (2) where State and local governments seek to impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of persons residing in or confined to certain institutions.
