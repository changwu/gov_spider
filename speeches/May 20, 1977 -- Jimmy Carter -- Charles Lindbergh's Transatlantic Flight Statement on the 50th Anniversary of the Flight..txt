    This year marks the 50th anniversary of the historic transatlantic flight of Charles A. Lindbergh. In his solo journey from New York to Paris on May 20, 1927, America's "Lone Eagle" inaugurated a new age of aviation and a new era of international flight.
Celebrated around the world, this momentous event established Lindbergh as one of our country's most heroic figures. It symbolized the continuing devotion of our people to the exploration of new frontiers and demonstrated what can be accomplished when innovative and promising technology is guided by a courageous and determined man.
Linking two continents, the 33 1/2-hour flight of the Spirit of St. Louis was a landmark in aviation history. It initiated the rise to world leadership of the United States aviation industry. It pioneered international air travel that has helped to bring nations and peoples far closer together and was the critical first step in our subsequently brilliant history of space discovery.
It is most fitting for all of us to join in a solemn commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's flight and in grateful celebration of the enduring accomplishments it inspired and made possible.
