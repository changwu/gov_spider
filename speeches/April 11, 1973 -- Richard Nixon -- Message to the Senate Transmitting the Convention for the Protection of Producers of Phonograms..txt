    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention for the Protection .of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms done at Geneva October 29, 1971. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report from the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The present Convention is designed to deal with the worldwide problem of unauthorized duplication of phonograms (i.e., records and tapes). The problem is urgent and growing. The value of pirated records and tapes in the United States alone has been estimated at one hundred million dollars. Protection against this illicit practice is needed to encourage the creative contributions of those who produce phonograms, the performing artists and the authors whose talents give phonograms their value.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention submitted herewith and give its advice and consent to its ratification.
