    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Supplementary Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, with annex, signed at Washington on June 25, 1985.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Supplementary Treaty.
The Supplementary Treaty adds to and amends the Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom, signed at London on June 8, 1972.
It represents a significant step in improving law enforcement cooperation and combatting terrorism, by excluding from the scope of the political offense exception serious offenses typically committed by terrorists, e.g., aircraft hijacking and sabotage, crimes against diplomats, hostage taking, and other heinous acts such as murder, manslaughter, malicious assault, and certain serious offenses involving firearms, explosives, and damage to property.
The Supplementary Treaty, in addition to narrowing the application of the political offense exception to extradition, will also help improve implementation of the current Extradition Treaty in several other respects. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Supplementary Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
