    Gov. John Kasich was in Reno, Nevada this week for a Meet & Greet event and to ask for support of his candidacy for President. Read an excerpt below from a Reno Gazette-Journal story:
About 75 people showed up to the Washoe County Republican Headquarters to hear Kasich and ask him questions. The Ohio governor spent most of his speech sharing his story about coming from a low-income family, eventually rising to the rank of congressman.
"I decided to get in this thing late," he said. "Most people here have no clue who I am, but I'm now running second in New Hampshire according to three of the last four polls."
He heavily referenced his time in Congress during the late 1990s spent balancing a budget â€” the last time a surplus happened.
Kasich spent the earlier part of Tuesday at a fundraiser at the Eldorado before meeting with Gov. Brian Sandoval.
After his short speech at Republican headquarters, Kasich took questions from the crowd about issues like Social Security, balancing the budget and federal land ownership.
"I want to tell you as I learn more and more, clearly the West, we have to begin to look at the issue of the federal government owning 86 percent of the land in this state and then not using common sense whenever they carry out the regulations," he said.
The crowd was combative with Kasich at times, including a debate about Social Security and his stated support of Congress' repeal of Glass-Steagall, but were generally receptive and often applauded.
Jerry Murray, 82, of Reno, said he enjoyed hearing the governor, but wasn't sure he could have a good showing in Nevada.
