    Today's decision by the Supreme Court in the Vernonia School District v. Acton case sends exactly the right message to parents and students: drug use will not be tolerated in our schools. The decision reinforces the point that young people should not use drugs.
I applaud the decision of the Supreme Court which upholds the right of the Vernonia (Oregon) School District to conduct random drug testing of school athletes as one effort by local school authorities to reduce drug use among students.
The Solicitor General argued strongly in support of the school district's position. My administration's support for the right of school officials to properly test their high school athletes is part of our overall strategy to make schools places where young people can be safe and drug-free. I believe that to be a good student or a good athlete a student cannot use drugs. Drug use at schools will not and should not be tolerated.
