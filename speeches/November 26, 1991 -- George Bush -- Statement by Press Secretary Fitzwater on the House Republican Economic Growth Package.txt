    Congress has had many months to pass our economic growth package. The President regrets Congress' inaction. He is enthusiastic about the House Republicans' efforts to advance a responsible growth package. As we said last night, the President reviewed the package with Bob Michel and Newt Gingrich and told them unequivocally that he liked the package and supports their efforts to advance the growth agenda.
