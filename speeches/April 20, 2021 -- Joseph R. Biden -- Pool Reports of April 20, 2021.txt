"I've come to know George's family," he said.
"And his brother, both brothers," Biden added.
He spoke of the "Pressure and anxiety" they're going through.
"I waited until the jury was sequestered and I called."
"They're a good family."
"And they're calling for peace and tranquility."
He said he was praying that the verdict was the "right verdict," and made a suggestion the evidence was overwhelming.

Pool Report No. 16 - two minute warning 
Two minute warning at 7:05 p.m.
Earlier, at 6:18 p.m., second gentleman Doug Emhoff was escorted in and was standing on the Grand Staircase, overlooking the event. He then moved back into the hallway.
Some White House staff walked in at 6:43 p.m. including Susan Rice, Tina Flournoy, Dana Remus and Anita Dunn. There were small white pieces of paper on the floor that said "reserved" that marked where they were supposed to stand, so they could be a few feet apart. Looked like three feet, not six.
Later Symone Sanders joined the group. And a few minutes later, Emhoff reappeared.
First lady Jill Biden joined the group at 7:05 wearing a Navy suit and pearls.
