    Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin of Ireland and wished him a happy St. Patrick's Day. The Vice President expressed her regret that she will be unable to host the St. Patrick's Day Breakfast in honor of the Taoiseach and Mrs. Mary Martin. The breakfast at the Naval Observatory was cancelled out of an abundance of caution following the Second Gentleman testing positive for COVID-19.

The Vice President underscored the importance of continuing to work together to strengthen our bilateral relationship as we take on global and regional challenges together.

The Vice President thanked the Taoiseach for Ireland's leadership in providing humanitarian assistance and support for refugees. They agreed to continue to stand with the people of Ukraine. The Vice President and the Taoiseach also discussed their continued support for the Good Friday Agreement.
