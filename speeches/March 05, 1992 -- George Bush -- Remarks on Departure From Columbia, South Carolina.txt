    Hey, listen, let me just ask you now to go out and be sure to vote on Saturday and send the rest of the Super Tuesday States a strong message. I want to be your President for 4 more years, so give me that vote. And thanks for your fantastic support, and don't let all the doomsayers get you down. I love this South Carolina optimism, the South Carolina pride, the South Carolina patriotism.
So thanks for this warm welcome. Now we're off to Tennessee, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, and then we're going to get back for a great big Super Tuesday. But show them what we can do on Saturday. And thank you for this great Governor at my side. Thank you all.
