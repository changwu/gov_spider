    I am pleased that Representative Jim Clyburn was elected by his colleagues to chair the Congressional Black Caucus. In January Representative Clyburn will begin his fourth term representing the people of the Sixth District of South Carolina. Throughout his career, he has been a tireless advocate for his constituents, and he has been a national leader on issues including rural economic development and affirmative action.
I commend outgoing CBC Chairwoman Maxine Waters for her outstanding leadership of the caucus, and I am confident that Representative Clyburn will be a most able successor. I look forward to working with Chairman Clyburn and the entire Congressional Black Caucus during the 106th Congress.
