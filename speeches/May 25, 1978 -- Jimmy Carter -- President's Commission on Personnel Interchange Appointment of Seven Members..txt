The President's Commission on Personnel Interchange was established in 1967 to develop an executive interchange program between the Federal Government and private industry. Each year, a small number of Federal employees take positions in the private sector, and a small number of industry executives are placed in Government positions. The Commission directs and monitors each year's exchange program.
