    I AM pleased to learn that the American Red Cross is responding to the appeal of the Greek Red Cross to assist in relieving the distressed victims of the tragic earthquake in Greece.
As Honorary President of the American Red Cross I am confident that the people of the United States will respond generously in helping to alleviate the suffering of the people of Greece who have contributed so much to our common cause of freedom.
