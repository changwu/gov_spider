    Barbara and I are greatly saddened by the death of Albert Bel Fay. Albert was a close personal friend, and we will miss him greatly.
He was a Texan through and through. He was a leader in building the Republican Party in Houston, starting in the early 1960's. Albert was a mentor who helped guide me in my early years in Texas politics, when getting Republicans elected was next to impossible. His service to the Republican Party has been invaluable.
Barbara and I send our deepest condolences and offer our prayers to his three children.
