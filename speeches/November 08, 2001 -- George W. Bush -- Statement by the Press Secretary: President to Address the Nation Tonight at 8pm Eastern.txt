    Excerpts From President Bush's Speech In Atlanta, Georgia
President Bush tonight will provide the American people a progress report on our war against terrorism, speak to the concerns of Americans, and discuss how they can contribute by saying:
"I came to Atlanta today to talk about an all-important question: How should we live in light of what has happened?"
The President will also reflect on how our nation has responded during a time of national tragedy saying, "None of us would ever wish the evil that has been done to our country, yet we have learned that out of evil can come great good. During the last two months, we have shown the world "America is a great nation."
The President will outline the actions the federal government is taking to strengthen homeland security while also reminding us of the values that guide us in the war against terrorism, saying, "Our great national challenge is to hunt down the terrorists and strengthen our protections against future attacks; our great national opportunity is to preserve forever the good that has resulted. Through this tragedy, we are renewing and reclaiming our strong American values."
