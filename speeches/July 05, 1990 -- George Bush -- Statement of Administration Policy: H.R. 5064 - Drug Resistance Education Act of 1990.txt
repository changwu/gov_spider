    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Final-Sent On 7/6/90)
(House)(Unsoeld (D) WA and 23 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5064 because it duplicates existing programs already operating in 49 States. Local school districts already can and do support these programs under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. In addition, the Department of Justice already supports the training of law enforcement officers who participate in these programs.
