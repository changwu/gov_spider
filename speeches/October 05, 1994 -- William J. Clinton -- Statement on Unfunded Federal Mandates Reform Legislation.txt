    I want to commend Chairman John Conyers and the House Government Operations Committee for adopting today the bipartisan "Federal Mandate Relief for State and Local Government Act of 1994" (H.R. 5128). This legislation, which I strongly support, will control the growth of Federal unfunded mandates and restore balance to the intergovernmental partnership between the Federal Government and State, local, and tribal governments. I encourage the House of Representatives to act on this legislation expeditiously.
