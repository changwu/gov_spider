    I applaud your leadership in initiating Texaco's program to alleviate home heating oil prices and supply hardships this winter.
Members of my staff have already met with Texaco representatives to assure that federal and local activities are coordinated with Texaco's program. In addition, I have sent a telegram to other oil companies asking that they take similar action.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
