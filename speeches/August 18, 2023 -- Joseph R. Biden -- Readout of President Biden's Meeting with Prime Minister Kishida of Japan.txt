    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David today to discuss global and regional security issues and to advance bilateral security and economic cooperation.
Both leaders affirmed their resolve to continue supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes as Ukraine defends itself from Russia's brutal and unlawful aggression. Recognizing the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, they committed to work together closely to address regional security challenges. The leaders expressed concern about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) recent dangerous behavior in the South China Sea to assert its unlawful maritime claims. They also reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
The two leaders also highlighted significant progress on defense cooperation, including plans to pursue a Glide Phase Interceptor cooperative development program to counter high-end hypersonic threats, which will strengthen regional deterrence and build on long-standing missile defense cooperation between the two countries to promote stability.
