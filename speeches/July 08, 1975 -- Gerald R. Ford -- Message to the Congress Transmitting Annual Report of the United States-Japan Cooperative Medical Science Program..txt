    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to present to the Congress the Eighth Annual Report of the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program. This bilateral research effort in the biomedical sciences was successfully implemented in 1965 following a meeting between the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of the United States.
During 1974, this Program has continued to direct attention to the study and prevention of a group of significant diseases which influence the health status of the people of Asia: cholera, environmentally induced diseases, leprosy, malnutrition, parasitic diseases (filariasis and schistosomiasis), tuberculosis, and vital diseases (rabies, dengue-hemorrhagic fever and other selected arboviral diseases).
The accomplishments attained during the past year are highlighted in the report of the Program which I am submitting to Congress today. I look forward to strengthening further the valuable and productive relationships provided by this model of cooperative international endeavor for the health benefits of our fellow man.
