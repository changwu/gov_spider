    Hillary and I were deeply saddened this morning to learn of the death of Leah Rabin. We have lost a dear friend, and the Middle East has lost a friend of peace. But the work to which she and Yitzhak dedicated their lives must and will continue.
Our prayers are with the Rabin family and with the people of Israel.
