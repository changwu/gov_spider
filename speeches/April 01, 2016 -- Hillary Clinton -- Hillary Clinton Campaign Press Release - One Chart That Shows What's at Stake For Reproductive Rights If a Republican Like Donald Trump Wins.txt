By now you've probably heard the news: Donald Trump said he believes women should receive "some form of punishment" for seeking an abortion.
But when it comes to women's health and reproductive rights, Trump is really not so different from the other Republicans in the race—just look at the facts.

1. As governor of Ohio, John Kasich has restricted abortion access: He signed into law a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy—which didn't include exceptions for rape, incest, or a woman's life. He defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio, cutting more than $1 million in funding for health screenings and HIV testing. And because of restrictions he's signed into law, the only two abortion providers in southwest Ohio could soon close—making it that much harder for nearly half a million Ohio women to exercise their constitutional right.
2. Donald Trump promised that he would shut down the government rather than fund Planned Parenthood, which provides vital health care including birth control, cancer screenings, and yes—safe and legal abortion.
3. This isn't a hypothetical for Cruz: As a U.S. senator, he was?actually?willing to shut down the federal government in an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.
4. As with all attacks on abortion access, 20-week bans are part of a deliberate, coordinated effort to chip away at women's constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. Abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are extremely rare but often take place under serious and complex circumstances—at a time when women and their doctors need every medical option available.
