    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On October 4, 1991, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), President Bush exercised his statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12775, declaring a national emergency and blocking Haitian government property. To further tighten the sanctions against Haiti, President Bush exercised his statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12779, and I acted pursuant to the same authorities as well as the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c), to issue Executive Order Nos. 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920, and 12922.
In view of the restoration of a democratically elected government in Haiti, and taking into consideration United Nations Security Council Resolution 944 of September 29, 1994, I have determined that the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States previously posed by the policies and actions of the de facto regime in Haiti has terminated. Today, pursuant to the above authorities, I have exercised my statutory authority to issue an Executive order to terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12775 and revoke the Executive orders referenced above imposing additional sanctions with respect to Haiti.
I have determined to issue the new Executive order terminating all remaining sanctions against Haiti in view of the return of Haiti's legitimately elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 944, which rescinds mandatory sanctions against Haiti previously adopted by the Security Council with our support.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
