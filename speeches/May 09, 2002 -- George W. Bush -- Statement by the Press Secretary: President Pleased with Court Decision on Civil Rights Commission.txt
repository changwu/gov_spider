    President Bush is pleased that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has unanimously affirmed the administration's position that Peter Kirsanow is a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. The Bush Administration is firmly committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and the Court of Appeals' ruling allows the U.S. Civil Rights Commission to move beyond the question of membership and get to the important business before it.
Peter Kirsanow was appointed to the Civil Rights Commission on December 6, 2001, to the expired seat of Victoria Wilson.
