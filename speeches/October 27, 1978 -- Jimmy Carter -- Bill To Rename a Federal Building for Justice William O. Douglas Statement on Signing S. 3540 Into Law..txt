    I am pleased and honored to sign S. 3540, a bill to rename the Federal building in Yakima, Washington, for one of the town's and the Nation's most respected and beloved citizensâ€”Justice William O. Douglas.
Justice Douglas' distinguished career on the United States Supreme Court spanned 36 years, the longest service on the Court in history. This remarkable man is respected around the world for the leadership and compassion he has shown as a fierce protector of individual rights, an advocate of the defenseless against oppression, and an activist on behalf of environmental preservation.
Justice Douglas richly deserves the recognition Congress has provided him by passing this bill.
