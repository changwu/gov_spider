    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the attached report, contained in the "Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1998" (Public Law 105-61; H.R. 2378). I have determined that the cancellation of this amount will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, together with its attachment, constitutes a special message under section 1022 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
