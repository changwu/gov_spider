This is my first time acting as a caucus precinct captain in a presidential election and it has been very rewarding.

When the campaign opened an office in Las Vegas last year, I jumped at the chance to join the first team of volunteers making calls to Marco's supporters there.

The team has also been organizing different activities every few weeks, like caucus training sessions onsite and at remote locations. Â 

The campaign has organized several events where congressional leaders and local leaders have come into the office and energized the volunteers.
Here we are with Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz:

As a precinct captain, I communicate with voters in my precinct and get them prepared for the caucus. 
Everyone in my neighborhood knows where to go if they are a Marco supporter, because I always display signs, bumper stickers, flyers, and caucus cards. Even my puppies get in on the action:

Since it's essential to keep up on the latest campaign news, we read The Daily Kickoff and listen to The Audible campaign podcast. I highly recommend both for your reading and listening pleasure.

Nevada's Republican Caucus is this Tuesday, February 23, and our team is excited to find so many energized Republicans vigorously supporting Marco Rubio in Nevada. 
I'm grateful for this opportunity to have found a great group of friends through this experience.
