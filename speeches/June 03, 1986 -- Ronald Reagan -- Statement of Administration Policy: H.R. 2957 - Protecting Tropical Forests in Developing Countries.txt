    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Yatron (D) Pennsylvania and 55 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2957 because it is unnecessary and duplicative of current law and practices; the bill also imposes additional unnecessary reporting requirements on the foreign assistance program. Enactment of this bill would decrease somewhat the flexibility of the Administration to provide foreign assistance.
