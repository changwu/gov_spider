    Today I am signing into law H.R. 6129, the "Agricultural Credit Improvement Act of 1992," which modifies the Farmers Home Administration program.
Although I have signed H.R. 6129, I will withhold my approval of H.R. 6138 because it is identical to section 24 of H.R. 6129.
George Bush
The White House,
October 28, 1992.
