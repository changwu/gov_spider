    I am signing into law H.R. 2321, the "Dayton Aviation Heritage Preservation Act of 1992," which establishes the Dayton Aviation National Historic Park in Ohio as an addition to the National Park System. The park will preserve certain historic sites in the Dayton, Ohio, area that are associated with the Wright brothers and the early development of aviation. The Act will recognize the national significance of these sites and the achievements of the Wright brothers, two of our most distinguished Americans.
The Act also establishes the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission to assist Federal, State, and local authorities in preserving and managing historic resources related to aviation in the Dayton area. The commission is composed of 13 members, most of whom are appointed by the Secretary of the Interior from recommendations of various State and local officials. The majority of members are effectively selected by various nonfederal officials and thus are not appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Article II, section 2, clause 2. Therefore, I sign this bill on the understanding that the commission will serve only in an advisory capacity and will not exercise Government power.
It should also be noted that the FY 1993 Interior Appropriations Act (Public Law 102 - 381) reduces the funds available for National Park Service management by approximately $42 million from my budget request. I question the wisdom of establishing new units of the National Park System that fail to meet the criteria established by the National Park Service when the Congress is not providing the existing system with adequate funding.
