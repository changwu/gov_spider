    Mt. Pleasant, SC - Rick Santorum wins the Iowa Caucus.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "We've had two early state contests with two winners - and the narrative that Governor Romney and the media have been touting of 'inevitability' has been destroyed.   Conservatives can now see and believe they don't have to settle for Romney, the Establishment's moderate candidate - who authored the model for Obamacare that provided taxpayer funded abortions, who boasted that he was more socially liberal than Ted Kennedy, and who supported Wall Street bailouts. There is a consistent conservative alternative who has the proven record of reforming entitlements, defending the unborn, and standing up for American exceptionalism around the Globe - and has proven that he is the one man in this race able to defeat Mitt Romney. That candidate is Rick Santorum. This latest defeat of Governor Romney in Iowa is just the beginning, and Rick Santorum is committed to continuing the fight as the clear, consistent conservative voice in this race.
