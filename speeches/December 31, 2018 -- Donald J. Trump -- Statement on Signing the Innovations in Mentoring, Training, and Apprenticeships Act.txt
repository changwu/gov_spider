    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 5509, the "Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act" (the "Act"). Section 5(b) of the Act, however, purports to require the Director of the National Science Foundation to submit a report to the Congress and to the public that includes legislative recommendations that could optimize the effectiveness of certain grant programs. My Administration will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President with the discretion to recommend to the Congress only "such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient".
