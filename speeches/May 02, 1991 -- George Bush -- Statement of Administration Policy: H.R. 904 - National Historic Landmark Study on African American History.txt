    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/3/91)(House)(Lewis (D) Georgia)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 904 but will seek amendments in the Senate to facilitate completion of the study by the National Park Service. These amendments include providing sufficient time for the study, limiting the scope of the study, reducing the level of the appropriation authorization, and eliminating requirements to use other organizations to prepare the study.
