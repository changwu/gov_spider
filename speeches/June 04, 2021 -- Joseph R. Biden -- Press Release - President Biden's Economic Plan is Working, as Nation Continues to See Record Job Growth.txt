    President Biden's economic plan is working. Today's employment data shows historic progress for American families and the American economy, including the lowest unemployment rate since before the pandemic, and the biggest decline in long-term unemployment in a decade. And it comes on the heels of yesterday's new unemployment claims, which show initial jobless claims have been cut in half since the President took office.
We are seeing record job growth for the first four months of a presidential administration – 540,000 jobs created each month on average – and American workers are seeing long-overdue wage increases. In the past few months, we've had the most job creation for the start of any American presidency – three times more jobs created than in the first four months of the Trump administration and eight times more than Reagan.
