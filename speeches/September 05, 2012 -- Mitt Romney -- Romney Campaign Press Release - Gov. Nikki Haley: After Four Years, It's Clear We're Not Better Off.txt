When you have a president that grades himself and says that he gets an incomplete, as a mom, I know when my children if they come home with an incomplete, it basically means they failed." â€“Gov.

GOV. NIKKI HALEY: "I think that the American public is now getting to the point where they're asking, are we better off than we were four years ago? And what they're seeing is their wallets are thinner. They all know someone that's lost a job. They see debt that their children are going to have to pay for. They wonder if their children are going to have to move back in with them because they can't find a job. All of these things that have affected them, they're looking back saying are we better off than we were four years ago. And the answer is very clear, we're not. When you have a president that grades himself and says that he gets an incomplete, as a mom, I know when my children if they come home with an incomplete, it basically means they failed. I think women are going to look at the whole picture. They are going to pay attention. I think you are going to continue to see those numbers move. Women are thoughtful, they're strong, they're smart. And they think a lot more than just one issue."
