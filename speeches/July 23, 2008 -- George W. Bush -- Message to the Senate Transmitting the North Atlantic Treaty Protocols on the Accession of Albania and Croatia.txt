    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Albania and the Republic of Croatia. These Protocols were adopted at Brussels on July 9, 2008, and signed that day on behalf of the United States and the other Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State, which includes an overview of the Protocols.
NATO enlargement remains an historic success in advancing freedom, stability, and democracy in the Euro-Atlantic area. Albania and Croatia serve as two more examples of countries motivated by the prospect of NATO membership to advance significant and difficult political, economic, and military reforms. Their efforts and success demonstrate to other countries in the Balkans and beyond that NATO's door remains open to nations willing to shoulder the responsibilities of membership. I am pleased that, with the advice and consent of the Senate, these new democracies can soon join us as members of this great Alliance.
I ask the Senate to join me in advancing the cause of freedom and strengthening NATO by providing its prompt advice and consent to ratification of these Protocols of Accession. My Administration stands ready to assist you in any way we can in your deliberations.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, July 23, 2008.
