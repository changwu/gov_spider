    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dymally (D) California and 21 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4720, but will continue to work closely with the Congress to avoid clearly unwarranted administrative difficulties and costs associated with H.R. 4720. Accordingly, the Administration will seek amendments in the Senate to enable the Census Bureau to preserve sufficient- flexibility to count overseas personnel in the most timely, cost-effective, and accurate manner, especially with regard to U.S. residence as applicable to overseas personnel for congressional apportionment purposes.
