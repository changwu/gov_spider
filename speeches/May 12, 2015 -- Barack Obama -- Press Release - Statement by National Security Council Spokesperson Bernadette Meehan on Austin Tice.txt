    This week, it is with a heavy heart that we mark American journalist Austin Tice's 1,000th day in captivity. Austin was abducted in August 2012 while reporting from a suburb of Damascus in Syria. An award-winning journalist and Marine Corps veteran, Austin entered Syria in May 2012 with a desire to report on the impact of the war on ordinary Syrians and an eagerness to help others – values that were instilled in him by his loving family and close friends.
The United States government will continue to work tirelessly to bring Austin home to his parents, Debra and Marc, and his brothers and sisters, who have endured anguish and suffering since Austin's abduction. We greatly appreciate the efforts of the Czech government, which acts as the U.S. protecting power in Syria, on behalf of our citizens, including Austin.
We strongly urge Austin's captors to release him so that he can be safely reunited with his family. We call on all those who may have information about Austin's whereabouts – governments and individuals – to work cooperatively with us to help bring him home.
