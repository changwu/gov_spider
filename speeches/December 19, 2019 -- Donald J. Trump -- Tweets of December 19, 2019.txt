I got Impeached last might without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles & not deliver them to the Senate but it's Senate's call!Retweets: 11157Favorites: 45916

Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up! The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!Retweets: 39395Favorites: 170586

The great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico & Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk for 8 months she doesn't even know what it says & today after passing by a wide margin in the House Pelosi tried to take credit for it. Labor will vote for Trump. Trade deal is great for USA!Retweets: 25089Favorites: 96267
