Boston, MA â€“ Today, Livingston County Sheriff Bob Bezotte announced his support for Governor Mitt Romney for President. Sheriff Bezotte had previously endorsed Senator John McCain.
In announcing his endorsement, Sheriff Bezotte said, "Livingston County citizens need a President with Governor Romney's leadership abilities and deep understanding of what it takes to get our economy back on track. A strong economy is essential for safe and vibrant communities. Governor Romney has the experience, vision and values to change Washington and rejuvenate our state's economy."
Governor Romney said, "I thank Sheriff Bezotte for his support and look forward to working with him to help Michigan get back on its feet. Having been born and raised in Michigan, it would give me great satisfaction to bring the type of change to Washington that can help Michigan.
