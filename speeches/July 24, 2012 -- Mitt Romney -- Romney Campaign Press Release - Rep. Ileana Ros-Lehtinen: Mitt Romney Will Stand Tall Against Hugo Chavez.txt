    Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's favorable comments about President Obama:
"To Hugo Chavez, Barack Obama 'deep down is a good guy.' The Venezuelan strongman clearly would prefer to maintain the status quo in the White House. But Chavez's policies of systematically dismantling democracyÂ in Venezuela and playing nice with America's enemies abroad need to be vigorously challenged. Mitt Romney will stand tall against Chavez and against all dictators in our hemisphere and around the world."
