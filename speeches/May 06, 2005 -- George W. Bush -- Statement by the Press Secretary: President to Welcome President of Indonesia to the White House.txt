    President Bush will welcome President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia to the White House on May 25. President Yudhoyono came to office last October in Indonesia's first direct presidential election, an event that capped a series of impressive democratic reforms in recent years. This will be President Yudhoyono's first visit to Washington in his current capacity, though the two leaders met on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Santiago last November. The two Presidents will discuss tsunami relief and reconstruction, as well as ways to strengthen further our cooperation on a range of bilateral, regional, and international issues.
