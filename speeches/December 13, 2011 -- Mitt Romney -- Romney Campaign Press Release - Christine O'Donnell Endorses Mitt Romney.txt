    Mitt Romney today announced the support of conservative activist Christine O'Donnell.
"Christine has been a leader in the conservative movement for many years," said Mitt Romney. "Christine recognizes that excessive government threatens us now and threatens future generations, and I am pleased to have her on my team."
Announcing her support, Christine O'Donnell said, "For me, this endorsement comes down to trust. I am endorsing Governor Romney because I trust him to do the right thing. He has the strength of conviction to do the right thing regardless of opposition. America needs a president who is not a Washington Insider. America needs a president who hasn't been playing the game for the last three decades. America needs a president who can turn our economy around, put Americans back to work, and will lead with stability, integrity and the values that we hold dear. I am confident Mitt Romney will be that president."
