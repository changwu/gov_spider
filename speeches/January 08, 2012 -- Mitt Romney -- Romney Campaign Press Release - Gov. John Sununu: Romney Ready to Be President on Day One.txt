    Governor John Sununu made the following statement on today's debate in New Hampshire:
"Mitt Romney again demonstrated what many in New Hampshire already know: he is ready to be president on day one. No other candidate possesses his knowledge of the economy or how jobs are created and no other candidate will be able to take on President Obama. On Tuesday, I encourage my fellow Granite Staters to support Mitt Romney as our party's nominee so that we can turn around our country."
