    This afternoon the President, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, and senior White House officials met with organizations committed to passing bipartisan commonsense immigration reform. The leaders of these organizations shared their concerns for the families facing the separation that comes from our broken immigration system. The President reiterated the deep concern he has for the pain these families face and that he has asked Secretary Johnson to do an inventory of the Department's current practices to see how it can conduct enforcement more humanely within the confines of the law. Secretary Johnson reemphasized his shared commitment to ensure our immigration laws are enforced effectively, sensibly, and in line with our nation's traditions as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. The President reiterated his commitment to maintaining consistent and sustained pressure on Congressional Republicans to take action on immigration reform as soon as possible. The President continues to believe that the only permanent solution to fixing the broken immigration system is through meaningful comprehensive legislation.
