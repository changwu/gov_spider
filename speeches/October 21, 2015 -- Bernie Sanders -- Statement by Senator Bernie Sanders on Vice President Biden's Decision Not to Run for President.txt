    PHILADELPHIA â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday issued the following statement on the announcement by Vice President Joseph Biden that he will not run for president in 2016:
"Joe Biden, a good friend, has made the decision that he feels is best for himself, his family and the country. I thank the vice president for a lifetime of public service and for all that he has done for our nation. I look forward to continuing to work with him to address the major crises we face. He understands the need to rebuild the middle class; and to address income and wealth inequality, a corrupt campaign finance system, climate change, racial justice, immigration reform and the need for publicly-funded higher education."
