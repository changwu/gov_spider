    The New York Times reports tonight on the growing list of prominent Republican leaders throwing their support to Governor Kasich's campaign.
An excerpt from their story is below:
"Gov. John Kasich's campaign said on Monday that it had gained another billionaire supporter: the hedge fund titan Julian H. Robertson Jr.
Mr. Robertson, who founded Tiger Management, will help raise money for the campaign, Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, said. On Sunday, the Ohio governor's campaign said it had won the support of another billionaire investor, Stanley F. Druckenmiller.
'We are really seeing a good response from donors who know that Governor Kasich is the party's best choice not just to win in November but to actually run the country,' Mr. Schrimpf said on Monday, which Mr. Kasich spent campaigning in Virginia.
Since Saturday's South Carolina primary, in which Mr. Kasich finished fifth, his campaign has rolled out a flurry of new donors and endorsements in an effort to show the viability of his campaign.
His newly announced supporters include Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania and homeland security secretary, and William F. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts."
