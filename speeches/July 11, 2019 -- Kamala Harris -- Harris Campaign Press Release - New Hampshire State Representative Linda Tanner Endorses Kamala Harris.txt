    Tanner Is the Latest in a String of New Hampshire Endorsements for Harris Following the First Democratic Debate
On the heels of her commanding performance in the first Democratic debate and ahead of her visit to New Hampshire on July 14, Senator Kamala Harris has been endorsed by State Representative Linda Tanner. Tanner is a four term State Representative, first elected to the legislature in 2012. She is an influential figure in Sullivan County politics.
"It is important to me that a leader is pragmatic but remains true to their core progressive values. That is why I am endorsing Senator Kamala Harris for President. She is a fighter for LGBTQI rights, social justice, women's rights, affordable healthcare, and public education. Her life's work and record in the Senate demonstrate her commitment to progressive values and her ability to negotiate for workable solutions," said State Representative Linda Tanner. "She has demonstrated her ability to seek the truth as well as her competitive spirit and fierce determination that will win our party's nomination and the Presidential election. She will be a strong, honest, and joyful warrior for the people. Please join me in supporting Kamala Harris for President."
Tanner joins former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Joe Keefe and fellow State Representative Dick Ames in endorsing Harris after the first Democratic debate. In their endorsements, Keefe and Ames both highlighted Harris's 3 a.m. agenda and noted that Harris is "the best candidate to take on Trump in 2020."
Harris will return to New Hampshire on July 14 for events in Gilford and Somersworth, where she will discuss her plans to deliver tangible solutions to the real challenges facing American families. Since announcing her campaign, Harris has traveled throughout the Granite State, visiting Portsmouth, Manchester, Concord, Keene, Hanover, Nashua, and Claremont.
