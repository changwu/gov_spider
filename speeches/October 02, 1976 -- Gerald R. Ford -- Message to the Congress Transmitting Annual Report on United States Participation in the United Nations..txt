To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the 30th annual report on United States participation in the United Nations and its many subsidiary bodies.
This report shows how the United States worked to advance its interests through the main activities of the United Nations system during Calendar Year 1975. It describes the outcome of important meetings such as the seventh special session of the General Assembly on world economic cooperation and the landmark International Women's Year conference; it covers the work of the Security Council in the Middle East and other areas; and it reports on such contentious political issues as the resolution of the 30th General Assembly equating Zionism with Racism with which we vigorously disagreed. These events, and many other UN activities, reflect an active year for the United States in the United Nations during which we persisted in our long-term effort to promote peace, economic progress and social justice within a worldwide framework.
In the area of security and crisis management, the United Nations was effective in carrying out its primary purpose: contributing to the maintenance of international peace. United Nations peacekeeping forces in both the Sinai and the Golan Heights areas of the Middle East' continued to separate previous combatants while the search for a more durable peace continued. Similarly, in Cyprus, United Nations peacekeeping forces helped to patrol the lines where confrontation existed and contributed to humanitarian needs. The Security Council, in addition to making the arrangements for the continuation of the mandates for these forces, also helped reduce tensions over the Western Sahara and East Timor.
A major area of activity of direct importance for American interests was the seventh special session of the General Assembly on development and international economic cooperation. Convened September 1 just prior to the 30th regular session, this meeting established a new agenda for international cooperation on the planning of our emerging global economic system. Prior to this meeting there had been division, confrontation and acrimony within the United Nations and elsewhere, over how to improve the world economic system and how to accelerate the process of development. Determined to make the most of this opportunity and to search for common ground, the United States outlined a broad program of practical initiatives which would be of benefit to both developing and developed countries. The participants in this historic meeting responded positively to the U.S. approach, adopting a consensus resolution which embraced most of our proposals. This session demonstrated that the UN can help to advance America's fundamental interests when we exercise leadership in the organization.
An international conference of great importance to the United States was the World Conference of the International Women's Year in Mexico City. This meeting, which grew out of a 1974 U.S. initiative, marked the first time that the problems of women had been the subject of such a major international conference. With some exceptions the conference recorded a number of major achievements. The United States made significant contributions to the World Plan of Action which was adopted at the conference, thus setting in motion a program that will gradually help the world to realize the full rights and potential of half of its people.
At my direction in November 1975, Secretary of State Kissinger sent a letter to the Director General of the International Labor Organization announcing our intention to withdraw from the organization in 1977 unless reforms are made before then. We cited four special areas of concern: erosion of tripartite representation; selective concern for human rights; disregard of due process; and increasing politicization of a technical agency. We took this step only after the most careful deliberation and, as we have stated, we will make every effort to promote conditions that could permit us to continue to participate in the organization.
The 30th session of the General Assembly was marked both by cooperation and contention. Many economic and social issues were debated, resulting in resolutions adopted by consensus. But political differences arose among the members over such issues as Korea, the Middle East, human rights and decolonization. Among other actions, a resolution equating Zionism with Racism was adopted over strong United States opposition. We view this resolution as a fundamental distortion of the truth and, as a result of its adoption, announced that we would not participate in the activities of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.
These are but a few of the important events in the United Nations during the past year. Much of the work of the United Nations is unknown because it is not regularly reported through the news media. The economic, social and technical coordination work of the United Nations, which account for more than 90 percent of its total resources, include such important activities as:
--Maintaining international aviation safety standards;
--Helping to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons;
--Working to combat illicit drug production and trafficking;
--Improving health conditions and standards worldwide and combating disease and plague;
--Setting improved international standards for the environment;
--Improving international food standards and preventing plant and animal disease from crossing borders;
--Providing economic development and technical assistance to the poorer nations of the world; and
--Providing food assistance and disaster relief. As the world's strongest economic power with the greatest global reach, the United States derives many tangible benefits from these United Nations activities, many of which resulted from American initiative and leadership.
Despite difficulties inherent in working within an organization of so many sovereign states having differing interests and backgrounds, I believe that we are making progress in achieving our purposes in the United Nations. The United States is working actively to defend its interests, to oppose irresponsible actions and to promote cooperation among UN members in fulfillment of the great purposes of the Charter which we helped to frame.
As the world grows increasingly complex and interdependent, I conclude that United States leadership and participation in the United Nations serves our interests and hopes for realizing mankind's aspirations for a world of peace, economic progress and social justice.
