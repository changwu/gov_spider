    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revision(House)(Kildee (D) MI and .95 others)
The administration supports reauthorization of the Older Americans Act and Native American Programs Act but strongly objects to many provisions of H.R. 1451 as reported.
Accordingly, the administration would not oppose House passage of the bill if it were amended to:

 reduce excessive authorizations in the Older Americans Act (OAA) for fiscal years 1988-1991, which are $1.8 billion above the total of $4.9 billion assumed in the President's budget for those years.
 eliminate earmarks in the OAA totaling over $200 million for new unnecessary programs between fiscal years 1988 and 1991, which would duplicate authority currently available and decrease State flexibility to determine priorities.
 incorporate reforms and improvements in the OAA advanced by the Administration for improved allocation and targeting of services to the elderly.
 delete the provision requiring the Commissioner on Aging to report directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which would impede effective management within the Department.
 eliminate requirements for numerous burdensome, costly, and unnecessary studies, reports, and data collections under the OAA.
 revise the provisions seriously impeding effective administration of the Native American Programs Act through restrictions on the rulemaking process.
