    Mitt Romney made the following statement on the results of the Puerto Rico primary:
"Ann and I are deeply grateful to Governor Fortuño, his wife Lucé Vela, and the good people of Puerto Rico for their support and help in winning the Republican primary. With a population larger than 22 states, this island contributes in so many ways to the vitality of our country. Under Governor Fortuño, Puerto Rico has made great strides in addressing longstanding problems afflicting its economy."
"Working to advance the fortunes of this island, and to better the lives of everyone living here, will be an important goal of my presidency. We won't get the economy going again by replacing one president with no job creation experience with another with no job creation experience. I've spent my life turning around failing enterprises. I have a plan to get government out of the way so we can create jobs and put people back to work. And that plan begins by earning every vote I can in order to send Barack Obama on his way."
