    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. de la Garza (D) Texas)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3492 because it appears to duplicate unnecessarily existing Federal programs that are available to all of our citizens. There is no need to develop and target specially tailored assistance for farmers and rural families. Moreover, the administration objects to the manner in which H.R. 3492 is being rushed to the floor. The bill was introduced and ordered reported on October 15th without the benefit of hearings or the opportunity for substantive comment by the administration.
