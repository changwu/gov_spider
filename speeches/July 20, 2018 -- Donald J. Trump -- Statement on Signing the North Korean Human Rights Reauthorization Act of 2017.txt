    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2061, the "North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2017". This legislation is intended to promote human rights and freedom in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Like its predecessor, however, H.R. 2061 contains a number of provisions, including sections 5(3), 7(c), 7(d), and 8(a)(2), that could be read to require the President to adopt a particular foreign policy of the United States or to direct negotiations with foreign governments and international organizations. (See Statement on Signing the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004.) Accordingly, I am directing my Administration to implement these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs.
