    President's Health
Q. How did it go, Mr. President?
The President. Very well. My eyes are still dilated, so I have to be a little careful. They're a little foggy out here.
But before I leave, I would just like to thank the Bethesda Naval Hospital for the wonderful care they have given to me and to members of my family over these last 8 years. This is a terrific place, and these people have been great to me, not only in all my physicals but when I was so badly injured and on other occasions when I or someone in my family needed it. I'm very, very grateful to them.
Q. How is the knee?
The President. Oh, my knee is great. My knee is great. You'll get a report. My cholesterol is a little too high because I haven't exercised, and I ate all that Christmas dessert. But in 6 months it will be back to normal. [Laughter] I knew I was doing it, but what the heck. It was my last time, and I wanted to enjoy it.
Thank you.
