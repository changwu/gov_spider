    The President today announced that he will nominate Stuart M. Statler, of Washington, D.C., to be a Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission for a term expiring October 26, 1986.
Statler has been chief counsel to the minority for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations since 1973, and counsel to Senator Charles Percy since 1971.
He was born June 15, 1943, in New York City. He received a B.A. from Amherst College in 1965 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1968.
From 1968 to 1970, Statler was special assistant to the Chairman of the National Commission on Product Safety, the Commission whose recommendations led to the creation of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
From 1970 to 1971, Statler was senior staff associate of the President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization, where he served on the Task Force on Independent Regulatory Commissions. From 1971 to 1973, he was minority counsel to the Senate Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization.
As chief counsel to the minority of the Investigations Subcommittee, Statler has been involved in a wide range of investigations of fraud, corruption, or misfeasance, many of which are related to consumer concerns. He has worked with business and consumer groups on legislation to create an agency for consumer advocacy.
