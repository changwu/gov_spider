    The Coalition of African American Ministers attended a private meeting today with leading Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower in New York City to discuss issues of faith, job creation, illegal immigration and unifying communities to Make America Great Again. The two-hour meeting was attended by dozens of Pastors and Bishops from across the country.
After the meeting Mr. Trump attended a large, impromptu press conference and stated, "This was an extraordinary meeting of religious leaders many of whom have decided to endorse me--- such a great honor! I look forward to future meetings with the Coalition of African American Ministers."
Bruce LeVell of Atlanta, GA said "The misinformation that Pastors and Bishops had heard in the past was quickly dispelled by having an honest discussion with Mr. Trump. He shared with us openly about the needs to help our communities as well as addressed important issues that have been cornerstones of his campaign. It is my honor to endorse Mr. Trump."
Pastor Darrell Scott, a member of the Coalition who also endorsed Mr. Trump and helped organize the meeting stated, "Mr. Trump is a real leader and I have great respect for his honesty and candor. He is going to make our country great again and I am proud to endorse his campaign for President."
The meeting was considered a great success by all those in attendance and many of the attendees were impressed by Mr. Trump's honesty, leadership and vision.
