Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce that Jill Latham has been named Deputy Campaign Manager.
Jill Latham said: "I am honored to take on this role with the Santorum campaign. Rick is not only the hardest working man in politics; he is the one candidate who has the conservative record to match his rhetoric. Rick won the Iowa caucuses the right way, traveling to all 99 counties, getting to know Iowans and understanding what they want in our next President - a man of conviction, honesty and the values we need in a President. I am proud to have the opportunity to join his national team as we work to defeat Barack Obama this fall."Â 
Rick Santorum said: "When expanding our national team, there is no one who would better fit this role than Jill, because it was through her planning and diligence that we were able to craft the campaign to defeat both Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the Iowa Caucus. Jill's experience on several presidential campaigns will be a terrific asset to our growing national campaign, and the entire team looks forward to working with her as we advance toward the nomination and a victory this November."
Jill Latham served as the Senior Iowa Advisor to the Rick Santorum for President campaign's victorious Iowa Caucus campaign. Prior to joining the Santorum Team, Latham served as Iowa Political Director for Governor Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, Political Director for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and as part of President George W. Bush's successful 2004 re-election campaign.
