    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Presidential Determination Under Section 1105(b)(1) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
Section 1105(b)(1) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Public Law 10048; 19 U.S.C. 2904(b)(1)) ("the Act"), provides that the President shall determine, before June 1, 1993, whether any major industrial country has failed to make concessions under trade agreements entered into under section 1102(a) and (b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (b)) which provide opportunities for the commerce of the United States in such country substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities, provided by concessions made by the United States under trade agreements entered into tinder section 1102(a) and (b) of the Act, for the commerce of such country in the United States.
Since the United States has not entered into any agreements under section 1102(a) or (b) of the Act, I hereby determine that there has been no failure to make concessions thereunder.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
