    Somersworth Mayor and Middle School Principal Dana Hilliard named National Co-Chair of Educators for Biden, calls Joe Biden a "champion for Granite State students and teachers"
Manchester, New Hampshire â€” Today, Biden for President announced New Hampshire Educators for Biden, including 50 educators from across the state who are endorsing Joe Biden for President. The campaign also named Somersworth Mayor and Middle School Principal Dana Hilliard as a National Co-Chair of the campaign's Educators for Biden effort.
"Vice President Biden is a champion for students and teachers. He understands that every single child in our state deserves a quality education, and that children can achieve the American Dream when they're given the right foundation to succeed," said Somersworth Mayor and Middle School Principal Dana Hilliard, National Co-Chair of Educators for Biden. "He also deeply understands the rigor and value of the work of teaching - and as President, will make critical investments in our future that are long overdue. As an educator, I'm proud to stand with Joe Biden."
Vice President Biden has long called for an increase in the quality of education in our country, and has said that access to education shouldn't be determined by one's zip code, parents' income, race, or disability. In May, he released a comprehensive plan to bolster the American education system from birth through 12th grade, including a commitment to increasing support services for both educators and students in schools. Biden's plan would give educators the pay and dignity they deserve - and invest in resources for schools so students grow into physically and emotionally healthy adults, and teachers can focus on teaching.
As President, Biden has also pledged to build an education system that starts investing in our children at birth and helps every student get education beyond a high school diploma.
