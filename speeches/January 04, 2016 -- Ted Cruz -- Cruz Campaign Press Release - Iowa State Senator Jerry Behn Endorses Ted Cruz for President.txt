    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ This morning during the first stop of the six-day, 28-county "Cruzin' to Caucus" Iowa bus tour, Iowa State Senator Jerry Behn endorsed Ted Cruz for President at King's Christian Bookstore in Boone, IA.
Behn is the Iowa State Senator from the 24th District and minority leader in the Iowa Senate.

"Jerry is dedicated to God and country, family and farming," said Cruz. "He stands for the principles that we all share, principles that this country was founded on. With Jerry's leadership it will help unite courageous Conservative across Iowa to reignite the promise of America. I am thrilled to have his support."
