    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Sharp (D) Indiana and 25 others)
While the administration believes that the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards should be repealed rather than modified, the administration would support enactment of H.R. 3399 if it contained only the CAFE provisions.
However, the President's senior advisers would recommend veto of H.R. 3399 or any similar bill that would: (1) require the Federal Government to purchase dual-fuel vehicles at up to a five percent premium in price, (2) require the retail selling of methanol, (3)  establish bus and truck demonstration programs, or (4)  otherwise subsidize or regulate alternative fuels.
