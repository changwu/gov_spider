Q. How was your——
The President. Really exciting. I miss flying, I can tell you that.
This is a formal press conference that you're now conducting. This counts.

The President. That's right.
Q. Mr. President, when you were flying the plane, what did you do? Did you steer it?

Q. Did you go straight, or did you turn it?
The President. Straight.
Q. How did you do? Did you waver?
The President. Ask the pilot.

Q. How does it compare to the jets you used to fly?
The President. Huh?
Q. How does that compare to the jets you used to fly?
The President. Much more sophisticated.
Q. What's it been like here on the ship?

Q. What have you been doing on the ship?
The President. I've mainly been talking to the troops.
