    These dedicated public servants and Justice Department veterans will restore the independence and integrity of the Justice Department, renew Americans' faith in the rule of law, and work tirelessly to build a more equitable justice system
WASHINGTON - Today, President-elect Joe Biden announced key nominations for the Department of Justice: Judge Merrick Garland, nominee for Attorney General; Lisa Monaco, nominee for Deputy Attorney General; Vanita Gupta, nominee for Associate Attorney General; and Kristen Clarke, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.
These nominees reflect the president-elect's deeply held commitment to reaffirming the Department of Justice as a pillar of independence and integrity, and ensuring that the Attorney General and his senior leadership team are the American people's lawyers — not the president's law firm. These leaders will work with the dedicated career professionals at DOJ to restore the mission and independence of the department, always follow facts and the law, and serve and protect the American people with the integrity they deserve.
They will use the full extent of their authority to move us closer to the American ideal of equal justice under law — de-politicizing and rooting out systemic racism from our laws, restoring voting rights, prosecuting hate crimes, eliminating racial disparities in sentencing, ending mandatory minimums, and restoring trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve through reforms that make our communities safer.
President-elect Joe Biden said, "Our first-rate nominees to lead the Justice Department are eminently qualified, embody character and judgment that is beyond reproach, and have devoted their careers to serving the American people with honor and integrity. They will restore the independence of the Department so it serves the interests of the people not a presidency, rebuild public trust in the rule of law, and work tirelessly to ensure a more fair and equitable justice system. They are among the most accomplished legal minds in our country who also reflect the best of America's full range of talents and background. I am honored they accepted this call to serve at such a critical time in our nation's history."
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said, "Fidelity to the rule of law forms the bedrock of America's democracy. And in the face of both the damage that has been done to our Justice Department and our country's long-overdue reckoning on racial injustice, these are the right leaders to meet this moment. These Justice Department veterans will not only help make sure justice is applied equally across our country, they will also restore integrity and independence to the Justice Department, helping rebuild the American people's trust in the institution. And I look forward to working closely with them to help America live up to the words etched at the United States Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law."
