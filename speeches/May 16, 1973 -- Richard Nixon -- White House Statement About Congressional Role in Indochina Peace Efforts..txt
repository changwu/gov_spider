    AFTER MORE than 10 arduous years of sacrifice and effort in Indochina, an equitable framework for peace was finally agreed to in Paris last January. This could not possibly have been achieved without the active support of Congress, especially in the last difficult years.
The President is very concerned that having persevered to success these long years, the Congress has, on the very eve of negotiations to achieve compliance with that settlement, taken action that could severely undermine prospects for SUCCESS.
It is the President's hope that as the legislative process unfolds, consideration of these matters will take place in the broader perspective of continuing negotiations.
The President, in full compliance with his constitutional responsibilities, is determined to achieve a cease-fire and withdrawal of foreign forces from Cambodia in accordance with the Paris agreements, and to secure the lasting peace in Indochina for which so many people have sacrificed so much.
