    Manchester, NH – At the end of a week that saw him roll out a comprehensive plan to revitalize rural America, Montana Governor Steve Bullock addressed the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention with a message of bringing people together to defeat Donald Trump and make government work again.
As the only candidate in the field to have won and governed a Trump state, Governor Bullock is uniquely qualified to bridge the divides not only in the Democratic Party, but across the country. Throughout his career, Bullock has worked to bring people together to get things done to make people's lives better. Time and again, he's made his case — successfully — to places Democrats have failed to win for decades. If we're going to beat Donald Trump, we need a candidate that can win back places we lost. Governor Bullock will do just that.
