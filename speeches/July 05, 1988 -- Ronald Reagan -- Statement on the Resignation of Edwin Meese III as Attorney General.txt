    I accept with regret Attorney General Meese's determination to step down. As the Attorney General said in his press conference today, he can look back with great satisfaction on the contribution he has made to the Department and to the administration of justice in general.
For more than two decades now, Ed has been a good friend and a close adviser. His gift for developing and succinctly summarizing policy options is one of the most unique I have encountered in my experience in government. Ed Meese has served the American people loyally and well. He has led the Department of Justice with courage and vigor, and his work on public policy has resulted in many outstanding accomplishments. Nancy and I wish him and Ursula all the best in their return to private life.
