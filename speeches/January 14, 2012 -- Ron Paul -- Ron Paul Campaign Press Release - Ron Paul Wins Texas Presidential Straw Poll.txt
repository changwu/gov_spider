LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul defeated his rivals for the GOP nomination in a straw poll conducted by tea party groups in his home state.
The 'Saddle Up Texas Straw Poll' featured in-person paper-ballot voting in Houston as well as a text-in vote.
Paul took first place with 27.9 percent of the 707 in-person paper votes tallied, besting his GOP competitors - including incumbent Texas Governor Rick Perry, who placed fourth earning just 19.4 percent. Newt Gingrich with 23.8 percent, Rick Santorum with 21.2 percent, Mitt Romney with 6.6 percent, and Jon Huntsman with 1.1 percent came in second, third, fifth, and sixth place, respectively.
Paul easily won the majority of the more than 3,300 text-in votes with more than 54 percent of votes cast.
"This straw poll was a tea party event. Its result is further evidence of the tea party and conservatives nationwide coalescing behind one candidate, Ron Paul, as the one true challenger and conservative alternative to Mitt Romney," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Ron Paul is the only candidate who can defeat Obama by energizing Republicans, tea partiers, independents, and disaffected Democrats."
