    "Republican primary voters may be surprised to learn that Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have a lot in common. Aside from being career politicians who embraced earmarks and voted to raise their own pay, both stayed in D.C. after leaving office and worked in the lobbying community. Mitt Romney offers something different. He is not a creature of Washington. He offers the kind of private sector and chief executive experience that career politicians can't match." —Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
Speaker Gingrich And Congressman/Senator Santorum Worked As "Consultants" For D.C.-Based Lobbying Shops:
Gingrich Was Paid As A "Consultant" To Support Freddie Mac's Lobbying Operation. "[Gingrich's] Freddie Mac work gives off a whiff of lobbying, according to the contract he just released. Specifically, the Freddie Mac executive who hired Gingrich was not the CEO, nor the VP for operations, or the VP for communications, but Craig Thomas, the VP for Public Policy — that is, the head of Freddie Mac's lobbying operations. Thomas was a registered lobbyist at the time." (Timothy P. Carney, "Gingrich Worked For Freddie Mac's Lobby Shop," The Washington Examiner, 1/23/12)

(Nancy E. Roman, "Gingrich Safeguards Pay Raise For Colleagues," The Washington Times, 9/28/97)
