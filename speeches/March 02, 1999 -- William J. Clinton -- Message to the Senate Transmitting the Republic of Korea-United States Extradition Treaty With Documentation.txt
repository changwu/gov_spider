    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea, signed at Washington on June 9, 1998 (hereinafter the "Treaty").
In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. The Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of the United States and Korea.
It will provide, for the first time, a framework and basic protections for extraditions between Korea and the United States, thereby making a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
