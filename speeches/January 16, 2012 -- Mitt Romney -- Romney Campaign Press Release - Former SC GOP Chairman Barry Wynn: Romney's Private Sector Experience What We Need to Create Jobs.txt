    Former South Carolina GOP Chairman Barry Wynn made the following statement on tonight's debate:
"Mitt Romney came out ahead in tonight's debate because he again showed that he is the best candidate to both take on President Obama and fix our economy. President Obama spent his life outside the private sector and it shows. Mitt Romney spent his life outside of politics, working in the real economy. In order to create private sector jobs in this tough economic environment, we need a president who worked in the private sector."
