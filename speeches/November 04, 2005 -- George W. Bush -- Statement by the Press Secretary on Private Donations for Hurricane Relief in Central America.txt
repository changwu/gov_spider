    Three distinguished private-sector leaders have agreed to launch a nationwide effort to encourage private donations for relief and reconstruction in response to the three recent hurricanes that struck Central America. These leaders will work with other Americans to raise awareness and resources to help those in need as a result of these disasters.
The business leaders are: Steve Reinemund, Chairman and CEO, PepsiCo, Inc.; Bob Lane, Chairman and CEO, Deere & Company; and Maria Lagomasino, Former Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Private Bank. On behalf of our country, I am grateful to these leaders for their readiness to take on this important effort.
In the coming days, they will ask Americans to donate directly to a fund set up to provide help to the disaster victims.
