    The Syrian government's offensive in northern Syria has created a humanitarian crisis. The United States calls upon the Syrian government to stop this violence, and to give the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) immediate, unfettered access to this region to care for the needs of wounded individuals, detainees, and internally displaced civilians. Syrian leaders have no excuse for denying humanitarian assistance by a neutral body like the ICRC. If Syria's leaders fail to provide this access, they will once again be showing contempt for the dignity of the Syrian people.
