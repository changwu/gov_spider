    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- The McCain-Palin presidential campaign today announced its Mississippi Statewide Leadership; this distinguished team will direct Mississippi's growing grassroots organization and communicate John McCain's message of peace and reform.
"John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin are maverick reformers with long records of working across the aisle to address the problems facing hard-working Americans," said Governor Haley Barbour, McCain-Palin State Chairman. "At this point in our nation's history, our country needs a proven leader with the courage, sound judgment and integrity to bring real change to Washington -- and Mississippians are excited about the opportunity to elect two of them."
Lt. Governor Phil Bryant, McCain-Palin State Co-Chairman, said, "John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin are true conservatives who understand the issues most important to voters in Mississippi: family values, energy independence and our nation's safety. While Senator Obama's liberal record is simply out of touch with what most Mississippians want in a leader, John McCain will keep taxes low, create jobs, strengthen our national security and work to find innovative solutions to reduce prices at the pump."
Senator Trent Lott, McCain-Palin Honorary State Chairman, added: "Whether during his service as a POW in Vietnam or as a senator in Washington, John McCain has always put our nation's best interests above his own or those of his party. There is no one Americans should trust more to make the difficult decisions necessary to move this country toward prosperity, peace and meaningful reform."
