    "I hear from small-business people day in and day out, 'Why is it that my government seems to think I'm their enemy?' They feel they're under attack by their own government. We got to change the attitude in this country. We've got to recognize we're all in this together. Let's not divide Americans. Let's come together and say to business creators, job creators, we want you to succeed. We want you to hire more people. How can we help? Government has to be a friend of the American people, not the foe." – Mitt Romney

BOB SCHIEFFER, CBS NEWS: "What have you learned out here on the campaign trail? You say you've been talking to regular folks. What are they telling you?"
MITT ROMNEY: "Well, it's fun going across the country. This has been a great and thrilling experience. I come away impressed with how patriotic people are; how much they love this country; how much they respect the principles that made us a unique nation. I come away impressed with the entrepreneurialism of the American people—in tough times a lot of people have found ways to make do and make better. People are, however, tired of being tired. These have been long years—three and a half years in a very difficult economy and, in a lot of cases, a lot of disappointment—disappointment with the president and with his policies. I hear from small-business people day in and day out, 'Why is it that my government seems to think I'm their enemy?' They feel they're under attack by their own government. We got to change the attitude in this country. We've got to recognize we're all in this together. Let's not divide Americans.
