    National Nursing Home Week is a time for us to remember in a special way the millions of older Americans who reside in the 19,000 nursing homes and long-term care facilities throughout the United States. This week we also salute the thousands of dedicated healthcare professionals and volunteers who work tirelessly to provide care and support to residents and their families.
This year's theme: "Nursing Homes: A Tradition of Caring," is a succinct description of the history and focus of these institutions. The residents of our nursing homes are men and women who helped make the 20th century the American Century. They are our mothers and fathers, our aunts and uncles -- people who raised strong families, who plowed fertile fields, who built great cities and defended the free world from the threat of totalitarianism. Now in their senior years, these generous, hardworking men and women need special care and attention. Nursing homes provide that care, helping to ensure that ill or infirm seniors are able to live with the dignity and comfort they deserve. Such service -- while in the finest American tradition of compassion and concern for all members of our society -- is but small repayment toward the tremendous debt we owe older Americans.
I encourage all Americans to join in observing National Nursing Home Week and saluting the unsung heroes who care for our Nation's elderly. I also urge every American to remember those who live in our Nation's nursing homes -- to show them our love and appreciation -- not only this week but also throughout the year.
Let it always be said that America honors and cares for her citizens in their golden years.
