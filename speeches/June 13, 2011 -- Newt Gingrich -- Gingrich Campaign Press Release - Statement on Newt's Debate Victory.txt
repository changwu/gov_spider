    Newt 2012 released the following statement from campaign Communications Director Joseph DeSantis:
Newt Gingrich clearly won the debate.
He cut through the clutter and spoke clearly. His message resonates. Newt decisively addressed the challenges facing the nation, the destructiveness of the Obama administration, and offered an optimistic vision for America's future.
Newt Gingrich is the only candidate offering solutions as big as America's challenges. And he has a track record of success to make these solutions a reality. Under his Speakership, over 8 million new jobs were created. Taxes were cut. Spending was cut. The budget was balanced. Hundreds of billions of dollars of debt were paid off. Surpluses were created.
Newt Gingrich's Jobs and Prosperity Plan is the boldest blueprint for turning our economy around and creating millions of new jobs.
His "Patient Power" healthcare plan to replace Obamacare is detailed and in depth, reflecting the decades he has spent studying the issue and would ensure healthcare for all without mandates or bureaucracy.
Newt is a national champion for an American Energy Plan. His Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less petition-drive energized the 2008 campaign and led to the end of the Presidential and Congressional bans on offshore drilling.
His authority and knowledge on these critical issues and more were on display tonight, showing everyone that Newt is the right man to take on President Obama in the general election and the right man to lead this country in these challenging times.
