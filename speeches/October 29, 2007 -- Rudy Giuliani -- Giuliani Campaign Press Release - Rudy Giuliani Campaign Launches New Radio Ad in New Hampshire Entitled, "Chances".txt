AUDIO
RUDY GIULIANI: "I had prostate cancer, five, six years ago. My chance of surviving prostate cancer, and thank God I was cured of it, in the United States, 82%. My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England, only 44% under socialized medicine."
RUDY GIULIANI: "You and I should be making the decisions about what kind of health care we get with our doctors, not with a government bureaucrat. What we need to do is to give people a $15,000 deduction for a family, a $7500 deduction for an individual so they can go out and by their own health insurance."
RUDY GIULIANI: "If we do that, and we end up with a market of 50, 60 million Americans buying their own health insurance, without a mandate, the cost of health insurance will come down and the quality will come up.
RUDY GIULIANI: "Government has never been able to reduce costs. Government never increases quality".
RUDY GIULIANI: "We have the best health care system in the world. We just have to make it better."
VOICEOVER: "Rudy Giuliani. Leadership. Principle. Results."
RUDY GIULIANI: "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approved this message."
VOICEOVER: "Paid for by Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee Incorporated. Visit joinrudy2008.com"
