Webb says he's "unbought" and "unbossed" and has his own mind.
The former Virginia senator spoke Thursday at the Iowa State Fair from the fair's political "soapbox."
Webb deplores the number of super PACs that are raising money to support candidates in the race. He says he doesn't have one.
Webb told fairgoers they should ask candidates who decry super PACs why they take the money. And he says if people want to change it, they should vote for him.
Webb also touts his military experience, saying he has the qualifications to be commander in chief. He was a Marine officer in Vietnam and later served as Secretary of the Navy.
