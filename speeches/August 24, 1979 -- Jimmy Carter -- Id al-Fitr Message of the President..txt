    On this joyous holiday of Id al-Fitr, ending the fast of Ramadan, Rosalynn and I extend our warmest good wishes to all of our fellow citizens of the Muslim faith.
The observance of your traditional religious ceremonies strengthens the moral and spiritual values of your Faith and thereby deepens our nation's commitment to our highest principles.
At this critical time, we join together in praying for a lasting peace that will bring justice and freedom to all people.
