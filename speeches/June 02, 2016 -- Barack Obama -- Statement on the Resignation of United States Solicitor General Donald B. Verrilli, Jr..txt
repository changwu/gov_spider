    For 5 years, Solicitor General Don Verrilli has fought in our Nation's highest Court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved America forward. Thanks to his efforts, 20 million more Americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care, we're combating discrimination so that more women and minorities can own their piece of the American Dream, we've reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that immigrants are treated fairly, and our children will now grow up in a country where everyone has the freedom to marry the person they love.
Don has been a dedicated public servant who has helped our Nation live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all. I am grateful for his trusted counsel and friendship. And I wish Don and his family all the best in what comes next, including, hopefully, a well-deserved vacation.
