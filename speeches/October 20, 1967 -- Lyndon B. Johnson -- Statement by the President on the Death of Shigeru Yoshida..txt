    THE PRESIDENT was deeply saddened to learn of the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. He is sending a message of condolence to Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and to the Yoshida family.
Mr. Yoshida was one of those extraordinarily few world statesmen who, during the troubled and critical period immediately following the Second World War, set the destiny of his country on the path of peace and democracy. As an esteemed eider statesman in his later years, his counsel continued to be highly valued. The United States will be indebted to him for his singular contribution to Japanese-American friendship and partnership. His loss will be deeply mourned.
