    I AM happy today to take a part in the 50th anniversary celebration of the motion picture theater. I have some very vivid recollections of the first ones I saw. In those days, admission was 5 cents and you could stay as long as you wanted to.
The great stars of that time, I judge, were-maybe I had better not name them, because some of them wouldn't like to have their ages stated. They had great comedians in those days, as well as we have today.
The show has grown to be one of our greatest assets in the dissemination of information and entertainment.
I just wonder what will be the situation 50 years from now? I hardly believe that I'll see it, but I hope I may. I know some of these young ladies will.
So I congratulate you on the 50th anniversary. I hope you will have 50 more prosperous years.
