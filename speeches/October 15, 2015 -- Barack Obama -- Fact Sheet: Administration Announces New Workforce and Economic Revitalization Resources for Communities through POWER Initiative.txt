    As part of President Obama's effort to assist communities negatively impacted by changes in the coal industry and power sector, today the Administration is announcing 36 awards totaling $14,546,457 for partnerships in 12 states and tribal nations that are seeking to build a more diversified and better economic future for their communities, businesses, and workers.
The Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Initiative is an Administration effort, involving multiple federal agencies, with the goal of effectively aligning, leveraging and targeting a range of federal economic and workforce development programs and resources to assist communities negatively impacted by changes in the coal industry and power sector.
The POWER Initiative is a down payment on President Obama's POWER+ Plan, part of his FY 2016 budget request to Congress. The POWER+ Plan proposes a roughly $10 billion investment in coal communities, workers and technology. But given the immediacy of the economic need in coal country, the Administration stood up the economic and workforce developments components of POWER+ utilizing existing funds.
In the spring of 2015, four federal agencies announced coordinated funding solicitations for grant awards on two parallel tracks to partnerships anchored in communities impacted by the downturn in the coal economy.
The POWER Planning Grants solicitation was released in April by the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) to assist community-based partnerships develop comprehensive economic development strategic plans for their regions.
The POWER Implementation Grants Federal Funding Opportunity (FFO) was released in May with available funding from EDA, the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA), the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The FFO made funding available to partnerships in impacted communities to help them: (1) diversify their economies; (2) create jobs in new or existing industries; (3) attract new sources of job-creating investment; and (4) provide a range of workforce services and skills training for high-quality, in-demand jobs.
