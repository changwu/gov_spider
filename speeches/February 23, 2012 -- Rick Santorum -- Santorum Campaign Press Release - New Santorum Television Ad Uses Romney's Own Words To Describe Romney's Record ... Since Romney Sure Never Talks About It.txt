    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President Campaign released a new ad statewide in Michigan that simply uses Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's own words to outline his positions.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "Since Mitt Romney refuses to talk about his own liberal record - we figured we'd show people what Mitt Romney says about Mitt Romney. We wanted to give Governor Romney's long-held positions and statements an opportunity to be heard."
