Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on former Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL) being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom:
"Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Henry Hyde has served his country with distinction and earned bipartisan respect and admiration for his wide ranging public service. From his service in the Navy as a young man to his long and distinguished career in the U.S. House of Representatives where he served as Chairman of both the Judiciary and International Relations Committee, Henry Hyde is a modern day Man for All Seasons who championed freedom here and abroad.
"On the foreign policy front, he was a champion of President Reagan's 'tear down this wall' foreign policy agenda. On the domestic front, Henry Hyde was quite simply the pre-eminent pro-life champion of our time. He provided a powerful and effective voice to the unborn and is a model for how principled and civil discourse can lead to changing of hearts and minds and creating a culture of life in which more children are protected under the law. Today, the Honorable Henry Hyde, his family and many friends can rightly be proud of his principled leadership."
