In-town pool report #5 
The motorcade arrived at Las Gemelas at Union Market in NE DC at 11:41 a.m
The President is greeting workers present, outside earshot of your pooler.
From the White House:
To highlight the successes of the American Rescue Plan, today President Biden will visit Taqueria Las Gemelas, a restaurant located in Northeast Washington, D.C. Las Gemelas means "the twin girls" in Spanish, named after partner Yesenia Neri Diaz's twin daughters.
The restaurant is owned in part by Mexican immigrants Yesenia Neri Diaz and Rogelio Martinez. At age 7, Neri Díaz learned to make traditional Mexican tortillas from her mother in Ahuacuotzingo, a small city in the Mexican state of Guerrero. Martinez learned how to cut meats from his father, who was also a butcher, in Mexico City.
Las Gemelas was a beneficiary of relief funding from the pilot program Restaurant Revitalization Fund – the administration's program to provide relief to restaurants, which were the first hit and the worst hit in the pandemic. The American Rescue Plan's Restaurant Revitalization Fund provides $28.6 billion in direct relief to restaurants and food and beverage establishments, and prioritizes restaurants that are women-owned, veteran-owned, and owned by other socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
During the pandemic, Las Gemelas went from 55 employees to 7. Through the Paycheck Protection Program, Las Gemelas was able to rehire their employees and provide back pay to those who returned. Now, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund allows the owners of Las Gemelas to complete delayed projects, provide raises to their staff, and operate with confidence again.
Today, on Cinco de Mayo, the administration is reminded of the resiliency and ingenuity of the Mexican-American community in difficult times. As our country recovers from the pandemic, the Biden-Harris administration is committed to providing relief to small businesses and restaurants across the country and revitalizing opportunities for immigrants to achieve the American dream.

In-town pool report #6 - President exits 
The president made at least three stops to speak with people inside the restaurant, while the pool held on the patio looking in through the open windows.
POTUS left the restaurant at around 11:54 a.m., he responded to a shouted question that he got tacos and enchiladas inside.
Your pooler heard the president say something to the effect of "I don't understand Republicans" in response to a question about Liz Cheney.
Will send more when I get video.
We're rolling.

In-town pool report #7 -- brief lunch lid 
Brief lunch lid was called until 12:30 p.m.
As always, check quotes against transcript and tape, but at the beginning the president was talking about the ARP.
"The restaurant industry was so badly hurt nationwide, and that's why we put this restaurant revitalization fund back together -- together. Like I said, this morning, as of this morning, 790,000 restaurants applied for help."
Toward the end, the pool could vaguely hear the president talking about Philadelphia sports fans.
"Philadelphia fans are the most informed, most obnoxious fans in the world. They know everything, you know what I mean?"
