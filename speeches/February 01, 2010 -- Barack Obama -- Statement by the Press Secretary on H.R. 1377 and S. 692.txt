S. 692, which provides that claims of the United States to documents relating to Franklin Delano Roosevelt that were in the possession of Grace Tully, his last personal secretary, at the time of her death are to be treated as waived and relinquished if any entity makes a gift of those documents to the National Archives and Records Administration.
