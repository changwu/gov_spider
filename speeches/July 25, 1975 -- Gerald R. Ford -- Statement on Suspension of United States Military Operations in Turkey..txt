    I DEEPLY regret the announcement of the Government of Turkey to suspend all American activities at joint U.S.-Turkish defense installations and to take over control and supervision of these important installations.
I repeatedly warned the House of Representatives of extremely serious consequences such as this, if the United States failed to restore military sales and credits to our Turkish allies. I again want to praise those House Members of both parties who voted in the national interest. Now, as a result of yesterday's 223-206 vote in the House of Representatives, Turkey has today announced actions which I believe will work to the detriment of critically important U.S. security interests.
In view of these damaging developments, I urge the House of Representatives to reconsider its refusal to restore the traditional U.S.-Turkish defense relationship. Prompt, affirmative action by the House of Representatives is essential to the vital national defense interests of the United States, our partners in the Eastern Mediterranean, and our allies in the Atlantic Alliance.
