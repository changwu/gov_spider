    The President today announced the appointment of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), comprised of 12 distinguished scientists and engineers. This panel will provide high-level advice directly to the President on a wide range of important issues concerning science and technology.
PCAST will be the first Presidential scientific advisory group in many years to report directly to the President. Its establishment is a measure of the Bush administration's high esteem for science and a recognition that advances in science and technology contribute in a major way to increased economic competitiveness. It also reflects the President's desire to strengthen Federal science and technology policy, enhance Federal research and development activities, and encourage private sector involvement in research and development.
The United States scientific community leads the world in creating new knowledge. Through PCAST, the President is seeking to provide the best obtainable private sector advice to executive branch decisionmaking in science and technology.
PCAST will be chaired by Dr. D. Allan Bromley, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. PCAST was established January 19, 1990, by Executive Order 12700. Its members will be sworn in later today by the Vice President at the White House. They include the following individuals:
