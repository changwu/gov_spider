Administration Actions
The Vice President chairs the Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh serving as vice-chair.
Established in April of 2021, The Task Force is comprised of over 20 participant agencies, offices, and White House components, counting 13 cabinet secretaries as members.
In February 2022, the task force released its 1st report, which included more than 70 actions that the federal government can take to make it easier for workers to organize, such as leveraging federal government purchasing/spending power to support workers who are organizing.
President Biden accepted the recommendations, and as a follow up, the Task Force will submit a second report to the President which will describe progress in implementation and contain additional proposals for further action.
In May 2022, the VP and Sec. Walsh held a roundtable with a diverse group of young, grassroots worker organizers, including Christian Smalls of the Amazon Labor Union and Laura Garza of Starbucks Workers United, to discuss their extraordinary efforts to organize unions in their workplaces.

VP Travel Pool report #5 - excerpts from speach at breakfast
The VP spoke to an enthusiastic audience and several remarks drew loud applause and cheers.
Excerpts from speech

"Let us be clear: Our whole nation benefits from your work. Because when union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. And when unions are strong, America is strong."
"In Congress and in state houses across our nation. Extremist so-called leaders are fighting to turn back the clockâ€¦To a time before workers had the freedom to organize. To a time before women had the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies. To a time before all Americans had the freedom to vote. Today in America, our communities are being terrorized by gun violence. And yet these extremist so-called leaders are fighting to keep assault weapons on the shelves. Today in America, so many working families are struggling to get by. But instead of standing with working people to lower the price of healthcare, education, and childcare. These extremist, so-called leaders prioritize breaks for big corporations and the wealthiest one percent."
"To rebuild our nation's infrastructure, we need you. We need plumbers and pipefitters in Malden and Chelsea to replace the lead pipes in schools and homes. And to help us replace every lead pipe within ten years - which is our goal. We need electrical workers in Northampton and Essex to lay the fiber optic lines that bring high-speed internet to every household in America - during the height of the pandemic it became clear - you want to talk about inequities in the system...And we need the hard-working members of Boston's building trades to build new bus lanes and sidewalks in Roxbury. And to make upgrades to Logan."
"For years, and I have seen this since I was Attorney General of California...and for years, the largest drug companies have made billions of dollars in profits. Selling drugs for ten or a hundred times what they cost to make, you all know what I'm talking about. For years, Big Pharma has tried to grow their profits by preventing Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. For years, so-called leaders supported this injustice. And for years, they got away with it. But we said enough. Last month, our Administration - because of your support - gave Medicare the power to negotiate on behalf of over 60 million people. That's the power of collective bargaining."
"Many promised it before: we did it."
"Just last month the president signed a law that will cap the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 per month"
"Boston knows this: when we fight we win and so we fight knowing there is more work to be done."
"We know what's at stake. We know what we stand for. We know when we fight we win. We love our country so much."
