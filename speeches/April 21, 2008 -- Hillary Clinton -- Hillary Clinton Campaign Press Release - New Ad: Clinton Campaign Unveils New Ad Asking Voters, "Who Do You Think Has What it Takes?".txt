Kitchen:30
It's the toughest job in the world.
You need to be ready for anything - especially now, with two wars, oil prices skyrocketing and an economy in crisis.
Harry Truman said it best - if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Who do you think has what it takes?
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
