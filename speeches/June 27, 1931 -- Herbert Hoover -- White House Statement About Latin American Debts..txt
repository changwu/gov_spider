    THE WHITE HOUSE issued the following statement:
There is absolutely no foundation for the stories circulated in the press to the effect that this Government is considering plans for or discussions concerning South American debts. These remain, as do all private debts, solely a relationship between the debtors and creditors. Our bankers have given aid during the depression to various South American countries and so far as the administration is aware those countries are making every effort fully to maintain their credit and confidence.
