    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised - 1st paragraph) 3/22/85
(House)(Montgomery (D) Mississippi)
The Administration does not object to passage of H.R. 752 in the House. However, it does object to the provision expanding eligibility for educational benefits under the new G.I. bill to those individuals with prior service who return to active duty after a break in service, and will work with the Senate to delete this provision. This expansion of benefits is programmatically unwarranted, potentially costly, and inconsistent with the intent of P.L. 98-525, the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1985. Educational benefits under the new G.I. Bill should be as P.L. 98-525 mandated, limited to first-time enlistees only.
