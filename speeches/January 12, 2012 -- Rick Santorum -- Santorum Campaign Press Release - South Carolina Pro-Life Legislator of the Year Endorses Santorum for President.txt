Mt. Pleasant, SC - Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum has received the endorsement of South Carolina State Representative Greg Delleney.
Representative Delleney said: "Senator Rick Santorum recently was quoted as saying that 'we need someone who has the bold, sharp contrasts, not just to win the election but to govern the country.' I agree with Senator Santorum and that is why I have decided to endorse him as the Republican nominee for President of the United States. Senator Santorum has the experience and knowledge to lead the United States during this critical time in the history of our country. He is a true conservative who shares our traditional values of being pro-life and favors a constitutional ban on same sex marriage. I am honored to endorse and support Rick Santorum for President of the United States."
Rick Santorum said: "Representative Delleney has been an incredible leader for the founding values of our nation in South Carolina, namely the first principle of valuing life. I am honored to receive his endorsement today as we continue to build our campaign's momentum in the First-in-the-South primary state of South Carolina. I look forward toworking with Greg in the coming days as we move toward victory in the Palmetto State."
