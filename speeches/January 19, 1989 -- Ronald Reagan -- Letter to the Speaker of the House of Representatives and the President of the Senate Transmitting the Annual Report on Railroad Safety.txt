    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I transmit herewith the 1987 Annual Report on the Administration of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, (45 U.S.C. 421 et seq.), as required by the Act. As the report indicates, we have achieved considerable success in reducing the number of railroad-related accidents, injuries, and fatalities during this Administration. This report was prepared in accordance with Section 211 of the Act.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
