    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, relating to the claim of Messrs. Sivewright, Bacon & Co., of Manchester, England, British subjects, for compensation for damages sustained by their vessel, the British steamship Eastry , in consequence of collisions, in June, 1901, at Manila, with certain coal hulks belonging to the United States Government.
I recommend that, as an act of equity and comity, provision be made by the Congress for reimbursement to the firm of the money expended by it in making the repairs to the ship which the collisions rendered necessary.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
