    The President today called Octavio Visiedo, superintendent of schools for Dade County, FL, to inform him that $40 million will be immediately available to hard-hit Florida schools. The funds will be used to provide transportation to schools and new portable classrooms and to cover extraordinary operating costs.
Hurricane Andrew destroyed or severely damaged 15 percent of the 297 Dade County schools, creating transportation needs for 40,000 more children than expected. It is anticipated that with the additional assistance all children in Dade County will be able to return to school on September 14.
Other aid to be provided by the Department of Education will help students affected by the disaster. This aid includes: additional Federal grant and loan money to college, university, and trade school students; new funds for supplemental grants and campus-based loans to all institutions that enroll students affected by the disaster; and sensitivity in accommodating students' financial needs in general.
