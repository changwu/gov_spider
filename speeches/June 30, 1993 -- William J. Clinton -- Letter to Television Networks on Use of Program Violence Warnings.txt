    Dear Howard:
I applaud the action taken today by CBS and by the other major broadcast networks to begin addressing the problem of violence on television. Millions of parents are rightly concerned that their children are exposed to far too many graphic pictures of murder and mayhem. The announcement of voluntary violence warnings is an important, commendable first step in dealing with this crucial issue.
For the health of our society and the American family, we must continue to find ways to limit the excessive portrayal of violence in our television programming. In the past, the television industry has responded to public concerns and has dealt in a responsible manner with issues such as drug use, alcohol, and smoking. I encourage the broadcast industry, the creators and producers, as well as the advertisers who support network programming, to take full responsibility in limiting the amount of televised violence.
Again, I commend the networks for this initial effort and encourage you to continue to find ways to make your programming suitable for the children and youth of this nation.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
