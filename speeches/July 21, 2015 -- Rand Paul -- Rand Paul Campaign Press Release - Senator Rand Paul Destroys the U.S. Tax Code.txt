    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Sen.Rand Paul today unveiled his plan for destroying the 70,000-page U.S. Tax Code. His 'Fair and Flat' Tax Plan will be the largest tax cut in American history and will leave roughly $2 trillion in the pockets of hardworking Americans over a 10-year period. The Fair and Flat tax will implement a 14.5 percent flat tax for all individuals and businesses, eliminate FICA tax on American workers, eliminate corporate welfare, and create at least 1.4 million jobs in the first 10 years.
"My Fair and Flat tax plan is the biggest and boldest cut in American history. The only groups that will hate my plan are the lobbyists and big corporations that depend on handouts and special favors from the Washington Machine. This plan is for hardworking families looking to achieve and sustain the American Dream," Sen. Paul said.
