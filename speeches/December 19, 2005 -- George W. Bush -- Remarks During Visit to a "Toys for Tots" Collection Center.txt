    The President. Two-hundred-eighty-nine-thousand toys so far, right——
Volunteer. So far.
The President. ——are being distributed from here to children throughout DC.
It's an interesting process. The toys are collected, the marines sort, the DC police distributes. Is that right?
Volunteer. Yes.
The President. Thanks for doing this. It's a great part of the compassion of our country. Now, I told our troops that, one, we're a great military. We're great because of the men and women who serve. We're great because they're well trained. We're also great because they're decent people who care about a neighbor in need.
So Laura and I are thrilled to be here. Thank you all for your service.
Volunteer. Thank you.
Volunteer. No problem, sir.
The President. Okay, we're getting to work.
