    I send greetings to the participants of the 2003 Great American Cleanup. I am honored to serve as Honorary Chair of this event.
America is a land of majestic beauty, and Americans can be proud of the remarkable progress we have made in protecting our environment and natural resources. Today, our air is cleaner, our waters are less polluted, and our lands are better protected, better managed, and more accessible to the American people. Through volunteer service programs such as the Great American Cleanup, we continue to preserve our natural heritage for future generations and make our communities more vibrant places to visit and live.
I have called on every American to dedicate at least 4,000 hours over the rest of their lives to the service of others. Through the USA Freedom Corps initiative, my Administration is mobilizing individuals and organizations and providing opportunities for citizens to give back to their communities. Americans have responded with an outpouring of acts of kindness and volunteer service that is transforming our Nation, one heart and one soul at a time.
I commend those involved with the Great American Cleanup for answering the call to serve. I also applaud Keep America Beautiful for 50 years of encouraging Americans to take responsibility for improving the environment.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes.
