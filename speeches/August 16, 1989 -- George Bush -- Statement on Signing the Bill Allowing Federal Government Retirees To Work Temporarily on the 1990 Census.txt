    I am pleased to sign into law today H.R. 1860, a bill that will help assure that we have the best possible people conducting the 1990 census. The bill allows government retirees to work temporarily on the census without having their pension benefits reduced. With this change in the law, the Census Bureau adds two million qualified people to the pool of possible temporary employees for the 1990 census.
These former public servants bring with them a wealth of experience that will make them effective census workers. They will also bring to these jobs a demonstrated commitment to public service, based on their long careers in government. They are people who understand and respect the public trust and will serve us well in helping to carry out this most important undertaking. This law makes sense and is good public policy. It allows us to use the best people we can find to help us with the 1990 census, an activity that is at the heart of our constitutional democracy.
