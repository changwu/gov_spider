    McLean, VA - Fred Thompson today issued the follow statement on Judge Mukasey, President Bush's nominee for Attorney General:
"The President appears to have nominated someone whose career experience qualifies him to serve as Attorney General. I hope that Senate Democrats will move promptly on Judge Mukasey's nomination, as the Department of Justice needs a Senate-confirmed leader to address the significant challenges we face as a nation. Judge Mukasey will need to prove himself an Attorney General with a firm commitment to confronting the global terrorist threat, both here and abroad, while also ensuring the protection of our basic liberties. His recent op-ed on the subject in The Wall Street Journal is a good sign that he has that commitment. I also hope that as soon a s he is confirmed he will take a fresh look at whether the FBI has successfully transformed itself to focus on preventing rather than responding to terrorist attacks."
