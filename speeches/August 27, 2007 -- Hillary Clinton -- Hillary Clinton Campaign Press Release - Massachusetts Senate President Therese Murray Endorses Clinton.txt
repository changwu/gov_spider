    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Massachusetts Senate President Therese Murray, reflecting Hillary's growing support in the Bay State.
"At this point in our nation's history, we need a leader in the White House, and no one is more qualified for that challenge than Hillary Clinton," Senate President Murray said. "Hillary Clinton understands the needs and struggles of all Americans and will work to restore our commitment to domestic issues while mending our international relationships."
Murray is the first woman elected as President of the Massachusetts Senate, and had formerly chaired the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Currently serving her eighth term, President Murray was first elected to the Senate in 1992 to represent Plymouth and Barnstable. Throughout her career, Murray has been a tireless advocate for affordable, quality health care, serving as one of the six legislators to negotiate the compromise that lead to Massachusetts' historic health care reform law. Murray has also been an unwavering voice for improving public education from pre-kindergarten through college, increasing economic and workforce development opportunities, and expanding affordable housing.
"I'm honored to have President Murray's support," Clinton said. "She has broken new ground in Massachusetts and has been instrumental in helping pass health care coverage for all Bay Staters."
Clinton has received strong support in Massachusetts, winning the endorsements of Congressmen Jim McGovern and Richard Neal, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral, Boston City Council President Maureen Feeney and 30 Massachusetts state legislators. This group of leaders will help spread Hillary Clinton's message for change throughout their communities and also support her campaign's efforts in New Hampshire, an important early primary state.
