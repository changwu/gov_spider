    The President. It is my honor to welcome the newest Member of the United States Congress to the Oval Office. Randy Forbes ran a great race. He won a race a lot of folks didn't think he could win. And he did it because he talked about issues that mattered to the people of Virginia: tax relief, Social Security reform, strong national defense.
We all knew he was a good candidate. We didn't realize how good until the results came in last night. So it's an honor for the Vice President and me, the chairman of the party, Congressman Davis, to welcome you both to the Oval Office and congratulate you and look forward to working with you.
Representative Forbes. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And it's an exciting victory for us, and we couldn't have done it without the help from you, Mr. President, and the Vice President, and also the great chairman of our party and chairman of the congressional committee. They all just put so many resources together and made this victory possible.
The President. Congratulations.
Representative Forbes. Thank you.
The President. Thank you all.
