  A Proclamation

The Nation's most basic resources are the food and fiber produced on American farms. As these supplies are used, they are renewed each growing season. Without food and fiber, all else would cease.
The production of our food and fiber is the most common example of the use of solar energy. Plants, through interaction with the sun's rays, capture solar energy and package it in the usable form of food and fiber.
These actions are so taken for granted that we may overlook the phenomena of interdependence between sun and plants that is so basic to our well-being. Without plants, the earth would be a barren planet, incapable of sustaining life; and without energy from the sun, the earth would be an uninhabitable globe whirling in space.
We may also take our national food and fiber abundance so much for granted that we overlook the interdependence of farms, which produce our food and fiber, and cities, which process the food and fiber and distribute it within easy reach of each of us. Without farms, cities would be barren monuments of concrete, and without cities, farms would be primitive forms of economic life.
To achieve a better appreciation of the contributions and cooperation of farms and cities, the Nation has set aside a week in November as National Farm-City Week. The theme is "Farm and City, Partners in Progress?Key to the Future."
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 21 through November 27, 1980, as National Farm-City Week.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.

JIMMY CARTER
