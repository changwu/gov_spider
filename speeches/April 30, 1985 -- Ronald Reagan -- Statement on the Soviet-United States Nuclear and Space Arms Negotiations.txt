    I have just met with our three senior negotiators in the Geneva talks. Ambassadors Kampelman, Tower, and Glitman briefed me on developments in the first round which has just ended. We also had an initial discussion of our preparations for the next round.
These negotiations are among the most complicated and difficult ever undertaken, and it is clear that they will take time. But we find ourselves in the best position to achieve meaningful arms limitations that has existed in a generation. With patience, strength, and Western solidarity, we will succeed.
My administration is committed to achieving verifiable and equitable agreements substantially reducing U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals. This is one of the most important and urgent tasks facing the international community, and we will not waver in our determination to achieve this goal. With our skilled and dedicated negotiating team we are doing our part, and, as long as the Soviet Union is similarly committed, there are grounds for optimism that agreement can be reached.
I am leaving later today for Europe, where I will take part in the economic summit in Bonn and meet with some of our allied leaders both there and in bilateral visits to Germany, Spain, and Portugal. In addition to the major economic issues which are on the summit agenda, my private discussions with these allied leaders will also cover security issues, including developments in Geneva. Our commitment, and that of our friends and allies, to our twin goals of peace and prosperity remains steadfast.
