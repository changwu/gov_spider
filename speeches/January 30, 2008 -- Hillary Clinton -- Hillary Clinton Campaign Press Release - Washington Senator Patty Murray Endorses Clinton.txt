    Washington's senior Senator Patty Murray announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton today.
"Hillary and I both came to Washington together in 1993, and since that time she hasn't stopped working on the priorities that matter most to America's families," Murray said.
"Together we have partnered to pass strong port security legislation, stand up to an Administration that put ideology above science, and provide the care that our nation's veterans have earned. She understands the challenges that face us here in Washington state from security at our Northern Border to cleaning up Hanford. Hillary is ready to lead this nation from her first day in office and deliver the change we need."
Senator Murray serves in the Democratic leadership as Democratic Conference Secretary, and is the highest ranking woman in the Senate.
"I am proud of the work Patty and I have done together in the Senate and I'm honored to have her support," Clinton said. "With her help, we're going to bring our message of change to voters across Washington."
Sens. Murray and Clinton worked together to pass the Safe Ports Act, America's first comprehensive port security regime and to stand up to the Bush Administration when the FDA continued to drag its feet in issuing a decision on whether to make safe emergency contraceptives available for over-the-counter purchase. They have also worked together to improve care for America's foster children and to make the dream of a college education more accessible to all students.
In addition to her Leadership role, Murray is a member of the Appropriations Committee - of which she chairs the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee, the Veterans Affairs Committee, the Budget Committee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.
Senator Murray is the 12th U.S. Senator to endorse Hillary Clinton.
