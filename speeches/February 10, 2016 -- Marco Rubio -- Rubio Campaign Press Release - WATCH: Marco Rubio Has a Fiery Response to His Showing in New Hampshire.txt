Despite a rocky few days for which he's taken responsibility, he's going to win the Republican nomination, and he's going to win the general election.

How's he feeling right now?
Our team here [in NH] did a great job. To the extent that we finished shorter than we wanted to, I think it had to do with the fact that Saturday night and the last three days and the coverage. So that's on me. That ain't ever going to happen again. We're looking forward to South Carolina. We're headed there right now. We're getting back on the road here. We're going to win this campaign. We're going to win this primary. It's important for the country and I'm fired up about that.
What's one reason he's the best candidate?
This line that somehow I have no experience is absurd. It's true I haven't lived as long as some people running for president, but I have more foreign policy experience than any of them — a lot more. And that's the most important job of a president. The most important job of a president is to be the commander in chief and to keep us safe.
Is anything going to change about the campaign?
Looking forward, we're going to talk about the future. Which is what all elections are about, but never more so than right now.
One of the things I'm criticized for is saying the truth, and I'll continue to say this: Barack Obama is undermining this country . . . in a way I believe is part of a plan to weaken America on the global stage.
The differences between Republicans and Democrats are not small — they are massive. And this election is about that difference, and ensuring we choose the right road.
Marco's moving on to South Carolina — get fired up!
