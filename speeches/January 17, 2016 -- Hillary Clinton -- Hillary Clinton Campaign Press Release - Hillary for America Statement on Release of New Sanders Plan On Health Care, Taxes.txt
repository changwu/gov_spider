    Following Senator Bernie Sanders' harried release of a new proposal on health care and taxes just ahead of Sunday evening's Democratic debate, Hillary for America spokesman Brian Fallon released the following statement:
"Senator Sanders has been changing a lot of positions in the last 24 hours because when his plans and record come under scrutiny, their very real flaws get exposed. After digging in his heels for weeks, he backpedaled on his vote to give sweeping immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers. And after weeks of denying the legitimacy of the questions Hillary Clinton raised about flaws in the health care legislation he's introduced 9 times over 20 years, he proposed a new plan two hours before the debate. Hillary Clinton knows what it takes, and has what it takes, to protect the gains of the Affordable Care Act and secure quality, affordable health care for all Americans. When you're running for President and you're serious about getting results for the American people, details matter—and Senator Sanders is making them up as he goes along."
