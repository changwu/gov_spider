    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Weiss (D) New York and 85 others)
The President's senior advisers will recommend a veto of H.R. 1400 if it is presented for the President's action. In the current fiscal environment, it is important that Federal funds be used to support national needs and priorities, not non-essential programs, such as General Revenue Sharing. The President's 1987 Budget assumes termination of General Revenue Sharing.
