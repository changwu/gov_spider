    Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was not only an eloquent spokesman for the American civil rights movement, and for human rights everywhere. He went the difficult second mile and took the risk of living what he believed, of facing the snarling dogs and men with clubs and firehoses armed only with the spirit of freedom and love. Looking squarely in the eye of hatred and fear he retained his "abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind."
He warned us of the evils of the racism he endured each day, but also of- the unseen threat of nuclear destruction, reminding us always that the God he served had something better for us if we would but listen. "Unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality," he assured us. "Right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant."
On this 52d anniversary of his birth, when containing the dangers of nuclear weapons and securing the fundamental human rights of people throughout the world are still unmet goals, we all need his message of nonviolence, of love in action. I commend the efforts of Coretta Scott King to continue his work through the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Social Change.
As we honor his memory this year, may we as a nation at last take hold of the treasured birthright he sought to hand down to usâ€”of brotherhood and freedom, peace and love for all people.
