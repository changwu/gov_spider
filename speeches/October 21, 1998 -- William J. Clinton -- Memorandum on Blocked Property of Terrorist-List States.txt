    Presidential Determination No. 99-1
Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury
Subject: Determination to Waive Requirements Relating to Blocked Property of Terrorist-List States
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, as contained in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (approved October 21, 1998), I hereby determine that the requirements of section 117, including the requirement that any property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated pursuant to section 5(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5(b)), section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2370(a)), sections 202 and 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1702), and proclamations, orders, regulations, and licenses issued pursuant thereto, be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution of any judgment relating to a claim for which a foreign state claiming such property is not immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code, would impede the ability of the President to conduct foreign policy in the interest of national security and would, in particular, impede the effectiveness of such prohibitions and regulations upon financial transactions, and, therefore, pursuant to section 117(d), I hereby waive the requirements of section 117 in the interest of national security.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
