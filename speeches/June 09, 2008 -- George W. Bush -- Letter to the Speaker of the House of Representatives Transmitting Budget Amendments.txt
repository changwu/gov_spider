    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 Budget requests for the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Labor, Transportation, and the Treasury; as well as the Corps of Engineers, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management. These amendments will decrease by $3 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2009 Budget.
These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies proposed in my FY 2009 Budget. The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
