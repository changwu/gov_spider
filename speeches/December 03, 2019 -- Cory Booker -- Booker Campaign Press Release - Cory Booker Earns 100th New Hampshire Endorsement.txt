Manchester, NH â€” Cory Booker today earned his 100th New Hampshire endorsement as ten activists from across the Granite State declared their support for Booker for president.
"We're thrilled to hit this milestone and continue to grow Cory's support in New Hampshire," said Erin Turmelle, Cory for New Hampshire state director. "We are grateful for the enthusiastic support Cory has received from New Hampshire leaders over the course of many months. These elected officials, activists and community leaders are influential voices in their communities who are growing our grassroots campaign and will make the difference heading into February 11."
"I'm endorsing Cory Booker because he is the only candidate who can bring together this country and inspire voters who sat out in 2016 to vote in the general election so that we can beat Donald Trump," said Nikki Arguin, a Nashua activist. "Cory has experience building coalitions to get results. He's a unique leader who our country needs right now in the White House so we can fix the damage of the Trump presidency and make progress on climate change, health care, income inequality and so much more."
