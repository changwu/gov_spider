    Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of King Abdullah. We extend our sympathies to his family in their moment of loss.
King Abdullah's death is a great loss for his country. It is hard to distinguish him from Saudi Arabia itself. Over many decades, he played an outsized role in building his country.
Over the years, I have come to know King Abdullah. I always appreciated his frankness, his sense of history, his pride in his efforts to move his country forward, and his steadfast belief in the U.S.-Saudi relationship.
In the coming days, I will be leading a Presidential delegation representing the United States to pay our respects and offer condolences to King Abdullah's family and nation.
