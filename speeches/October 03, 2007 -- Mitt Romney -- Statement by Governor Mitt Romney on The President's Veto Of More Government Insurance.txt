Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding the President's veto of the SCHIP legislation:
"I agree with the President that this legislation – while well intentioned – took the wrong approach. The Democrat SCHIP expansion bill would take children out of private insurance and put them into government insurance. It was a flawed approach. The right course is to get all children and all citizens insured with private, market-based health insurance."
