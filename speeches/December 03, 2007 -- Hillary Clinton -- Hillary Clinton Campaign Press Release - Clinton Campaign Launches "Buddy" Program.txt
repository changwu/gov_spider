    Effort to Drive 20,000 Iowans to Caucus for Hillary
DES MOINES, IA - In events across Iowa today, Hillary Clinton launched her "buddy" program, an effort to pair 20,000 Iowans to caucus for her on January 3rd. Senator Clinton launched the program in Cedar Rapids followed by a "Take Your Buddy to Caucus" event with former Majority Leader and retired Missouri Congressman Richard Gephardt in Bettendorf, IA.
"Iowans are clearly ready for change," said Clinton Iowa State Director Teresa Vilmain. "But if they want a President with the strength and experience to turn around our disastrous foreign policy, to deliver universal health care, and to fight for the middle class, they need to start by caucusing for her. Our buddy program will help bring new caucus goers out for Hillary Clinton on January 3rd."
The goal of the "buddy" program is threefold: to pair first time caucus goers with experienced caucus goers, to pair first time caucus goers with one another, and to get 20,000 people to caucus on behalf of Hillary Clinton through this program. Buddies will provide support to each other in the weeks leading up to the election by meeting or speaking via phone to create a plan for the night of the caucus.
Senator Clinton's "buddy" program was launched via an e-mail from legendary performer Barbra Streisand on Wednesday, November 28. A special mail piece has been sent to supporters of Senator Clinton across Iowa.
