    Last January, President Bush called on Congress to reduce our nation's consumption of gasoline by 20 percent in 10 years by modernizing CAFE standards and greatly expanding the use of alternative fuels. We congratulate the United States Senate for their effort to address the challenge of the President's bold "20 in 10" initiative. The Senate energy plan will update CAFE standards and enhance the use of renewable fuels. By addressing the concerns of the Administration and moving forward with a bipartisan approach, senators have taken steps to improve our economic and energy security. If this legislation makes it to the President's desk, he will sign it into law.
