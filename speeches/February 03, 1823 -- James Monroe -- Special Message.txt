    To the Senate of the United States:
Having lately received a memorial from the legislative council of the Territory of Florida on subjects very interesting to the inhabitants of the Territory and also to the United States, which require legislative provision, I transmit the same to Congress and recommend it to their consideration.
JAMES MONROE.
(The same message was addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.)
