    I am pleased to be signing into law today S. 1181, the Uniformed Services Pay Act of 1981. The legislation will provide to all of our men and women in uniform a richly deserved average increase of 14.3 percent in basic pay, basic allowance for quarters, and basic allowance for subsistence. The bill also contains increases in a number of special and incentive pays which are designed to attract and retain those highly skilled personnel who are so vital to the efficient operation of our Armed Forces.
Attracting and retaining well-motivated, high quality military personnel is a critical element of my commitment to strengthen America's defenses. This bill will enable us to do that. For too long our dedicated military personnel have been undercompensated for the sacrifices and family disruptions they have had to endure in protecting the freedom of all of us.
I am particularly pleased that this legislation received such strong bipartisan support in the Congress. In that regard, I want to personally thank Senators Roger Jepsen and James Exon and Congressmen Bill Nichols and Donald Mitchell for their hard work and skill in guiding this bill through the Congress.
