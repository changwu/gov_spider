    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Castle (R) DE and 16 cosponsors)
The Administration is strongly committed to ensuring that all students, including career and technical education (CTE) students at the high school and community college levels, graduate with the academic knowledge and skills they need to successfully enter the workforce or pursue a postsecondary education. The Administration did not propose reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act because, despite decades of significant Federal spending, the current program is not adequately preparing our students to participate in today's competitive workforce. The Administration believes that vocational-education students will be better able to compete in a changing economy if Federal programs ensure accountability and incorporate rigorous academic standards.
If Congress chooses to reauthorize the program, the Administration urges Congress to make changes in conference that would ensure accountability for Federal funds and ensure that Federal funds are directed to activities that will (1) improve student achievement and graduation rates for all CTE students and (2) improve job prospects, degree or certificate attainment, and earnings for postsecondary students.
