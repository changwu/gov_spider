(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 152, making appropriations for disaster relief for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, if amended to provide the necessary resources to continue ongoing response and recovery efforts for Hurricane Sandy, while helping impacted communities effectively mitigate future risk of disaster to prevent losses of this magnitude from recurring. Given the emergency and one-time nature of this supplemental appropriation, and in keeping with the response to Hurricane Katrina, Deepwater Horizon, and other disasters, the Administration believes that all funding in the bill should be designated as an emergency requirement and not be offset.
Providing Federal funding for response, recovery, and mitigation following Hurricane Sandy will maintain the Nation's tradition of pulling together to help one another in times of greatest need. The Administration urges the Congress to pass a bill as soon as possible to give affected States and communities the support they need to recover and rebuild.
