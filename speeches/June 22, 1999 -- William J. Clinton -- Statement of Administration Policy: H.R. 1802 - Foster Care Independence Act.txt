    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Reps. Johnson (R) CT and Cardin (D) MD)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1802, which would assist young adults who are leaving our Nation's foster care system in making the successful transition to independent living. Similar to the proposal in the President's FY 2000 Budget, H.R. 1802 would provide those leaving foster care with access to health care and would expand and improve educational opportunities, training, housing assistance, counseling, and other support and services for these youth. The Administration is pleased that the bill includes several Administration proposals to improve the integrity of the Social Security disability programs as well as its proposal to amend the child support enforcement statute to eliminate the unintended windfall for States receiving hold harmless payments.
The Administration supports the goal of providing assistance to World War II Filipino veterans who wish to return to their native country. The Administration, however, has concerns about providing such assistance through the Supplemental Security Income program. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to enact an alternative to address this goal.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1802 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget's preliminary scoring estimate indicates that H.R. 1802 would reduce direct spending in FY 2000 by $56 million and by a total of $43 million during FYS 2000-2004.
