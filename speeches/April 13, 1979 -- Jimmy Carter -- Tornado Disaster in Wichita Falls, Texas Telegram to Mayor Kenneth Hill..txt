    Jack Watson of my staff is en route to Wichita Falls as my personal representative to assure that all appropriate and necessary federal assistance is being made available.
Mr. Watson has the authority to ensure that the federal government's response to this tragedy is timely and of maximum assistance to the people of the area, and he will report to me upon his return to Washington.
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your fellow citizens.
JIMMY CARTER
