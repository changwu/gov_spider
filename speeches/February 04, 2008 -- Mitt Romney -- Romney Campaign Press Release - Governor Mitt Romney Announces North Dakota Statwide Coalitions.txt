Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the North Dakota Veterans for Mitt, North Dakota Women for Mitt, North Dakota Agriculture for Mitt, and his North Dakota Faith and Values Chairman.
Following the addition of former Tax Commissioner Rick Clayburgh and Rep. Don Dietrich yesterday, these coalition leaders join a strong and growing Romney for President team in North Dakota that includes a 44 member North Dakota Statewide Steering Committee.
Announcing the coalition leaders, Governor Romney said, 'Almost three decades ago, Ronald Reagan united social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, and national security conservatives to forge the Republican Party that we know today. I am proud that these North Dakota leaders represent each part of the Reagan Coalition because that coalition is what has kept the White House in Republican hands for 20 of the last 28 years. To win in November, we must stay true to President Reagan's vision, and I am the only candidate that can unite fiscal, social, and national security conservatives to lead us to victory over the Democrat nominee.'
