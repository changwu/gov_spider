    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1335, the "Emergency Supplemental Appropriations" Act of 1993. This Act provides $4 billion in emergency unemployment compensation to approximately 1.9 million unemployed American workers. This critical assistance will help the unemployed and their families with grocery bills, mortgage payments and other expenses while they seek new employment. I am disappointed that the job-producing elements of the original version of the legislation were forced to be removed from it.
Our efforts to create jobs, increase investment, and safeguard our communities and our children, were frustrated by the use of parliamentary tactics in the Senate in the furtherance of politics-as-usual. The losers, in the end, were jobless Americans looking for the dignity of employment, and communities across the United States looking forward to meeting unmet national needs through growth-oriented efforts provided by the legislation in its original form. It is my hope that the Congress will consider further legislation to produce the jobs that are needed to strengthen and sustain the current economic recovery.
