PAUL RYAN: "[W]e're the ones offering a plan to save Medicare; to protect Medicare; to strengthen Medicare. We are the ones who are not raiding Medicare to pay for Obamacare. We're the ones who are repealing President Obama's 15 person bureaucratic board that will put price controls on Medicare that will lead to denied care for current seniors. We're the ones continuing the guarantee of Medicare for people in or near retirement. And you have to reform it for the younger generation, in order to make the commitment stick for the current generation. President Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors. It's irrefutable. And that's why I think this is a debate we want to have and that's a debate we're going to win."
