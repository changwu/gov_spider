    Based on the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) assessment, President Donald J. Trump signed a proclamation today announcing that the Republic of Chad has improved its identity-management and information sharing practices sufficiently to meet the baseline security standard of the United States. Chad nationals will therefore again be able to receive visas for travel to the United States.
Today's decision is based on DHS's required 180-day review of entry restrictions imposed by Proclamation 9645 on nationals of eight countries. The review was based on the enhanced global security measures that DHS and the Department of State established, the first ever set of minimum requirements for international cooperation in support of our visa and immigration vetting and adjudications. Presidential Proclamation 9645 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to recommend whether the entry restrictions should be continued, modified, terminated, or supplemented, based on a review that accounts for whether countries have improved their identity-management and information-sharing protocols and procedures.
The President's first priority is the safety and security of the American people. The tailored travel restrictions imposed by Proclamation 9645, and reaffirmed by today's proclamation the President today, will keep our country safe and encourage countries to meet our baseline requirements. These travel restrictions help prevent potential terrorists and criminals from reaching our shores and encourage foreign governments to live up to their obligations to enhance security and share essential information with the United States. By lifting travel restrictions on nationals of Chad, the United States is demonstrating that the criteria set forth in Proclamation 9645 can and do work to enhance the security of the United States.
