    WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Today, President Donald J. Trump issued two proclamations authorizing modifications of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Administration has reached a final agreement with South Korea on steel imports, the outlines of which were previously announced by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Republic of Korea Minister for Trade Hyun-chong Kim. The Administration has also reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminum, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days. In all of these negotiations, the Administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security.
These agreements underscore the Trump Administration's successful strategy to reach fair outcomes with allies to protect our national security and address global challenges to the steel and aluminum industries.
