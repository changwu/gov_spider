    WASHINGTON â€“ With a progressive vision for America that is the future of the Democratic Party, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Thursday that an energized base of working people and young voters will propel him to victory over Hillary Clinton.
A string of polls which show Sanders faring better than Clinton against Republican White House hopefuls also provides solid evidence that Sanders would be the strongest general election candidate to defeat front-runner Donald Trump or other Republicans.
"The future of the Democratic Party must be tied to a strong progressive movement which is prepared to create a government representing all Americans, not just the billionaire class," Sanders said.
"I am proud that our campaign has created a level of excitement and energy not seen elsewhere and that poll after poll shows us that younger people are supporting our efforts. I believe that the excitement we are generating will result in high voter turnout and carry us to victory not only over Secretary Clinton but over Donald Trump or any other Republican candidate," the senator added.
A New York Times/CBS News poll released on Thursday found that Sanders performs better with voters under 45. Clinton leads among voters over age 45.
A new survey by the Harvard Institute of Politics of 18- to 29-year-olds who expect to vote in Democratic primaries and caucuses found that 41 percent favored Sanders compared to just 35 percent for Clinton.
"Our campaign is the campaign for real change, which is what the American people want," Sanders said.
