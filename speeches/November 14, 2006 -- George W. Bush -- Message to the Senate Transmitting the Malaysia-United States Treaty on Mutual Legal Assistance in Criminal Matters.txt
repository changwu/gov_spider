    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States of America and Malaysia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed on July 28, 2006, at Kuala Lumpur. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should enhance our ability to investigate and prosecute a wide variety of crimes. The Treaty is self-executing.
The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Under the Treaty, the Parties agree to assist each other by, among other things: providing evidence (such as testimony, documents, items, or things) obtained voluntarily or, where necessary, by compulsion; arranging for persons, including persons in custody, to travel to the other country to provide evidence; serving documents; executing searches and seizures; locating and identifying persons, items, or places; examining objects and sites; freezing and forfeiting assets or property; and identifying or tracing proceeds of crime.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
