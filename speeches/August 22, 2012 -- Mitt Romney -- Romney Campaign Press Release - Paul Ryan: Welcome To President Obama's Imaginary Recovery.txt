PAUL RYAN: "There's this guy I've known for a number of years—I am going to be talking to him in mid-October—his name is Joe Biden. You might have heard of him. He just said, that the middle class is coming back. We got 23 million people out of work, struggling to find work today. Unemployment has been above 8 percent for 42 straight months and the real unemployment rate's more like 15 percent. He said last summer was going to be the 'Summer of Recovery.' It's a summer later and it's still worse. They said that the private sector is doing just fine. We need more government. This is President Obama's imaginary recovery. It's not here. We have a mountain of uncertainty that is plaguing small businesses. And we have a person, in Mitt Romney, who knows through experience, the challenges that businesses face; how jobs creation works, that the engine of opportunity, the nucleus of our economy is not the government, but the success of small businesses, the entrepreneurs, the people of this country. That's what makes the American Dream spread and grow for everybody."
