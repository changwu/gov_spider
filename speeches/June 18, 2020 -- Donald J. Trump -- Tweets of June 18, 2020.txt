Wacko John Bolton's "exceedingly tedious"(New York Times) book is made up of lies & fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him. A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized & happily dumped. What a dope!Retweets: 33141Favorites: 148570

Bolton's book, which is getting terrible reviews, is a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad. Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!Retweets: 29382Favorites: 129356

When Wacko John Bolton went on Deface the Nation and so stupidly said that he looked at the "Libyan Model" for North Korea, all hell broke out. Kim Jong Un, who we were getting along with very well, went "ballistic", just like his missiles - and rightfully so....Retweets: 18912Favorites: 77634

....He didn't want Bolton anywhere near him. Bolton's dumbest of all statements set us back very badly with North Korea, even now. I asked him, "what the hell were you thinking?" He had no answer and just apologized. That was early on, I should have fired him right then & there!Retweets: 13849Favorites: 59446

These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.

The DACA decision, while a highly political one, and seemingly not based on the law, gives the President of the United States far more power than EVER anticipated. Nevertheless, I will only act in the best interests of the United States of America!Retweets: 22862Favorites: 88910

As President of the United States, I am asking for a legal solution on DACA, not a political one, consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one, so now we have to start this process all over again.Retweets: 34208Favorites: 141424
