    The President today announced that he will amend his September 12, 1992, declaration of a major disaster in the State of Hawaii where permitted to do so by law. He will waive State and local cost sharing requirements and allow reimbursement of 100 percent of eligible public assistance costs exceeding $10 per capita.
The additional relief to be provided by the President is consistent with a request made by Governor John Waihee. It will be granted in response to the extraordinary damage and destruction caused by Hurricane Iniki. By waiving customary State and local cost sharing requirements, the President will provide maximum Federal assistance to the people of Hawaii whose lives have been so severely disrupted by this disaster.
This waiver will apply to all authorized public assistance under the law. It will provide additional help to the State in its efforts to remove debris from the disaster areas, eliminate immediate threats to public health and safety, and carry out emergency work to save lives. Assistance for temporary housing, crisis counseling, and disaster unemployment will continue to be 100 percent federally funded where allowed under the law.
