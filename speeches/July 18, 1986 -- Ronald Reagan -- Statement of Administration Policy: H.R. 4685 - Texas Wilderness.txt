    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Wilson (D) Texas and 2 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4685. While a few of the boundary changes the bill would make to the five existing wildernesses in Texas would improve management of these areas, the vast majority of the boundary changes are undesirable. The bill would add over 1800 acres of land to the wilderness areas, including nearly 700 acres of private land. This would lead to substantial pressure to acquire this land, either by purchase or exchange. Since this land is not needed for preservation of the wilderness values of the existing wildernesses, such acquisition would be wasteful and cannot be justified. Managing wilderness areas containing private lands is also difficult and should be avoided. Accordingly, this land should not be added to the Wilderness System.
