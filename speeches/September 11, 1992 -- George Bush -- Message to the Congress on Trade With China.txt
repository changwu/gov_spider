    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101 - 246), and section 608(a) of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (Public Law 102 - 140), I hereby report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the restrictions contained in those acts on the export to the People's Republic of China of U.S.-origin satellites and Munitions List articles insofar as such restrictions pertain to the APSAT, Asiasat 2, Intelsat VIIA, STARSAT, AfriSat, and Dong Fang Hong 3 projects.
Attached is my justification for the aforesaid actions.
