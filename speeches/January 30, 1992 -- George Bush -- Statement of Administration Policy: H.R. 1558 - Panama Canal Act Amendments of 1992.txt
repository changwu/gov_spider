    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 1/31/92)(House)(Fields (D) Texas)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1558. Concerned agencies are currently reviewing options for changing the management structure of the Panama Canal Commission. Until their review is completed and recommendations are submitted, legislation to change the Commission's structure would be premature.
