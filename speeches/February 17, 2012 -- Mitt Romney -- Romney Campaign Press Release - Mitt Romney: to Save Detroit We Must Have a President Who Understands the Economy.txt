MITT ROMNEY: "The best thing Detroit can do is to get a new president, to get somebody who understands what it takes to get an economy going. It breaks my heart to go through Detroit. The home that I came home to just after being born in Harper Hospital in Palmer Park is bulldozed now because I guess it became a blighted eyesore. It just kills you to see what's happened to the homes and the families in Detroit. And we've got to get the economy going again and unfortunately everything the President has done has made it harder for this economy to get going again. It's now been 36 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. And this is a president who said it would never get above 8 percent if we gave him his economic ahead and we did. We let him put in place his $787 billion stimulus and look what's happened: Detroit is still suffering."
