    Mitt Romney today announced that Congressman Cynthia Lummis will be Chairman of his Wyoming campaign.
"Congressman Lummis has served Wyoming well for the past 30 years and I am honored to have such a public servant leading my campaign in Wyoming," said Mitt Romney.
"Governor Romney's experience as both a chief executive and conservative businessman makes him highly qualified to lead our nation at this time â€“ a time when the size and scope of the federal government threatens to overwhelm us," said Lummis.
"Recently, he highlighted the spending mess that we are in and how we can avert an economic crisis. The burdens now placed on small businesses and working Americans, and those who want to work, seem unbearable. I believe Mitt has emerged as the right person at the right time to lead America. I am honored to serve as his Wyoming Chairman and look forward to bringing his conservative message of fiscal responsibility to voters in my state."
