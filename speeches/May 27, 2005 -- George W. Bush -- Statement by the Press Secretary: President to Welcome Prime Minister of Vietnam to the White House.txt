    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Phan Van Khai of Vietnam to the White House on June 21. The visit marks the tenth anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties in 1995 between the United States and Vietnam. Prime Minister Khai will be the most senior Vietnamese official to visit Washington since that time. The two leaders will discuss ways to further strengthen cooperation on a range of bilateral, regional and international issues. This meeting is particularly timely in light of Vietnam's hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in 2006.
