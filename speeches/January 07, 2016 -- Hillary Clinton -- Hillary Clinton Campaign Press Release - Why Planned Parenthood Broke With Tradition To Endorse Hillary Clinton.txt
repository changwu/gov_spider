For the first time in Planned Parenthood's 100-year history, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund is endorsing a presidential candidate during the primary.

The endorsement comes at a critical time for women's health.

GOP candidates want to erase decades of progress for women: health insurance, birth control, abortion. We need her. In the White House.— Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) January 7, 2016

Just yesterday, Republicans in the House and the Senate voted to defund Planned Parenthood.

Yesterday was a preview of what would happen under a Republican president. Every single GOP candidate would defund Planned Parenthood. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 7, 2016

We can't afford for a Republican to win this election.

Planned Parenthood knows that Hillary Clinton will protect and defend women's health care and reproductive rights.

Every Democrat in the race would be good for women — but @HillaryClinton stands well above the rest. https://t.co/XN6z7Ti7CO #PPact4Hillary— Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 7, 2016

Hillary has fought for women's health, rights, and opportunity throughout her career ...

.@HillaryClinton understands the lives of women & has been fighting for them her entire life.— Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) January 7, 2016

... she's always proud to #StandWithPP ...

Hillary has always stood with Planned Parenthood—and always will. #StandWithPP #solidarity https://t.co/z2yL83BuPV— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) December 5, 2015

... and she'll continue defending reproductive freedom as president.

I'll take on Republicans or anyone who tries to interfere with women's health. Proud to have @PPact's support in this important election. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 7, 2016

Planned Parenthood is ready to help Hillary get to the White House.

.@CecileRichards Completely appropriate. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 7, 2016
