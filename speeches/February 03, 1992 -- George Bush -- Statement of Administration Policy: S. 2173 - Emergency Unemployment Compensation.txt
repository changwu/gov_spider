    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 2/4/92)(Senate)(Bentsen (D) TX)
The Administration strongly supports immediate enactment of S. 2173. The bill would amend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 to provide 13 additional weeks of unemployment benefits., This would raise the total weeks of extended benefits available to jobless Americans to 26 or 33 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate in their State. S. 2173 also meets the important criterion of being fully financed as required by the Budget Enforcement Act.
