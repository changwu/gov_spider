    Mr. President, Mrs. Marcos, our dear friends here in the Philippines:
No words can express the deep gratitude and great appreciation that Mrs. Ford and I have had for the opportunity of visiting your very beautiful country and meeting your just superb people.
To you and to all the Philippine people, my deepest thanks for the exceptional, unbelievable hospitality which made our visit here truly memorable. The frank and very cordial discussions that we have had here, Mr. President, have convinced me of the unshakable bonds between our two countries in the search for a better world for our children and our children's children.
In the past 24 hours, Mr. President, we have discussed a great variety of subjects. We talked in particular about the economic relationship between our two countries and our alliance and our security arrangements.
As befits two old and battle-tested allies, these talks have been very frank and very penetrating. I thank you for the keen insight you have given me into your country's hopes and great aspirations.
Our conversations convinced me of the depth of understanding between the United States and the Philippines, which will permit points on which we may differ to be resolved without becoming items of major conflict.
As I leave today, I go home convinced that the relationship of mutual respect and mutual trust between our two countries is the continuing basis for a true alliance today as well as in the future.
On behalf of Mrs. Ford, our daughter Susan, and all of our delegation--yes, all of the American people--I thank you and Mrs. Marcos and all of the people of the Philippines for the gracious, the kind, and the wonderful reception that we had. We are most appreciative.
