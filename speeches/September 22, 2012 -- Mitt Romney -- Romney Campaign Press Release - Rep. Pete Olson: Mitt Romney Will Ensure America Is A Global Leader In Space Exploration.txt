    Texas Congressman Pete Olson released the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for Securing U.S. Leadership in Space:Â 
"America's human space exploration program propelled the United States to global dominance resulting in ground-breaking achievements in science, technology and medicine. Under President Obama's failed leadership, the Constellation program was cancelled without consulting Congress, widening the gap in America's ability to access Low Earth Orbit. As a result, American taxpayers are now forced to pay over $60 million per ride to the Russians for access to the International Space Station.
"Like America, NASA has suffered under President Obama's lack of leadership and operates in a vacuum without vision or a clear mission.
"Governor Romney's leadership will provide a path to American exceptionalism and provide the mission and attention needed to enhance our global competitiveness. A strong human space program is critical to attracting the science, technology, engineering and math leaders needed for America to remain globally competitive. Governor Romney understands how to accomplish this important goal, and his leadership as president will ensure that America continues to be the global leader in space exploration."
