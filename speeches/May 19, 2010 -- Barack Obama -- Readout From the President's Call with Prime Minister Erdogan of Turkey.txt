    President Obama spoke with Prime Minister Erdogan today by phone. The President acknowledged the efforts of Turkey and Brazil and noted that the United States and the international community await a formal and authoritative message from Iran to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The President stressed the international community’s continuing and fundamental concerns about Iran’s overall nuclear program as well as Iran’s failure to live up to its international obligations. Further, he indicated that negotiations on a new U.N. Security Council resolution will continue, noting that Iran’s persistent refusal to meet with the P5+1 on Iran’s nuclear program and recent refusal to halt enriching uranium to nearly 20 percent, do not build confidence. The President and Prime Minister also discussed the ongoing government formation process in Iraq and the need to advance peace in the Middle East.
