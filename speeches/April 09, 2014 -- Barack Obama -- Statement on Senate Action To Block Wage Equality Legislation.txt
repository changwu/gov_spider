    Today Senate Republicans overwhelmingly blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, preventing it from even receiving an honest debate, let alone a simple yes-or-no vote. The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the 1963 Equal Pay Act and reinforce our country's commitment to the principle of equal pay for equal work. Yesterday I took two actions that will make it easier for working women to earn fair pay, and my administration will continue to do everything we can to make sure that every hard-working American earns the respect and wages that they deserve on the job. But Republicans in Congress continue to oppose serious efforts to create jobs, grow the economy and level the playing field for working families. That's wrong, and it's harmful for our national efforts to rebuild an economy that gives every American who works hard a fair shot to get ahead.
