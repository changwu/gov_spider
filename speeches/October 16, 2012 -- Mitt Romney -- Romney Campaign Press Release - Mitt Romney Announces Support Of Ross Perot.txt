    Mitt Romney today announced the support of businessman and former presidential candidate Ross Perot.
"Ross Perot's accomplishments as an entrepreneur, as a political leader, as a naval officer make him a living legend," said Mitt Romney. "He understands the challenges facing the nation and what it will take to meet them. I am proud to have his support."
"Our country faces a serious choice," said Ross Perot. "The fact of the matter is that the United States is on unsustainable course. At stake is nothing less than our position in the world, our standard of living at home, and our constitutional freedoms. That is why I am endorsing Mitt Romney in his quest for the presidency. We can't afford four more years in which national debt mushrooms out of control, our government grows, and our military is weakened. Mitt has the background, experience, intelligence, and integrity to turn things around. He has my absolute support."
