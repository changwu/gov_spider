    I am pleased with today's Supreme Court decision in Bragdon v. Abbott. This decision reinforces the protections offered by the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act for Americans living with HIV and AIDS. The ADA was enacted with strong bipartisan support to protect Americans with disabilities from discrimination. My administration argued successfully in this case that people with HIV are disabled whether or not they have developed the symptoms of AIDS.
I am firmly committed to protecting all Americans, including those living with HIV and AIDS, from discrimination, and ensuring that each of us can benefit from all America has to offer. Today's decision will help in fulfilling that commitment.
