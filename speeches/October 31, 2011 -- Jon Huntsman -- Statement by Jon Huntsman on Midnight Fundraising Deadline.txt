We need a nominee who can beat President Obama and unite Republicans, Independents and disaffected Democrats, just as Ronald Reagan did. We don't need hope and hype anymore; we need solutions. 
We need a new President who will immediately fight for regulatory reform, a fairer tax code and energy independence, because these are the policies that will create jobs across the nation. 
We need a principled leader who has a set of core beliefs they can draw upon in the Oval Office. We don't need a nominee who is choosing his positions like a weather vane blowing in the political winds.
If you agree, I hope you will support my campaign for President with an immediate donation before midnight of $10, $25, $50, $100 or more. 
Our support in New Hampshire is on the rise and you can feel the excitement on the campaign trail. What we need now are the financial resources to compete.
So please endorse my campaign with an immediate donation of $10, $25, $50, $100 or more before our midnight fundraising deadline. 
I am counting on your support.
Sincerely,
Jon Huntsman
