    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Young (R). Florida)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R. 2126, the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, FY 1996, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.
The Administration is committed to balancing the Federal budget by FY 2005. The President's budget proposes to reduce FY 1996 discretionary spending by $5 billion in outlays below the FY 1995 enacted level. The Administration must evaluate each bill both in terms of funding levels provided and the share of total resources available for remaining priorities.
The Administration does not support the Committee's 602(b) allocations or the level of funding provided by the Committee bill, which is $7.8 billion above the President's request. By providing increases for defense programs that are neither warranted nor justified, the bill would seriously undermine the President's goal of achieving a balanced budget while increasing investment programs essential to a higher standard of living for all Americans. As reflected in his budget, the President firmly believes that it is possible to maintain a strong defense without sacrificing critical investments. The Committee's allocation raises serious concerns about the overall priorities reflected in the appropriations process. For this reason and other concerns discussed in a "Statement of Administration Policy" of July 31, 1995, the President's senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill if it were presented to him in its current form.
