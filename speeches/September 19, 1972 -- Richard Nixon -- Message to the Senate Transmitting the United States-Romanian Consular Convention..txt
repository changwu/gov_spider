    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Socialist Republic of Romania, signed at Bucharest on July 5, 1972.
The Convention was signed by Secretary of State William P. Rogers, who was paying an official visit to Romania, and by Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu. It is evidence of the continued improvement and expansion of United States-Romanian relations.
This new Convention, replacing one concluded in 1881, will make possible improved consular services in both countries. It will ensure unhindered communication between a citizen and his consul and prompt visit by consuls to citizens who are detained. Under the Convention, American citizens in Romania will have a fuller degree of consular assistance and protection than ever before.
I hope that the Senate will act favorably on the Consular Convention with Romania at an early date.
