    LITTLE ROCK, AR - Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement today in honor of Veterans Day:
"Today we honor American military men and women who have served, or are currently serving, our country so we may enjoy the blessings of freedom and democracy. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brave individuals, as well as to those who have paid the ultimate price, so that we may be free to reach our fullest potential. Their sacrifices for our grateful nation must never be forgotten. It is our duty to ensure that their faithful service is truly recognized by upholding our promises to provide the opportunities and support they need.
"Janet and I pray for our troops as well as their families, who keep the home fires burning while their loved ones are away. May God bless our veterans and their families, and may God continue to bless America."
