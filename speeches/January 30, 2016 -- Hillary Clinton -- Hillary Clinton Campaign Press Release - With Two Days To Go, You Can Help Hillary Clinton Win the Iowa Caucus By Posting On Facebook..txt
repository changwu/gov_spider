    
It really is that easy.
I've worked on a lot of campaigns. And I can tell you from experience—from exhilarating wins to heartbreaking losses—that there is one thing that gets people to the polls and decides the outcome of elections on the ground:
Asking your friends, family, and neighbors to go out and vote.
Most of you probably don't live in Iowa—I don't either. But I bet you know someone who does. And if you want to make sure Hillary Clinton wins the Iowa caucus on February 1 and heads to New Hampshire with as much momentum as possible, please believe that the most important thing you can do right now to help Hillary on Monday night is post a message on Facebook and tag your friends in Iowa. (Here's how to find your Iowa friends on Facebook—and even if you truly truly don't know anyone in Iowa, write a post anyway!)
It really is that easy. And I'm going to make this even easier for you.
Here's what I'm posting on Facebook—and what a co-worker of mine is posting as well. Write your own or use ours as inspiration!


Don't forget to tag your friends in Iowa!
This is it: It's game time. Let's support our candidate and inspire others to do the same. These next few days could easily define this campaign—so let's leave it all on the field and go win this thing.
