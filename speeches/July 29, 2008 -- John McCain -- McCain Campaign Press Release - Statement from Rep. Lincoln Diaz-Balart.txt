    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) issued the following statement on Hispanic outreach efforts:
"Unlike Barack Obama, John McCain doesn't need an introduction to the Hispanic Community. John McCain has been working for more than two decades for the values, principles and issues Latinos cares about. Hispanics will elect the next President of the United States based on who has the best record, experience and is better prepared to move this country forward. John McCain wants to keep taxes low for hardworking families, and small business owners, Barack Obama has stated he will raise taxes. John McCain has an energy plan, and wants to lower gas prices, Barack Obama has no plan. John McCain always put this country first, Barack Obama changes his mind depending on the political calendar."
