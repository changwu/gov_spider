    I have today signed H.R. 3914, a bill "To require the Secretary of Agriculture to make an earlier announcement of the 1984 crop feed grain program and of the 1985 crop wheat and feed grain programs."
I vetoed an earlier bill on this subject, H.R. 3564, because it mandated early and rigid announcement dates. They would not have allowed the Secretary of Agriculture sufficient time to collect and evaluate critical information on the harvest of current crops, before committing to a specific program for the following year.
H.R. 3914 will permit the Secretary of Agriculture a 30-day period to adjust the initial program announcements. H.R. 3564 did not permit such an adjustment.
I am approving H.R. 3914 because I believe that it will meet the needs of farmers, while also allowing the Department of Agriculture to carry out its responsibilities to manage these programs in a timely and efficient manner.
