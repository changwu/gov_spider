To Jay Solomon
I accept your resignation with regret and with gratitude for the services you have rendered to this Administration and to the American taxpaper.
Because of your leadership and integrity, decades of waste and corruption at the GSA are now being exposed, and those who have betrayed the public trust are being identified and punished. That process will be continued and expanded.
Your willingness to be available to assist your successor after March 31st will help me to insure that the investigations, reorganization and administrative improvements you began will be pursued aggressively.
You take with you my warmest personal affection and best wishes.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Joel W. Solomon, Administrator, General Services Administration, Washington, D.C. 20405]
