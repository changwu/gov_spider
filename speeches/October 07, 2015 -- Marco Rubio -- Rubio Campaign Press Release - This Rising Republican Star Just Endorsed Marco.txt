Richardson, one of the state's highest ranking Republicans, is just 38, and has rapidly risen in the state house since his election in 2010.
Richardson emphasized Marco's forward-looking ideas and vision for a New American Century in his endorsement:

Too many politicians and their ideas expired in the 20th century, which is why Washington is broken and why I support Marco Rubio for President.
Marco's plan for a New American Century is built around ideas for tomorrow, instead of the same policies of yesterday. I look forward to leading Marco's team in Missouri.
Missouri's Republican primary is on March 15 alongside other key states.
Richardson represents parts of Butler and Dunklin Counties, in the southeast corner of the state, and hails from Poplar Bluff.
