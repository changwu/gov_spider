    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting to the Congress the budget of the District of Columbia for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1974.
The budget proposals herein have been prepared by the Mayor-Commissioner and the City Council in accordance with their responsibilities under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967, and they also reflect the comments of the citizens of the District during City Council budget hearings. Further review of these proposals has been made by the Office of Management and Budget as specified in the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1970.
The fiscal year 1975 budget represents the assumption of new responsibilities by the District of Columbia as it moves toward more self-government. The great progress made in recent years by the District Government in program and fiscal management attest to its ability to move effectively along the path charted by the District of Columbia Self-government and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973. This budget indicates that the city welcomes these additional responsibilities and that it is prepared to work with the Congress on behalf of all residents of the District of Columbia to improve local government and the quality of city life.
I urge the Congress to act upon these proposals in the same spirit.
