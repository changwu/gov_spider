    Leading online activists praise Richardson as only candidate who actually will end the war, get all our troops out of Iraq
SANTA FE, NM-- The Richardson for President campaign released a new ad today that will begin airing in New Hampshire on Wednesday. The ad highlights that Governor Richardson is the only major Presidential candidate with a plan to get all of our troops out of Iraq. The Richardson plan actually ends the war and leaves no residual forces behind.
The ad, called "Long Enough," is the first by any candidate in this campaign to prominently feature online activists. In the ad, Chris Bowers and Matt Stoller of Openleft.com and Christina Siun O'Connell of Firedoglake.com praise Governor Richardson as the only candidate with a plan that actually ends the war.

The thirty-second ad follows the release of a longer video emphasizing Governor Richardson's position on Iraq, "The Choice on Iraq," which also features Bowers, Stoller, and Siun O'Connell.

"It is very simple," campaign manager Dave Contarino said. "Governor Richardson is the only candidate who will get all of our troops out of Iraq and actually end this war. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards all would leave tens of thousands of troops in Iraq indefinitely."
The ad, produced by Mark Putnam and Steve Murphy of Murphy Putnam Media, is designed to harness the power of the netroots community to spread Governor Richardson's message to voters around the country. Over the past few months, Richardson has climbed in the polls in the important early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Governor Richardson consistently has registered double-digit support, most recently in the ONE Campaign's Iowa poll and the WMUR-TV poll in New Hampshire.
