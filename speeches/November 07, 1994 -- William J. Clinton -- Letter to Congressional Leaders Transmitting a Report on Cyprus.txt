    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am submitting to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through July 31, 1994. The current report covers the period August 1, 1994, through September 30, 1994.
During this time frame U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher met regularly with the leaders of the two communities. He is working closely with the United Nations in an effort to bring Mr. Clerides and Mr. Denktash together for face-to-face meetings. I am very concerned with the lack of progress during this period and believe direct meetings between the two leaders are crucial to avoid an impasse.
James Williams was appointed on October 21 as U.S. Special Coordinator for Cyprus. He will travel shortly to Athens, Ankara, and Nicosia to consult with the parties.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
