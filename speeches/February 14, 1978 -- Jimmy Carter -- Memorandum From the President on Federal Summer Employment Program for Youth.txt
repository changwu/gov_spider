    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
When schools throughout the Nation close for the summer, many young men and women will be seeking summer jobs. This year, due to the high degree of unemployment among youth, Federal managers, and employers in the private sector, must increase their efforts to provide meaningful employment experiences for young Americans.
Through summer employment, young people will have opportunities to apply what they have learned in the classroom. For many, summer employment will enable them to earn funds necessary to return to school in the fall.
I am asking each of you to personally support the Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth. In selecting students to work in the Federal Government, we must ensure that special efforts are made to attract needy young people. For this reason, we are again setting an employment goal of one needy youth for every forty regular employees.
Chairman Alan K. Campbell and his staff at the Civil Service Commission will provide leadership to the Summer Employment Program, and will report to me on our accomplishments. Commission staff will soon be providing you with more details on the program.
I urge each of you to take full advantage of this opportunity.
JIMMY CARTER
