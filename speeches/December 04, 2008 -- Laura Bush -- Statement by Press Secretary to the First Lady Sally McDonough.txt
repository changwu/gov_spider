    The President and Mrs. Bush have purchased a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood in Dallas, Texas, where they will live after the President leaves office in January 2009. They will continue to spend time at Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas.
The President and Mrs. Bush do not have occupancy of the home, and therefore, no additional details will be provided.
The Bushes previously lived in Dallas from December 1988 through January 1995, before moving to the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas.
