    In a 30-minute Newsmax election special, Michael Reagan, conservative columnist, radio host, and the eldest son of former President Ronald Reagan, offered the following comments:
"Soon Iowa will make a critical vote . . . In a minute we are featuring a person who we believe will help continue my father's vision . . . A man who fought in Congress for my father's programs. That person is Newt Gingrich.
"Millions of dollars have been spent in negative ads against him. But let's discuss the real Newt Gingrich. . . .  Newt became a leading ally of my father, Ronald Reagan. He helped Congress push through massive tax cuts.  He worked to secure a military buildup that helped defeat the Soviet Union.  Under his leadership Congress also limited the welfare state.  . . As a leader in the Reagan Revolution, Gingrich began to confront both Democrats and Republicans in Congress for their cozy insider deals. . . Gingrich led the most reform-minded Congress in America. . . He has helped keep my father's legacy alive."
Reagan's comments come on the heels of the endorsement by the renowned economist Art Laffer, the architect of the Reagan economic recovery in the 1980s.  Mr. Laffer will appear with Newt today in Iowa.
