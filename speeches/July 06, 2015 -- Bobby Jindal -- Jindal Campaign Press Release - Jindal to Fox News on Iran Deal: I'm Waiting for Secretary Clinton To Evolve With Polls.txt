Governor Jindal said, "We're hearing from Secretary Kerry that we may be getting close to a bad deal with Iran... I'm just waiting for Secretary Clinton to evolve with the polls and disavow this foreign policy of appeasement. They could start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East — as bad as ISIS is, and ISIS is bad, allowing Iran to become a nuclear power could encourage Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey to get their own nuclear weapons... talk about the potential for an Armageddon, for mass genocide by having these multiple countries with nuclear power."
