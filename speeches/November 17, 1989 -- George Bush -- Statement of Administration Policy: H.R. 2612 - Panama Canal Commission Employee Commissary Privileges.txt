    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 5 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2612. Article IV of the Panama Canal Treaty provides that commissaries and exchanges are to be reserved for the exclusive use of members of the Armed Forces or their dependents. Unilateral provision of such access to U.S. citizens employed by the Panama Canal Commission, as H.R. 2612 would require, would be inconsistent with this U.S. treaty obligation.
The Administration recognizes the hardships the current crisis in Panama has created for U.S. citizen employees of the Commission and their families, and has acted to alleviate them. In 1988, the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the legitimate Panamanian Government, directed that they be provided temporary military shoppette privileges. In addition, the stocks of these stores have been expanded to include additional items specified by the Panama Canal Commission. The Administration will continue to assure that the welfare of these U.S. citizens is provided for, consistent with our treaty obligations.
