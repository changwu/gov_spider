    Today's announcement of funding to expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics is a critical step in helping to expand the availability of evidence-based community mental health services. These clinics are proven to improve health outcomes while lowering costs, by delivering 24/7 mental health and substance use care to millions of Americans, no matter who they are or whether they have ability to pay. Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the American Rescue Plan, and funding in this year's budget, my administration is working to expand this program to communities that need them most.
Mental health affects all of us, which is why I named tackling the mental health crisis a core pillar of my unity agenda. As I outlined in my State of the Union address last March, we can and must do more to transform how we address mental health in America.
In June, I was proud to sign the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which included unprecedented resources to help address mental health needs across our Nation, particularly for young people that have been exposed to violence. Over the past few weeks, my administration has announced the availability of funding that will help grow the pipeline of school-based mental health professionals, expand trauma-informed services in schools, and connect youth in need to mental health experts via telehealth.
In the coming weeks, my administration will be announcing additional resources to support our heroic mental health workers and help communities strengthen mental health. My administration remains committed to ensuring that everyone has access to services and support when and where they need them.
