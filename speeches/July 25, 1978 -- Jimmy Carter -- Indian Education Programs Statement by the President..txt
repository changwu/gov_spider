    Under my proposal for a Cabinet department of education, the Indian education programs now located in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) would be moved to the new department. I have recommended this transfer because I believe it will make Federal school-based programs more effective.
This transfer will not change the special relationships between the Government and Indian tribes and Indian people in any way. These relationships include Federal trust responsibilities, Indian self-determination, and Indian preference in hiring. My goal is to improve the delivery of education services. to Indians while maintaining these special relationships.
It is especially important that we maintain educational services to Indians without interruption, protect their civil rights, preserve the integrity of the education programs, and strengthen participation of parents, tribes, and Indian people in the education of their youth. A clear recognition of the importance of these issues will help us achieve an orderly, phased transfer of the BIA programs to the new department, while protecting the interests of Indian people. I expect .and hope that Indian tribes and Indian people will work with my Reorganization Project staff to assure that these objectives are met.
Throughout the Nation, our educational systems are facing important challenges. For the first time, the new department will permit a coordinated and high-level response to these challenges. I ask Indian tribes and Indian people to join with us in shaping a new department of education that is responsive to their concerns and worthy of their support.
