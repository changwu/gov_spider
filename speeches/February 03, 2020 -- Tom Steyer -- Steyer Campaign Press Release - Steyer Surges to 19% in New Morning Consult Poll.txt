    Steyer gains 2 points in early state tracker
(SAN FRANCISCO, CA, February 3, 2020) — Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer surged to 19% support in Morning Consult's latest early state tracker — a 2 point gain from last week's survey, trailing Senator Bernie Sanders by just one point and Vice President Biden by just four.
This latest result keeps Steyer in third place and underscores the campaign's traction in early states as suggested by a South Carolina Change Research poll released this week showing Steyer up 13 points at 18% with the support of 24% of African American voters, just 6 points behind Vice President Biden. The Morning Consult survey also demonstrates the significant challenges facing Mayor Pete and Amy Klobuchar with diverse electorates.

"All of the recent early state polling confirms what we've been seeing on the ground for a long time. Tom's support across these states has picked up dramatically after he was able to meet with voters face-to-face and share his vision for our country," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "Early state voters who get to hear Tom's message clearly believe he's the best candidate to put together the diverse coalition needed to beat Donald Trump in November. We are excited to see this momentum continue as we make our way through February."
The latest poll comes on the same day the caucuses begin in Iowa. Steyer is traversing the early states to energize supporters and build on his continued momentum.
