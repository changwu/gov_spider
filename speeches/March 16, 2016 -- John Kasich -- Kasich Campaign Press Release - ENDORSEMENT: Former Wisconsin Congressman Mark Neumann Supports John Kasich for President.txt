    Former Congressman Mark Neumann today endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America Wisconsin leadership team.
Said Neumann, "I served alongside John Kasich in Congress as we fought the establishment to produce a balanced budget. John is a man of great conviction, determination and civility, and he's exactly the leader America needs in the Oval Office. I'm proud to announce my support for his candidacy and spread his message of results in Wisconsin."

Neumann represented Wisconsin's First Congressional District from 1995 to 1998. The Wisconsin native is a business owner by profession.
"I'm grateful for the generous support of my friend and former colleague Congressman Neumann. Mark was right there with me in Congress as we balanced the federal budget for the first time in a generation. He and I share a common vision for a federal government that leaves more power and influence to the states and more money in the pockets of hardworking taxpayers."
