    Five distinguished private-sector leaders have agreed to launch a nationwide effort to encourage private donations for relief and reconstruction in response to the South Asia earthquake that occurred on October 8. These leaders will work with other Americans to raise awareness and resources to help those in need as a result of this disaster.
This private-sector effort will complement the commitment the United States Government has made in terms of funding, relief commodities, and critical military logistical support. In addition, the United States has sent a delegation, headed by USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios, to the United Nations Emergency Donors' Conference for South Asia Earthquake Relief in Geneva.
The business leaders are Jeff Immelt, chairman and CEO of the General Electric Company; Hank McKinnell, Jr., Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Pfizer, Inc.; Sandy Weill, chairman of Citigroup, Inc.; Anne Mulcahy, chairman and CEO of Xerox Corporation; and Jim Kelly, former chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service of America, Inc. In the coming days, they will ask Americans to donate directly to a fund set up to provide help to the earthquake victims.
