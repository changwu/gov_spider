    On Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Awareness Day, our Nation recognizes those who have been affected by PTSD and commits to improving treatment options.
An estimated 8 percent of Americans experience PTSD at some point in their lives, including children and adolescents exposed to abuse and trauma. That is just one reason why my Administration is working toward improving access to mental healthcare for all Americans. I will fight every day to deliver on the healthcare reforms our Nation deserves.
Our Nation's veterans are unfortunately among those PTSD affects. Our veterans are our heroes, and we need their vital contributions to our society. They have earned the world-class healthcare my Administration has pledged to provide to them. As part of that pledge, I signed the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act. This Act extends and improves the Veterans Choice Program, through which eligible veterans can see the doctor of their choice, advancing their path to recovery.
On this day, we commit to helping our fellow Americans by ensuring that they have the chance to enjoy the blessings of our great Nation free from the suffering of PTSD.
