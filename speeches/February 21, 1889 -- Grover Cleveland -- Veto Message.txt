    To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 11803, entitled "An act granting a pension to Henry V. Bass."
This beneficiary enlisted September 9, 1862, and was mustered out August 15, 1865. The records show no disability during his service.
It is now alleged that the soldier was sitting on the ground near his tent while two comrades were wrestling near him, and that in the course of the scuffle one of the parties engaged in it was thrown or fell upon the beneficiary, injuring his right knee and ankle.
Upon these facts the claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that the injury was not received in the line of duty.
I do not think that the Government should be held as an insurer against injuries of this kind, which are in no manner related to the performance of military service.
