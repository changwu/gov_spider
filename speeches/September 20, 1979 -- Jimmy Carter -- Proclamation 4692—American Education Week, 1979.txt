  A Proclamation

Our nation has come a long way toward realizing the Founders' dream of having an educated electorate, so that all our people might share fully in freedom, justice and opportunity. In this International Year of the Child, as we join with other nations to understand and meet the needs of children around the world, we are especially aware of the importance of education.
The theme of this year's American Education Week, "Teach All the Children", acknowledges both our goal and what must be done to accomplish it. The responsibility for educating our children lies not just with the schools, but with parents and communities as well.
Every American has a responsibility to make sure that our children do not merely pass through school systems, but actually receive the education they need. To do that, we must find ways to reach every child?regardless of race, sex, religion national origin or economic background and responding to particular needs be cause of physical or mental handicaps or special talents. We must respect and nourish each child's unique potential.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning November 11, 1979, as American Education Week.
I ask for the support of every American in helping to create challenging educational opportunities that will help develop the diverse abilities of children, and to help nurture in each a sense of excellence and respect for all mankind.
I urge individuals and groups to work with schools in their communities to ensure that they are able to "Teach All the Children" well.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
