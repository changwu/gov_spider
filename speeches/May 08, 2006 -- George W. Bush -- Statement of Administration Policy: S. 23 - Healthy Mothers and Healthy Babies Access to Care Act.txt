    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Santorum (R) PA and 16 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 23, legislation that addresses women's impaired access to prenatal and obstetric care caused by the Nation's badly broken medical liability system. In many States, obstetricians and gynecologists are being driven to close or dramatically reduce their practices because they cannot afford or even obtain medical liability insurance. This has made it more difficult for patients to access affordable, quality health care, and is especially troublesome for pregnant women in rural areas who need prenatal and obstetric health care services. S. 23 would improve women's access to these vital health care services in their communities.
While S. 23 would address the medical malpractice liability crisis facing obstetricians and gynecologists and their patients, the Administration continues to support comprehensive legislation such as S. 22 to reform the Nation's medical liability system. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation that meets the President's goals of reducing medical malpractice premiums and overall health care costs by limiting excessive non-economic and punitive damage awards, limiting attorneys' fees, and minimizing frivolous lawsuits and time-consuming legal proceedings.
