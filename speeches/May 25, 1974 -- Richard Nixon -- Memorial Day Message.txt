    Once again, on Memorial Day 1974, the American people join in tribute to the courageous servicemen and women who have given their lives to protect our country's liberty and bring peace to our Nation and the world.
In honoring the fallen, let us also remember the millions of others who have served in past wars and the fine men and women who today serve in our all-volunteer Armed Forces. They, too, have preserved our freedom; they, too, are helping to create a future free of war.
The peace we enjoy today, and the peaceful future we look forward to, are based on the devotion and sacrifice of the long, brave line of men and women in uniform who have proudly served the American flag. The prayers and the gratitude of the American people are with them and their families on this Memorial Day.
