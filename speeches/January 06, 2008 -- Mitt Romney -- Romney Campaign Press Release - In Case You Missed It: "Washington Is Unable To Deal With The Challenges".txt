    Governor Mitt Romney
ABC's "This Week"
January 6, 2008
ABC's George Stephanopoulos: "Let's move on because last night you seemed to take hits from just about everyone on that stage."
Governor Romney: "Wasn't that great? It was terrific."
Stephanopoulos: "I can't believe you believe it was great and terrific."
Governor Romney: "It's like the guy with the ball is the guy people are trying to tackle. So I'm delighted to have everybody talking about me. You know, it's like that old joke, I'll talk about me, when I get finished, why don't you talk about me."
...
Stephanopoulos: "Seemed to be something else going on on the stage last night. I just wonder what you think about it. I watched Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, all of them jumping on, and it seems like they have almost a visceral dislike of you."
Governor Romney: "Oh, I think people recognize I'm in a pretty good position and, frankly, I think people who watch the debate had to say to themselves, 'What is it about these politicians that are more focused on insults than on issues?' It's what's wrong with politics. We have extraordinary challenges in America right now. But Washington is unable to deal with the challenges because they're so consumed with score settling and attacks on fellow Republicans or the Democrats. We've really got to have somebody who just doesn't care about all the attacks and insults, who's focused on getting the job done for the American people."
