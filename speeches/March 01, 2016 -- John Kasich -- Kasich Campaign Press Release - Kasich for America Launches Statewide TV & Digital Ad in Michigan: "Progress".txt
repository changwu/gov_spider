    Today Kasich for America announced a significant new statewide TV and digital ad buy in Michigan.
"Progress," which will begin airing statewide on Tuesday, points to John Kasich's record of success as governor of Ohio: 400,000 new private sector jobs, the largest tax cut in the nation and fewer regulations slowing the growth of small businesses.


Said Senior Adviser John Weaver, "Gov. Kasich is the only candidate who can deliver the leadership Michigan and America need. He enacted the nation's largest tax cut, eliminated a massive budget deficit and helped Ohio create 400,000 new jobs. While others talk, Governor Kasich has produced results."
