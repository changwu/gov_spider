    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/3/93)(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and 2 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3354, which provides for substance abuse treatment in State and local correctional facilities. The Administration believes such programs will be most effective if coordinated with existing substance abuse treatment programs funded by the Department of Health and Human Services which can provide necessary community-based aftercare services.
