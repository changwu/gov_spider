Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Tennessee Romney for President Leadership Team. The men and women who make up this team are leading the efforts for Governor Romney in Tennessee and spreading his message of change in Washington.
Announcing the Leadership Team, Governor Romney said, "I am honored to have the support of so many outstanding leaders in Tennessee. These fine men and women are dedicated to returning to our Republican roots and building a stronger economy, stronger military and stronger families. Together, the Tennessee Leadership Team has been working to spread our message of conservative change."
"I'm proud to support Governor Mitt Romney for President. Washington is broken – and we're not going to fix it by sending the same people back just to sit in different chairs. Governor Romney is uniquely qualified to bring change to Washington, D.C. Throughout his career, he has been an agent of change. He created jobs in the private sector. He turned around the ethically and financially challenged 2002 Winter Olympic Games. And as the chief executive of Massachusetts, he cut taxes and promoted innovative solutions that created jobs and expanded health coverage," said former Tennessee Governor Winfield Dunn.
