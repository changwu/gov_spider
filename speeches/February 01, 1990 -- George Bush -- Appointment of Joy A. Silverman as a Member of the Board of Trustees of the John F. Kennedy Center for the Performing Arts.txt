    The President today announced his intention to appoint Joy A. Silverman as a member of the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Last year, Mrs. Silverman was nominated by the President to be U.S. Ambassador to Barbados, accredited also to Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. She has asked, however, that, for family reasons, the President not return her name to the Senate for this post. The President remains fully confident in Mrs. Silverman and her capacity for public service and is pleased she has agreed to devote her considerable energy to the Kennedy Center.
Mrs. Silverman was a full-time participant in President Bush's 1988 campaign and assisted the New York State campaign director. From 1987 to 1988, she served as a member, and later as chairman, of the advisory council to the New York State Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. Mrs. Silverman has served as a member of the New York City mayor's commission for protocol. In addition to extensive work for various educational institutions, she has served actively with various charitable organizations in the New York metropolitan area. Mrs. Silverman attended the University of Maryland. She is married, has two children, and currently resides in New York City.
