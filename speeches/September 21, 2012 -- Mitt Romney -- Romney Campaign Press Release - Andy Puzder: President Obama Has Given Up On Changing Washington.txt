    Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc., today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about not being able to change Washington:  
"I have no doubt that Washington is a difficult place to change. But I can't agree with Barack Obama when he says that 'you can't change Washington from the inside.' This appears to be a blunt acknowledgement of surrender. He is telling us that he has given up on his own aspirations. But the fact of the matter is that he has changed Washington—for the worse. He's played to its worst instincts. He's grown its power. He's exacerbated its partisan divisions. If he is persuaded that he cannot succeed, one wonders why he is running for a second term. If in his view, Washington can only be repaired from the outside, he should leave the White House and continue his work elsewhere. I hope, come November, that Mitt Romney will show him the door."
