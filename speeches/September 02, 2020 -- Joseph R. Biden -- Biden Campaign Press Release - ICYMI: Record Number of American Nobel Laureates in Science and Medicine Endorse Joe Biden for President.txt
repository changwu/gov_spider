Record Number of American Nobel Laureates in Science and Medicine Endorse Joe Biden for President
During Global Pandemic, 81 Nobel Prize Winners in Chemistry, Medicine and Physics Demand a President Who Will Listen To Science
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, in an open letter to the American people, 81 U.S. Nobel Laureates in science and medicine endorsed Vice President Joe Biden for president of the United States. This is the largest number of Nobel Prize winners ever to endorse a candidate for office.
"At no time in our nation's history has there been a greater need for our leaders to appreciate the value of science in formulating public policy," the Nobel Laureates wrote. "During his long record of public service, Joe Biden has consistently demonstrated his willingness to listen to experts, his understanding of the value of international collaboration in research and his respect for the contribution that immigrants make to the intellectual life of our country."
In 2016, 70 Nobel laureates endorsed Hilary Clinton, and 76 Nobel laureates backed Barack Obama for president in 2008. The Nobel laureates endorsing Biden include recipients in medicine, chemistry and physics.
"In the past, Joe Biden has shown a deep appreciation for using science to find solutions to America's ailments," said Harold Varmus, who has served as director of the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute and received the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine. "His sensible, determined approach to building a cancer research initiative after his son's death was inspiring. It illustrates the kind of thoughtful leadership that we need to tackle the current global pandemic."
"Now more than ever, our country needs elected leaders who make decisions based on science," said Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine. "Joe Biden is the strong, compassionate leader we need to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. He'll listen to the scientific and medical community to create solutions that will finally get us out of this deadly pandemic and improve the health of the American people."
"The multiple crises facing our country, including one of misinformation, requires a leader with profound admiration for science and truth," said Roger Kornberg, 2006 Nobel Prize in chemistry. "I support Joe Biden's pro-science agenda and sensible approach to public health decisions. He is a true leader who will face the truth and be honest with the American people."
"Our elected leaders should be making decisions based on facts and science," said Carol Greider, 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine. "I strongly endorse Joe Biden because of his commitment to putting public health professionals, not politicians, back in charge."
"I support Joe Biden because of his long record of making policy, informed by science, to deal with large, complicated issues like cancer, climate change and nuclear proliferation," said Barry Barish, 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. "More immediately, we absolutely must elect Joe with his science-based approach to successfully lead us out of the Covid-19 pandemic."
"The ultimate judge of science is nature, not voodoo politicians. We need a strong leader who will listen to science and combat the crises of COVID and climate change," said David Gross, 2004 Nobel Prize in physics. "Joe Biden will listen and lead, and that is why I strongly endorse him."
