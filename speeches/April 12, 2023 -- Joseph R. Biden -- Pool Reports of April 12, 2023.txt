Travel Pool Report 2 — Biden mtg with Sunak
Pool was brought into a conference room at 11:21 am BST, where Biden and Sunak sat next to each other sat at a table, cups and saucers in front of them (unclear if they were drinking coffee or tea).
"Heck of a view out there," Biden said, looking out the windows of the 23rd floor room.
In response to a shouted question on what he was going to say to the Northern Ireland political parties, Biden said: "I'm going to listen."
He did not respond to further shouted questions, including on trade and the document leaks.
Sunak did not make any comments.
Pool was ushered out at 11:22 and is headed to the motorcade.

Travel Pool Report 6 — Biden remarks end
Biden concluded his remarks at 1:16pm BST.
Biden hailed the 1998 Good Friday agreement, pointing to the university as an example of how the "dividends of peace are all around us," and acknowledged the difficult work that went into reaching the accord.
He emphasized the strength of the relationship between the US and Northern Ireland, and its investment in ensuring peace continues: "The American people are with you, every step of the way, it's real."
Biden added that maintaining the Good Friday agreement is a priority for both Republicans and Democrats, something he said "is unusual today" given the partisanship in the US. "This is something that brings Washington together."
Biden also touted Northern Ireland's economic progress and potential.
At one point he acknowledged Belfast actor James Martin, star of Oscar-winning film An Irish Goodbye, who was sitting in the audience. Biden said he'd gotten a photo with Martin earlier.
Biden discussed the need to preserve democracy, and expressed his hope that Northern Ireland's government would find ways to to work together.
He finished by pledging continued partnership between the US and Northern Ireland.
Biden is now greeting people along the rope line.

Travel Report 10 — Firehouse greeting and rolling to castle
Biden stopped at a firehouse just off the tarmac, where he delivered brief remarks to a crowd of about 250 embassy officials and their young children.
Biden thanked everyone for being there, and remarked about the importance of firefighters, before going over to greet the children and offering to take a few questions from them.
One child showed Biden his toy replica of AF1, to which he replied "oh look at this! Air Force 1."
Another then asked Biden about the key to success. He didn't appear the hear the full question and his son Hunter, standing nearby, restated it. Biden responded by saying it was important to remember that when you disagree with someone, you can question their judgment, but to never question their motives, or else it'll be impossible to get an agreement with them. He then told a lengthy, often-told anecdote from his time in the Senate involving former Sen. Jesse Helms, a conservative who he described as "not very crazy about African Americans." Biden said he was incensed at the time over Helms' opposition to efforts by then-Sens. Ted Kennedy and Bob Dole to shore up rights for people with disabilities, and vented to then-Majority Leader Mike Mansfield that Helms had no redeeming qualities.
Biden said that Mansfield responded by telling him about Helms' decision to adopt a special needs child a few years earlier, a revelation that Biden said made him feel foolish.
"That's a long answer to a real quick question," Biden concluded.
Another child asked Biden how his dogs were doing, to which he responded that they were "doing well."
Biden thanked the kids again and began greeting others along the rope line.
Motorcade left the firehouse at 4:14 pm local time. Due to a bad weather call we're skipping the planned trip to the cemetery and going straight to Carlingford Castle.

The President also spoke to New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy to offer federal assistance in response to the Jimmy's Waterhole Fire that started last night.



April 12, 202317:57 IST

Travel Pool Report 12 — Arrival at Castle
Motorcade arrived at Carlingford Castle at 5:55pm local time. The heavy rain throughout the drive didn't deter large groups of onlookers from gathering on highway overpasses and along the route, some of whom were waving Irish or American flags.
The castle is located in County Louth, where Biden's maternal ancestors, the Finnegans, are from.



April 12, 202318:00 IST

Travel Pool Report 13 — Background on Biden's castle visit
Per the WH:
The President is taking a guided tour of Carlingford Castle from Gerry Hoey, a Local Castle tour guide, and Yvonne Keenan-Ross, Project Manager for Carlingford Heritage Trust and Tourism. In attendance:
H. E. Micheál Martin, Tánaiste of IrelandT.H. Claire D. Cronin, Ambassador of the United States to IrelandMr. Rob Kearney, the President's cousin
Background
Carlingford Castle would have been the last Irish landmark that Owen Finnegan (President Biden's maternal great-great-grandfather) saw before he departed for New York. From the castle, the President will look across the water to Warrenpoint, Northern Ireland, from where Owen Finnegan departed the port of Newry over 174 years ago on March 31, 1849.
The water view from the Carlingford Castle is Carlingford Lough, a bay that empties into the Irish Sea.
The Carlingford Pipe Band, a four-piece bagpipe and drum ensemble, will play an original piece titled "A Biden Return." In 2020, they performed another original anthem, entitled "Our Local Joe," written as part of a local parade held in celebration of then-President-Elect Biden. They have played at festivals, sporting events, and international parades, including the New York City Saint Patrick's Day parade in 1989.

Travel Pool Report 14 — Castle tour and rolling
Biden, wearing blue cap, took in the view of the water from a landing in the castle while speaking with his tour guide. Pool also spotted Biden's son, Hunter, and sister Valerie.
Asked how it feels to be here, Biden said that "It feels wonderful! Feels like I'm coming home."
He was also asked what he thinks of the weather (which has been a steady rain). "It's fine. It's Ireland," Biden said.
Pool was escorted away shortly afterward, but could hear the the Carlingford Pipe Band playing in the distance.
Motorcade is back moving at 6:31pm en route to Dundalk.



April 12, 202319:32 IST

Travel Pool Report 15 — Stop at McAteers
Motorcade arrived in Dundalk at 7pm local time in front of McAteers The Food House, a local market and deli.
Biden greeted the crowds of people along the street, many of whom were waving small American flags. Biden took a handful of photos, shaking hands as he moved down the line. Hunter Biden and Valerie Biden Owen were also spotted shaking hands and talking with onlookers.
Biden then entered McAteers, greeting people inside before making his way over to the deli counter, where 10 workers had gathered.
Biden was introduced to each of the workers owner Jerome McAteer. McAteer introduced one worker by saying "he does more talking than working."
"I don't know, he sounds like me," Biden responded.
After Biden's son, Hunter, came up asked if he was going to order, Biden said he was just looking. "Well I may want to order something," Hunter said.
Later, Biden said "I don't know why the hell my ancestors left here. It's beautiful."
Pool was ushered out while Biden was still looking around the store, and before we could determine if Biden or Hunter ended up ordering. Pool is holding ahead of the next stop at Windsor Bar and Restaurant.



April 12, 202319:47 IST

The United States has contributed $551 million to the IFI since 1987.
