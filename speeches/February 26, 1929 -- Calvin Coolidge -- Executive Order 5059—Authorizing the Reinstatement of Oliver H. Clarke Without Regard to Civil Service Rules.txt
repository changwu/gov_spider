    Oliver H. Clarke may be reinstated to an appropriate position in the Office of the Supervising Architect, Treasury Department, without regard to the time limit upon his eligibility for reinstatement.
This Order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury who states that Mr. Clarke served in the Office of the Supervising Architect for a number of years, that his training and experience make him unusually well qualified for the position of Associate Architect, and that in view of the large building program now under way his appointment will be in the interest of the service.
The Civil Service Commission is unable to concur.
