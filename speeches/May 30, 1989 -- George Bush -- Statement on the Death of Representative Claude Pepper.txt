    Claude Pepper gave definition and meaning to the concept of public service. He fought for the poor and the elderly in his own determined way. Those who agreed with him were proud to follow his banner. Those who disagreed with him always respected him. Claude Pepper was a gentleman, a noble human being. America will miss him. Barbara and I will miss him, too.
