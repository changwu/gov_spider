    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain spokesman Ben Porritt issued the following statement on Barack Obama's selection of Joe Biden as his running mate:
"There has been no harsher critic of Barack Obama's lack of experience than Joe Biden. Biden has denounced Barack Obama's poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what Americans are quickly realizing -- that Barack Obama is not ready to be President."
