    Oklahoma Congressman Frank Lucas, Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for a vibrant rural America:
"I grew up on a family farm, and I know the doubt and uncertainty that comes with a livelihood tied to the land. I also know that with all of the worries that burden these Americans every day — from weather to pests — the last thing farmers and ranchers need is a manmade tax and regulatory disaster handed down from Washington. Over the last four years, President Obama's empty rhetoric and problematic policies have stifled America's agriculture sector, and the next four years are sure to be a disappointing repeat of the same failed policies. We need a president who understands our concerns and who will advocate for our jobs. When Mitt Romney is president, he will restore America's economy and deliver a real recovery."
