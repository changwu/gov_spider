 In town Pool Report #4: POTUS video 
?Pool has not seen the president in person today, but you have no doubt seen the pre-recorded, 4-minute video that he posted to his Twitter account "asking Congress" to amend the stimulus legislation and send him a "suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID-relief package."
I've asked the White House for additional information. Will let you know if we receive further comment on his activities today.
