  A Proclamation

No one has a fuller appreciation and respect for nature than the American sportsman. Hunters and anglers were among the first to warn us of the need to conserve America's fish and wildlife resources, and many of them have played an active, voluntary role in restoring and enriching America's splendid natural heritage.
In recognition of the significant contributions of American hunters and fishermen in enhancing and preserving our environment, and to dramatize the continued need for gun and boat safety, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 910, 93rd Congress, has requested the President to declare the fourth Saturday of September, 1974, as National Hunting and Fishing Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, September 28, 1974, as National Hunting and Fishing Day.
I urge all of our citizens to join with outdoor sports-men in the wise use of our natural resources and in insuring their proper management for the benefit of future generations.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred ninety-ninth.

GERALD R. FORD
