    Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve the New START Treaty with a strong bipartisan majority. I congratulate Senators Kerry and Lugar and all the members of the committee for their hard work and their thoughtful review. There is no question that the New START Treaty, once it takes effect, will protect our security and make the world a safer place. It will further improve our relationship with Russia and enable us to deepen our cooperation on a host of key issues, as well as further demonstrate America's leadership in efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. The President and I believe the full Senate should give this agreement the same broad bipartisan support shown today by the Foreign Relations Committee and that agreements of this kind historically have received from the United States Senate.
