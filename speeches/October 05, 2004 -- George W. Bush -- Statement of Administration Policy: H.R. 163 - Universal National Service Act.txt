    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rangel (D-NY) and 14 co-sponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 163, which would require virtually all U.S. citizens and residents age 18 to 26 to perform military or civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security. H.R. 163 is both unnecessary and counterproductive. If the President were presented with this bill, he would veto it.
The Department of Defense (DOD) already achieves broad public participation in our national defense and is aggressively pursing transformational reorganization to focus existing military manpower on mission-critical military jobs. Because volunteers are highly motivated, our armed services benefit from: (1) a more experienced and productive military force, (2) greater personnel retention and unit stability, and (3) reduced training requirements and expenses. H.R. 163 runs counter to DOD's efforts and would damage the efficiency, effectiveness, and morale of our Nation's fighting forces.
