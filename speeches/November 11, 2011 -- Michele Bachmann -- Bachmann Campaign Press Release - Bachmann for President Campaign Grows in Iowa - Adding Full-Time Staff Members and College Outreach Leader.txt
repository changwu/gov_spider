    Urbandale, Iowa â€“ Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann announced today the addition of two full-time staff members and a college leader to the already growing roster in Iowa. Two presidential campaign veterans, Megan McGreal Ferraro and Craig Handzlik, join the team as Advance Director and Lead Advance respectively. Iowa-native, Alex Latcham, will work as College Outreach Leader.
"Michele's true conservative message of limited government and economic growth resonates with Hawkeye voters statewide," said Eric Woolson, Iowa campaign manager. "Megan, Craig and Alex will play critical roles in taking her message across the state as our team pushes forward to win the all important first-in-the-nation caucuses on Jan. 3."
Ferraro will oversee the planning, scheduling and execution of all campaign events and event staff. Prior to her position with Bachmann for President, Ferraro worked on John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and Bush/Cheney's presidential bid in 2004. She has served as project manager for many national grassroots campaigns including the Consumer Electronics Association's "America Wins With Trade," and coordinated the planning, launching and execution of many national healthcare campaigns with Secretary Michael Leavitt, CMS Administrator Mark McClellan and CMS Administrator Kerry Weems at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
Handzlik is a campaign operative who served as a key advance member to former presidential candidate John McCain and running mate, former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. In addition to his campaign experience, Handzlik worked as lead advance to Secretary Michael Leavitt from HHS, among many other heads of state and elected officials. In his new role, Handzlik will oversee the logistics and execution of all Iowa events.
Latcham is a Des Moines native and a student at Drake University. He will head up outreach to Iowa's college Republican organizations and individual students.
