    The horrors of civil war and mass killings of civilians in Rwanda, since the tragic deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents 3 weeks ago, have shocked and appalled the world community.
On behalf of all of the American people, I call on the Rwandan army and the Rwandan Patriotic Front to agree to an immediate ceasefire and return to negotiations aimed at a lasting peace in their country.
I applaud the efforts of regional leaders actively engaged in the quest for peace. I reaffirm the American commitment to participate in renewed negotiations under the Arusha framework.
The pain and suffering of the Rwandan people have touched the hearts of all Americans. It is time for the leaders of Rwanda to recognize their common bond of humanity and to reject the senseless and criminal violence violence that continues to plague their country.
