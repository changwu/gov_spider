    Des Moines, IA -- At a press conference at the State Historical Society, Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie appeared with Senator Barack Obama and endorsed his campaign for president. Mayor Cownie cited Senator Obama's work to increase our investments in renewable fuels and praised Obama for his commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 and make America 50% more energy efficient by 2030.
"The real promise of Senator Obama's presidency isn't just the plans he'll bring with him into the White House, it's the visionary leadership he'll demonstrate once he gets there," Mayor Cownie said. "Barack Obama will put an end to the bitter partisanship that's stopped us from making progress on the urgent challenge of global warming. He'll tell the American people what they need to hear, not just what they want to hear. As President, he'll restore America's standing in the world and lead a global effort to meet this challenge once and for all."
Before elected mayor, Crownie served on the Des Moines City Council where he led the Gray's Lake Study and Planning Committee and Des Moines' long-term economic growth strategy, the "2020 Plan."
"Mayor Cownie has shown real leadership on environmental issues, and all Americans - not just the people of Des Moines - have benefited from it." Obama said. " I commend him for what he's doing and I look forward to working side-by-side with Mayor Cownie in the months and years to come."
Obama's comprehensive plan to combat global warming and achieve energy security will:
* Implement an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level recommended by top scientists to avoid calamitous impacts.
* Invest $150 billion over the next ten years to develop and deploy climate friendly energy supplies, protect our existing manufacturing base and create millions of new jobs.
* Dramatically improve energy efficiency to reduce energy intensity of our economy by 50 percent by 2030.
* Reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce oil consumption overall by at least 35 percent, or 10 million barrels of oil, by 2030
* Make the U.S. a leader in the global effort to combat climate change by leading a new international global warming partnership.
