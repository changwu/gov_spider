    Today, the President met with the House Democratic Caucus at the White House. The meeting lasted over an hour. The President thanked the House Democrats for their support of the clean, short-term continuing resolution that would re-open the government and end the unnecessary pain this shutdown is causing families across the country. The President and Congressional Democrats will continue to urge the Republican Leadership to allow the bill passed by the Senate to have an up or down vote -- a bill that, if brought to the floor, would pass with a bipartisan majority and end this damaging government shutdown. The President and the House Democrats reaffirmed their shared belief that we cannot let one faction of the Republicans in the House demand a ransom for Congress doing its job and paying the bills we have already incurred. The President discussed his desire, once the threat of default is removed and the government is reopened, to engage with both sides on a discussion of how we achieve a broader budget agreement that puts job creation, economic growth, and a strong middle class front and center. The President is grateful to the members of the House Democratic caucus for continuing to promote those policies we need to achieve a better bargain for the middle class. He reminded them that what they are all fighting for has nothing to do with him, or other party leaders - but is about fighting for working families and building the ladders of opportunity so everyone who works hard has a chance to succeed.
