    The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of former Prince George's County Executive Wayne Curry.
"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with the most experience and the vision needed to make the change to move our country forward," said Curry. "I have known Hillary for many years and have seen her tireless commitment to working on issues from education, health care, to her commitment to ensure that young males of color have the opportunity to succeed," he said. Curry has achieved many firsts. As a child he, along with his brother, integrated their elementary school in 1959. He was elected to the county executive's office in 1994, again making history when he became the first African American to serve in that office. Curry served two consecutive terms and today, is practicing law in the county. "I am proud to have the support from Wayne, whom I've known for many years," said Clinton. "He has been a tireless advocate and leader for social justice for many years. He remains an active leader in Maryland and the region and I know with his support he will champion my issues and deliver my messages to the people of Maryland," she concluded. Mr. Curry's career has encompassed government, civic, and community affairs for more than 30 years. Mr. Curry has received many awards and honors including Prince George's County Volunteer Action Center's Volunteer of the Year, Prince George's County Public Schools' Outstanding Leadership Education Award; Prince Georgian of the Year; and Washingtonian magazine's "New Establishment."; Curry received a bachelor's degree in Psychology from Western Maryland College, and graduated with honors from the University of Maryland School of Law.
