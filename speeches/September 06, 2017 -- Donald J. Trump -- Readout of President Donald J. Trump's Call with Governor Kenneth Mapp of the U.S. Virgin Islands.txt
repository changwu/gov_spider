    President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands to express his support for the Governor and the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands as the territory prepares for Hurricane Irma and to acknowledge the territory's experience in responding to hurricanes. The President confirmed that the Federal Government has been actively readying for the Hurricane Irma response even as the Government continues to support the States of Texas and Louisiana following Hurricane Harvey. FEMA will continue to coordinate with the emergency management staff of the U.S. Virgin Islands and will work with other Federal partners to help support the territory's efforts.
