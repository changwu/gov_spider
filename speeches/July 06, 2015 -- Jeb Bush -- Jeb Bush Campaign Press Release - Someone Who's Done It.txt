    Jeb has never been afraid to make tough decisions. As governor of Florida, he faced many battles and won. He took on the teachers unions, the trial bar and other special interests to upend the status quo and put Floridians first.
Hillary Clinton was a Senator for eight years and sponsored only three bills that became law.
Jeb knows how to lead and how to bring people together. He knows because he's done it as Governor of Florida. We need a conservative leader who will restore America as a beacon of peace and security for the world.
We need someone who's led by example. We need someone who's done it.
