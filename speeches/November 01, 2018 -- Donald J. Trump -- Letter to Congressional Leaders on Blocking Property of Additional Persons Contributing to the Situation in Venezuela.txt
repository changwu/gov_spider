    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order with respect to Venezuela that takes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017, Executive Order 13827 of March 19, 2018, and Executive Order 13835 of May 21, 2018.
The Executive Order I have issued blocks the property and interests in property of any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State: (i) to operate in the gold sector of the Venezuelan economy or in any other sector of the Venezuelan economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State; (ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, any transaction or series of transactions involving deceptive practices or corruption and the Government of Venezuela or projects or programs administered by the Government of Venezuela, or to be an immediate adult family member of such a person; (iii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, certain activities or transactions described in the order, or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; or (iv) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order.
I have authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including promulgating rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Executive Order.
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
