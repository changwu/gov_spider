    AUSTIN — Gov. Rick Perry today received the endorsement of Ohio conservative leader, entrepreneur and free market advocate Ken Blackwell in his campaign for president.
"I am proud to endorse Texas Gov. Rick Perry for president," said Blackwell. "Gov. Perry's successful record of job creation shows that he has the skill, experience and ideas necessary to get our nation working again. His proven conservative values, and his proven executive experience are exactly what this country needs to reverse the failed policies of the Obama Administration."
Blackwell, a long time conservative GOP leader from Cincinnati, was elected to statewide office in Ohio three times—once as Treasurer and twice as Secretary of State. He has also served as mayor of Cincinnati, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, and member of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform. He is the first African-American to be elected to statewide executive office in Ohio. In 2008, he served as a vice-chair of the Republican National Convention Platform Committee. Blackwell is a best-selling author, serves on the boards of directors of the Club for Growth, the National Taxpayers Union and the National Rifle Association. He is also a member of the executive committee of the Council for National Policy and chairman of the Ohio Faith and Freedom Coalition.
"Ken Blackwell has been a strong, conservative leader in the Republican Party for many years, and I am honored to have his endorsement," said Gov. Perry. "His support will be instrumental to this campaign and I look forward to partnering with him as I travel the nation to share my vision to get America working again."
