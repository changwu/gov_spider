    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send you the first Annual Report of the National Council on Educational Research as required by Public Law 92-318, Title III (Section 405(c)(3)(f) of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended).
The Council is the policy-making body of the National Institute of Education which was created by the Congress to provide national leadership in the conduct of educational research and development.
I remain committed to a strong Federal role in research and development in education and to support the National Institute of Education and the National Council on Educational Research as the primary vehicles responsible for the Federal role. The Institute is now well advanced in its program directed toward specific and pressing educational problems.
The National Council on Educational Research is providing guidance to the Institute during the development of this program.
I know that the Congress will join with the Administration in supporting and strengthening the National Institute of Education and in encouraging the National Council on Educational Research to continue providing the vigorous policy direction and advice which will assist the Institute to meet its goals
