.@Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter. "We have a different policy than Twitter on this. I believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online." Did Twitter criticize Obama for his "you can keep your Dr."?Retweets: 38191Favorites: 160701

I can't stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.....Retweets: 71586Favorites: 314258

Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!Retweets: 69355Favorites: 272975

"The President has been targeted by Twitter." @MariaBartiromo What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff, and so many others, on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus, Plus, Plus? What about China's propaganda? WHO's mistakes? No flags? @foxandfriendsRetweets: 40674Favorites: 146501

"Regulate Twitter if they are going to start regulating free speech." @JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends Well, as they have just proven conclusively, that's what they are doing. Repeal Section 230!!!Retweets: 34334Favorites: 130755

Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means....Retweets: 54305Favorites: 254284

....It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!Retweets: 32182Favorites: 165444
