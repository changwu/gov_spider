    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Condit (D) CA and 91 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3534. The Administration recognizes the value of the additional analytical information called for by the bill. The Administration is concerned that by failing to consider the benefits of legislation that protects human health, safety, the environment, or the Nation's economic well-being, the bill creates an imbalanced procedural obstacle to the enactment of legislation in the public interest.
The Administration is especially concerned about the amendment added to the bill that would establish a point of order on the use of user fees and revenues. This amendment could delay or undermine funding for a number of well-established and important programs and laws that have traditionally received bipartisan support, including airline air traffic and ground safety, the Superfund program, the Senate-passed version of the IRS reform bill, and legislation under consideration that provides relief to tobacco farmers and additional resources for public health and health research.
