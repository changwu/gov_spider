    Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Crown Prince Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia. He will be remembered around the world for his extraordinary half-century of service to the Saudi people as Minister of Defense and Aviation. Saudi citizens also benefitted greatly from his philanthropy at home, which funded housing and medical care for the Kingdom's neediest citizens and scientific research on water and desertification, among other important causes. In the United States, he will also be remembered as a friend and champion of the close, decades-long partnership between our two countries. From my earliest days in the Senate, I have had the honor to work with Prince Sultan, King Abdullah, and other distinguished members of the Saudi royal family to enhance this important relationship. I join President Obama and all of our Administration in offering our condolences to the royal family and the people of Saudi Arabia.
