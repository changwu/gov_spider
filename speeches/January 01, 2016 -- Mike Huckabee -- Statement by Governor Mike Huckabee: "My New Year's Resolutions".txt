    I resolve that the next time a Silicon Valley billionaire or an A-list Hollywood star praises socialism, I will suggest that he give half his money to me.
I resolve to offer a warm, reassuring hug to anyone traumatized by any non-P.C. comments I might make, but at the same time not to provide any "safe space" from the First Amendment.
I resolve to get through the final year of Obama's assault on freedom with the confidence that we can stop it and turn it around.
I resolve to keep pointing out that all those climate change conferences involving dozens of fuel-guzzling private jets flying to far-flung luxury destinations could easily be conducted via Skype.
And, seriously: I resolve to keep bringing up the shameful treatment of our veterans every chance I get until we have an administration that treats them as the heroes they are!
