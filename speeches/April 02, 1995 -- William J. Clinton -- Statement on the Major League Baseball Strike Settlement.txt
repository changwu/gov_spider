    Today's decision is good news for the game of baseball, its fans, and the local economics of the cities where baseball is played.
While I am heartened to know this season will start with major league players, there are a number of underlying issues which still need to get resolved. I strongly urge the owners and players to meet and reach full agreement at the bargaining table so that another season won't be in jeopardy.
