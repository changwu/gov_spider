    I join the American people in extending my best wishes to all who celebrate Portugal Day, also known as the Day of Camoes, Portugal, and the Portuguese Communities. The United States and Portugal enjoy a strong friendship built upon common values, and our two nations continue to work together to promote peace, stability, and development around the world. While this day marks the passing of Portugal's greatest poet, Luis Vaz de Camoes, it is also a day to recognize and celebrate Portugal's history and accomplishments. Here at home, Portuguese Americans have greatly contributed to our Nation, adding their culture and heritage to our own.
