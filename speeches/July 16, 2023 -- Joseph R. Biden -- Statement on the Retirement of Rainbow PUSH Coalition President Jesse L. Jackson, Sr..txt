    The promise of America is that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. While we've never fully lived up to that promise, we've never fully walked away from it because of extraordinary leaders like Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr.
Throughout our decades of friendship and partnership, I've seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. Whether on the campaign trail, on the march for equality, or in the room advocating for what is right and just, I've seen him as history will remember him: a man of God and of the people; determined, strategic, and unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation.
Jill and I are grateful to Reverend Jackson for his lifetime of dedicated service and extend our appreciation to the entire Jackson family. We look forward to working with the Rainbow PUSH Coalition as he hands the torch to the next generation of leadership, just as we will continue to cherish the counsel and wisdom that we draw from him.
