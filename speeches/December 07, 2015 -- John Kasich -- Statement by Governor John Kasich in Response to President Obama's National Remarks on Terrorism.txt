    STATEMENT: Gov. John Kasich's Response to President Obama's National Remarks on Terrorism
Tonight, Ohio Governor John Kasich issued the following statement in response to President Obama's remarks on the recent terrorist attacks:
"The President's strategy is not enough. Without taking the fight to ISIS on the ground, ISIS won't be defeated. Since February I've been calling for a coalition to do that. We must stop delaying and do it. We delayed in helping the Syrian rebels and look where it got us, and when we decided to act it was too little. Bolder action across the board is needed because our way of life is what's at stake. Also, when terrorists threaten us, our response can't be to target our own constitutional rights. Our rights aren't the problem, our unwillingness to act to defeat extremists is the problem. We need to decisively and aggressively protect our nation and our ideals. We can't delay."
