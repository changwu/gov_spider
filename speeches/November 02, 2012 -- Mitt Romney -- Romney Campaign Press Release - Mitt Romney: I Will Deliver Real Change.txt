MITT ROMNEY: "Now, how is it that [President Obama] has fallen so far sort of what he promised? In part, it's because he never led before, never worked across the aisle, never truly understood how jobs are created in the real economy. And so today he makes new promises, promises he'll be unable to keep because he admits he's going to stay on the same path. The same course we've been on will not lead to a better destination, Mr. President. The same path means $20 trillion in debt. It means crippling unemployment, stagnant take-home pay, depressed home values and a devastated military. Unless we change, we may be looking at another recession. The question of this election comes down to this: Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? Now President Obama promised change but he couldn't deliver it. I promised change and I have a record of achieving it. I actually built a business and I turned around another business. I helped put an Olympics back on track. And with a Democrat legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay. That's why I'm running for president. I know how to change the course the nation is on."
