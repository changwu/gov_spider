MORRISTOWN, NJ - As Governor Chris Christie returns to New Hampshire this week to officially file for the First In The Nation primary ballot and hold town hall meetings in three counties, ten more New Hampshire community leaders announced they are joining his campaign's leadership team.
"Governor Christie has demonstrated strong leadership by taking on the special interests in his state and defending taxpayers against public employee unions. After eight years under a President who had no experience as an executive before entering the Oval Office, we need a leader with Governor Christie's experience to take on the tough fights in Washington and restore America's role as a respected superpower around the world," stated Ken Hawkins, a former Bedford state representative, U.S. Marine Corps veteran, and former President of the New Hampshire Jaycees.
