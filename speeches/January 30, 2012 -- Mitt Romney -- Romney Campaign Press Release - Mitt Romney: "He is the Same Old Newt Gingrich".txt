Mitt Romney on "Fox and Friends":
Mitt Romney: "Well, I guess the question is what are those big ideas that he's battling for? We keep hearing him talk about fundamental change and big ideas. What are they? A colony on the moon? I frankly think that's not the kind of big idea America is looking for. I think we want to get jobs here. I think people understand that someone like myself understands how the economy works and I'll get jobs here and I'll work very hard to strengthen our economy. I also believe that people recognize the government is too big. I've laid out a plan that cuts back on the scale of government. I've taken $500 billion a year out of government spending and laid out how I'm going to get that done. The Speaker continues to go from state to state to state to promise more and more money, whether it's the moon colony here in Florida. Whether it's the new interstate corridor in South Carolina. A new VA hospital in New Hampshire. He is the same old Newt Gingrich. What you're seeing on TV as you see him flail around and attack me is exactly what you saw back in the 90's which led to him being reprimanded and ultimately, if you will, pushed out of the Speaker position by his own fellow Republicans."
