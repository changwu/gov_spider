    I am today signing Senate Joint Resolution 236, relating to cooperative East-West ventures in space.
Space represents a challenging opportunity for the United States and for all of mankind—a challenge that, I am determined, we will meet. We stand today on the threshold of a great adventure. Beyond are vast opportunities—for the production of new materials, new medicines, and the expansion of our knowledge of the universe and of ourselves.
This must be a cooperative effort. We have worked with many other nations in our own space program, and this cooperation will strengthen and grow. Many countries have taken part in the successful Spacelab program, and I have invited other nations to take part in the development of a space station.
I find portions of the language contained in the preamble to the joint resolution very speculative. However, I have stated several times our desire to increase contacts with the Soviet Union, and we are prepared to work with the Soviets on cooperation in space in programs which are mutually beneficial and productive. As part of this effort, the United States has offered to carry out with the Soviet Union a joint simulated space rescue mission. We believe this and similar cooperative programs offer practical benefits for all mankind. It is in that spirit that I today sign this joint resolution.
