    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Alice Marie Johnson. In 2018, the President commuted Ms. Johnson's sentence in light of her hard work and rehabilitation while in prison, including model behavior for more than two decades and mentorship to her fellow inmates.
Ms. Johnson, a 65-year-old great-grandmother, served nearly 22 years in Federal prison for a first-time, non-violent criminal offense. While incarcerated, she completed numerous training and education courses, volunteered in a hospice, contributed her talents to art and theater programs, and held steadfast to her Christian beliefs. Although sentenced to life with little hope for freedom, Ms. Johnson nonetheless worked to better herself, those around her, and her community.
Since President Trump commuted her sentence, Ms. Johnson has shared her story of redemption and has worked with lawmakers on landmark criminal justice reform efforts. Her selfless commitment to serving others since her release sets an exceptional example for our Nation's citizens, especially for those seeking to rejoin their communities after prison. For these reasons, Alice Marie Johnson is well-deserving of this pardon.
