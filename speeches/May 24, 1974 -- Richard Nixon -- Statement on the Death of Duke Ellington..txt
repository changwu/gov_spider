    ONE of the most memorable dates of my first term as President was April 29, 1969. On that day Edward Kennedy Ellington, better known to generations of Americans as Duke, celebrated his 70th birthday by coming to the White House to accept the first Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by my Administration.
The wit, taste, intelligence, and elegance that Duke Ellington brought to his music have made him, in the eyes of millions of people both here and abroad, America's foremost composer.
We are all poorer because the Duke is no longer with us. But his memory will live on for generations to come in the music with which he enriched his Nation.
