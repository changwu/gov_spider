    Today, President Donald J. Trump released the National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel and the National Strategy for Aviation Security. In keeping with his promise to protect the American people and our interests, these strategies prioritize vital roles and responsibilities for departments and agencies. The strategies also establish and clarify planning and operations coordination requirements to keep terrorists from transiting our borders and enhance security in our aviation sector.
President Trump is committed to protecting Americans and the Nation's aviation ecosystem. He has made it clear that his Administration will do what it takes to keep America safe. These strategies – the first of their kind in more than a decade – articulate how he is keeping that promise.
The National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel modernizes the approach of the United States to countering a complex and evolving terrorist threat. The National Strategy for Aviation Security is the overarching framework for a comprehensive, coordinated, integrated, and layered national approach to protecting American aviation from recognized threats.
These strategies direct the United States Government to take steps to address longstanding security challenges and strengthen our Nation's ability to address emerging threats and deter terrorists seeking to travel. Together, they will strengthen border security, enhance vetting, improve enforcement of our immigration laws, and bolster transportation security in America and around the world.
