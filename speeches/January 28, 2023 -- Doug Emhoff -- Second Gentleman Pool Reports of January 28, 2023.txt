SGOTUS travel pool report #1 - comments on Jerusalem attack
Good morning from Krakow, where it is gray and below freezing.
The Second Gentleman gaggled after a tour of the Oskar Schindler Enamel Factory in Krakow. He answered a question about last night's shooting attack at a Jerusalem synagogue that killed 7 people.
"This is a terror attack. This is murder."
"These were people who were just prayingin a temple, living their everyday lives, and were murdered in cold blood."
"It's something that we need to just stop. And that's why we're doing this work. And that's why I'm gonna continue to do this work."
"We stand with the people of Israel. We're committed to the security of Israel."
He said he spoke about the attack with the VP and that President Biden has spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu.
More details to come on his engagements for the day.

SGOTUS travel pool report #2 -- antisemitism roundtable and Schindler's factory
SGOTUS arrived at the Oskar Schindler Enamel Factory at 9:57 a.m. CET this morning. He was greeted by the deputy mayor of Krakow and the museum director. (See below for all names and background on locations.)
Halfway through the tour, SGOTUS walked into an exhibit about "Schindler's List," the 1,000 Jews saved by the German businessman in the Holocaust. SGOTUS spent a minute pausing in the room and reading some of the names.
At the end of the tour, SGOTUS signed a guestbook in front of photos of the Jews saved by Schindler. After, he spoke about his visit to Auschwitz yesterday and took two questions from press. Some quotes below (see previous email for quotes on Jerusalem attack).
"It's something I'm never going to forget. And it's going to help me continue to do the work."
"What are we seeing today, we cannot have history repeat itself. And that's why, on behalf of the administration, we are taking this so seriously as an all of government approach to push back on hate and antisemitism."
Motorcade departed the museum at 11:30 a.m. for the Galicia Jewish Museum, where SGOTUS is participating in a roundtable about antisemitism.
At 11:56 a.m. SGOTUS entered the museum and delivered remarks for 10 minutes at the start of the roundtable. One quote below, and WH will send his prepared remarks later today. Press were escorted out of the meeting, which is closed press.
"Before I left on this trip, I spoke to President Biden and Vice President Harris about this. The president spoke to me in the Oval Office about how his own father spoke to him about the horror of horrors of the Holocaust."

Press did not see SGOTUS again at the last stop after the introductory remarks at his antisemitism roundtable. Pool held at a nearby restaurant during roundtable.
SGOTUS arrived at a UNHCR community center at 2:58 p.m. He and Ambassador Brzezinski received a briefing on UNHCR's work in the country, focused on the last 11 months since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 1.5m Ukrainian refugees have registered with the Polish government in that time, said Kevin Allen of UNHCR.

At 3:23 p.m. SGOTUS walked into a large room where elderly Ukrainian women were eating cookies and doing crafts. (Many were painting eggs.) SGOTUS first walked up to a group of children and asked them what game they were playing.
He stopped and chatted with the women for several minutes, talking with them about where they met and what they were doing for work in Poland. SGOTUS did not take questions from the press. See quotes below from his conversation with the women.
"I'm going to talk about you with the vice President as soon as I talk to her."
"On behalf of President Biden and Vice President Harris, who's my wife, and our great ambassador here I just want to let you know the United States is going to do everything we can to continue to support the Ukrainian people."
The motorcade departed back to the hotel at 3:42 p.m. Pool split off from SGOTUS, who will speak to staff of the U.S. Consulate General in Krakow, which is closed press.
