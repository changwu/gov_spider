    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement regarding sanctions for Iran's Central Bank:
"Iran's support for terror, assassination and nuclear proliferation demand tough U.S. sanctions against Iran's Central Bank to cripple the regime's access to the international economy.
"Tonight's bipartisan action in the U.S. Senate is a strong step in the right direction. President Obama should stop excusing Iran's dangerous behavior and drop his opposition to these strong economic sanctions against the rogue Iranian regime.
"Earlier this evening, the U.S. Senate voted 100-0 to penalize foreign financial institutions that do business with Iran's Central Bank, the main conduit for Iran's oil revenues."
