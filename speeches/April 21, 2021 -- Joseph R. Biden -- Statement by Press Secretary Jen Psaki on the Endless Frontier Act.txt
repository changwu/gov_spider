    We welcome the bipartisan introduction of the Endless Frontier Act – one more encouraging sign of the bipartisan support for investing in America's competitiveness. The President shares the co-sponsors' commitment to making a bold investment in American innovation—including large increases in funding at the National Science Foundation to support both R&D and commercialization, and new funding to support regional economic development so what is discovered in America can be made in America. And, the President welcomes the bill's focus on strengthening American supply chains – an issue he has taken action on and championed. We look forward to working with Congress to further shape this legislation to renew America's global leadership in science and technology and to make sure we develop and manufacture the technologies of the future.
