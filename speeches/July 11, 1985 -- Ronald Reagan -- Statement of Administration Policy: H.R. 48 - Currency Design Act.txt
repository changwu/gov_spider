    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Annunzio (D) Illinois and Roth (R) Wisconsin)
Although the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 48, it does not believe the legislation is necessary.
H.R. 48 would require the Treasury Department to notify the Congress at least 90 days in advance of its intention to change the design of United States currency. The Treasury Department already consults with the Congress on changes in currency design and will continue to do so.
