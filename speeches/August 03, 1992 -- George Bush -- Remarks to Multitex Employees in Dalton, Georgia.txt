    We wanted to come down here and see the tremendous job that Dalton does in selling product all over the world. Don't tell me the United States can't compete when you see a place like this. We are number one. You know, the guy I'm running against called America the laughingstock, or said that we were ridiculed around the world. Let me tell you something: The United States is the leader of the entire world, the most respected country on the face of the Earth. So don't let these pessimists start downgrading our great country.
Now, here's my view. I love this political rally, but I've got a confession to make. I've said that until our convention in Houston I'm going to hold back a little bit. But I'll tell you something: I can't wait for that convention to be over. It's going to be strong. It's going to be good. And then I am going to set the record straight.
For 6 months the opposition has been distorting a good, solid world leadership record, and we're not going to let that stand. So to all you Georgians who believe you can accomplish things, who are demonstrating right here in Dalton to the rest of the world what the American worker can do: Stay in there and help me. We are going to win.
Thank you very, very much.
