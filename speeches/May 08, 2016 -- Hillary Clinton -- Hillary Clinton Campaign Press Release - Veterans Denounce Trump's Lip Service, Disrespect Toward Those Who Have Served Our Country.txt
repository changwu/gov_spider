    Today, former Republican presidential nominee and war hero Sen. John McCain called on Donald Trump to apologize for his disdain for the brave men and women who have served our country. Echoing that call, more than 50 veterans released a joint statement urging Trump to start showing respect for veterans, including immediately donating the millions of dollars that he allegedly raised in their name months ago, which remain unaccounted for:
"Donald Trump recently discovered a new love for America's veterans, promising that a Trump administration will 'treat them really, really well.' Yet after a publicity stunt earlier this year when he ditched a GOP debate to hold an event on behalf of veterans, his campaignstill hasn't distributed more than half of the $6 million dollars it allegedly raised. Theydon't even know where that money has gone. And worse, this is part of a long pattern of the real Donald J. Trump, who for over a decade tried to get disabled veterans, legally operating as street vendors, thrown off of Fifth Avenue in New York City. Hesaid that these Americans, who were simply trying to earn a living in the country they gave so much to defend, were 'clogging and seriously downgrading the area.'"
"And yet, even as Donald Trump denigrates our nation's current veterans, he's putting our future veterans at risk with a risky and incoherent foreign policy. Republican andDemocratic national security professionals agree that a Trump administration would make America dangerously less safe while reducing its standing and influence in the world. His embrace of both military adventurism and isolationism, and his support of the use of torture will not only recklessly place our troops in harm's way, but will dramatically increase the risk to our service members serving in operations overseas. Trump's policies are detrimental to the young men and women who volunteer to serve this country, from the moment they join the armed services to the end of their career, civilian or military. He can't be trusted, by our veterans or anyone else."
"It's time for Donald Trump to stop using vets as political props, donate the rest of the money he raised and build a real understanding of the needs and concerns of the men and women who have served America."
