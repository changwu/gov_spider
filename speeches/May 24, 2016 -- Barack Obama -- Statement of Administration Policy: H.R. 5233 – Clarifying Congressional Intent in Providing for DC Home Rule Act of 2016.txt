(House Rules)
(Rep. Meadows, R-NC, and Rep. Harris, R-MD)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5233, which would repeal the District of Columbia's Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012. The Administration strongly supports home rule for the District and the President has long called for authority allowing the District to spend its own local taxes and other non-Federal funds without congressional approval.
The Administration is disappointed that the Congress has failed to provide elected leaders in the Nation's capital the most basic authority to spend local tax collections without congressional approval, an authority held by local officials across the Nation. Subjecting the District to the lengthy and uncertain congressional appropriations process for its use of local tax collections imposes both operational and financial hardships on the District, burdens not borne by any other local government in the country. The residents of the District and their elected leaders deserve to have the same ability as other U.S. residents and elected leaders to determine how to use their local revenues to address their unique needs. Such authority is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy, and the Congress denying the District this authority is an affront to the residents and elected leaders of the District.
If the President were presented with H.R. 5233, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
