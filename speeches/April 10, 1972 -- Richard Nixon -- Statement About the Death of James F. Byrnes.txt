    JAMES F. Byrnes was one of those men who ranked principles first--and that should be his legacy to all of us who seek to serve our country.
No man in American history has held so many positions of responsibility in all branches of our Government with such distinction. He was a great patriot who always put his country ahead of his party.
Governor Byrnes acted always for the best interests of the United States of America, as he saw those interests from the solitary viewpoint of his personal conscience.
He was trained as a lawyer, began his public service as a solicitor, and became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
He was also a legislator, representing the people of South Carolina in the Congress for 24 years. He served the executive branch of the Federal Government with particular distinction, as "Assistant President" and Secretary of State. And he then returned to his beloved home State of South Carolina to serve its people as Governor.
America was served exceedingly well by this distinguished South Carolinian who became one of the dominant American statesmen and political leaders in the turbulent years that bridged the new eras spawned by two world wars and the tensions and realignments resulting from each.
I, for one, was always grateful that I could seek his wise counsel. I will miss it now that I cannot.
Mrs. Nixon joins me in expressing deepest sympathy to Mrs. Byrnes.
