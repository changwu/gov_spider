    The Clinton campaign today announced that Traci Otey Blunt has joined the communications team as the director of African American media.
"We are excited to have Traci join the communications team because she brings experience in several areas, most importantly working with African American media, as well as her experience working with leaders in the African American community at the local, state, and national level," said Howard Wolfson, campaign communications director.
Over the last 15 years, Traci's professional experience has included work on behalf of local, state, and federal political candidates and elected officials in Tennessee and the District of Columbia; associations; and PR agencies. Most recently, Traci served as a vice president and deputy director for the multicultural practice, overseeing the African American portfolio, at Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide in DC.
"I am thrilled to be a member of Senator Clinton's campaign and to be able to work with a group of smart and talented people," said Blunt. This is an historic time and to have the opportunity to work with the media to demonstrate Senator Clinton's commitment, experience, and understanding of issues that matter to the African American community are what I am proud to do," said Blunt.
