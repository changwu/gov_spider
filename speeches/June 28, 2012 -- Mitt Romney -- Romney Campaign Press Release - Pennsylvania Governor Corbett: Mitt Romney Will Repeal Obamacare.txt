    Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's ruling by the Supreme Court to uphold President Obama's healthcare law is disappointing. If implemented, we will be saddled with a nearly $2 trillion entitlement. The Supreme Court's decision sets the stakes for the November election. Now the only way to save the country from this massive government takeover of healthcare is to elect a new President and lawmakers in Washington, D.C. We need a leader who understands that free markets and competition lead to better quality, greater access and lower costs for our healthcare. We need a leader who understands that real healthcare reform shouldn't be a burden to taxpayers or come at the cost of American jobs. That leader is Mitt Romney."
