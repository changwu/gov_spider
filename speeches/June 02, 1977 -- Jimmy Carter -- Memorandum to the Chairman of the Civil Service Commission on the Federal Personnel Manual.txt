    To Chairman Campbell
It has been brought to my attention that Chapter 410, subchapter 8, paragraph 4 of the Federal Personnel Manual, entitled "Nonparticipation in Segregated Meetings or Conferences," addresses only discrimination based on race.
It is this Administration's policy that Federal officials should not participate in private conferences or meetings held in facilities which discriminate on the basis of sex, religion, or national origin, as well as race. Accordingly I request that you take whatever action is appropriate to amend the above cited provision to reflect this policy.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Alan Campbell, Chairman, Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C. 20415]
