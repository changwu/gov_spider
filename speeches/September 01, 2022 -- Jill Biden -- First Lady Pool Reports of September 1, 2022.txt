Passing along the following:
Background from the Office of the First Lady:
Today, First Lady Jill Biden, Secretary Marty Walsh, and Secretary Gina Raimondo will speak at an event launching the Apprenticeship Ambassador Initiative, a national network of more than 200 employers and industry organizations, labor organizations, educators, workforce intermediaries, and community-based organizations who are committed to strengthening and diversifying Registered Apprenticeship.

The Apprenticeship Ambassadors have existing Registered Apprenticeship programs in over 40 in-demand industries and have committed to expand and diversify these programs over the next year by collectively accomplishing the following:

develop 460 new Registered Apprenticeship programs across their 40 industries
hire over 10,000 new apprentices

 Following remarks from the First Lady, Secretary Walsh, and Secretary Raimondo, there will be a panel discussion with members of the initiative. The panel will be led by Brent Parton, Acting Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training Administration at the Department of Labor, and will include Carla Grant Pickens of IBM, Darren Hawkins of Yellow Corporation, Brent Booker of NABTU, Portia Roberson of Focus: HOPE, Julian Alvarez of the Texas Workforce Commission, and Dr. Mary Thornley of Trident Technical College.
Additional background on the First Lady's engagement and support of the role community colleges play in workforce development:

In Boston, Massachusetts, the First Lady and Secretary Walsh met with union workers and paid interns from Bunker Hill Community College at Eversource Station 99, an electrical substation that services the Seaport District of Boston, to highlight a partnership between the community college, two unions, and the local public utility company and underscore the critical importance of these kinds of training opportunities to implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
In Chandler, Arizona, the First Lady met with Maricopa County Community College District students and staff at Intel's Ocotillo campus to showcase how the American Rescue Plan helps invest in job training, and how companies can partner with local community colleges to expand access to good-paying jobs.
In Reno, Nevada, the First Lady met with students at Truckee Meadows Community College to see their hands-on learning programs in nursing, emergency medical services, and radiologic technology, and to highlight how the American Rescue Plan has helped community colleges continue their efforts to build a strong, local, and diverse workforce.
