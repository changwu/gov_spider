  A Proclamation

Whether they tap their feet to the spirited sound of bluegrass or quietly hum along with the soulful melodies of traditional ballads, millions of Americans -- and, indeed, fans around the world -- enjoy listening to country music each day. However, country music is more than a favorite source of entertainment; it is also a rich and colorful expression of the hopes, experiences, and values of the American people.
Encompassing a wide range of musical genres, from folk songs and religious hymns to rhythm and blues, country music reflects our Nation's cultural diversity as well as the aspirations and ideals that unite us. It springs from the heart of America and speaks eloquently of our history, our faith in God, our devotion to family, and our appreciation for the value of freedom and hard work. With its simple melodies and timeless, universal themes, country music appeals to listeners of all ages and from all walks of life.
The popularity of country music, both throughout the Nation and throughout the world, is a great tribute to generations of talented American composers, musicians, lyricists, and singers. This month, we gratefully acknowledge their many gifts to us and proudly celebrate the uniquely American art form that is country music.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 603, has designated October 1990 as "Country Music Month" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 1990 as Country Music Month. I invite all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN VITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifteenth.

GEORGE BUSH
