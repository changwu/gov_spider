    Senator Danforth has made considerable progress in helping to bring both sides in Sudan's peace process closer to the negotiating table. I am grateful for Senator Danforth's efforts, and I have asked him to continue to serve as my envoy. The road ahead will be difficult. Lives continue to be lost, and conditions for the people of Sudan are hard.
Achieving peace will require verifiable action by both sides. We must see deeds, not just words. The Government of Sudan cannot make empty promises while continuing to wage war against its own people. It must stop interfering with food deliveries. It must stop attacking civilians. It must honor fully its commitments to Senator Danforth. It must accept that it cannot win the war. It must seek peace.
The United States is committed to helping the aggrieved people of the Sudan. We will continue to urge the parties toward peace at the talks in Kenya. To achieve a lasting and just peace, all parties at the talks must make every effort to ensure the discussions are a success.
