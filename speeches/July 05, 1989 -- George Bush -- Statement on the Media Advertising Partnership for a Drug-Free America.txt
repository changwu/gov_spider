    I welcome the news that the Media Advertising Partnership for a Drug-Free America is increasing its educational efforts against the use of illegal drugs. The partnership, under the leadership of Jim Burke, has pledged to increase its level of donated advertising to a value of $1 million a day by September 1, 1989.
This private effort delivered approximately $150 million last year in donated time and space for advertising aimed at reducing the demand for illegal drugs. Such voluntary support from the media to help educate the American people about the dangers of drug abuse will have a significant and positive impact, as we work together to overcome this insidious problem.
