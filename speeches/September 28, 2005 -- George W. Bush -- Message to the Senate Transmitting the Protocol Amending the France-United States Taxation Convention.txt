    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed at Paris on August 31, 1994 (the "Convention"), signed at Washington on December 8, 2004 (the "Protocol"). Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol was negotiated to address certain technical issues that have arisen since the Convention entered into force. The Protocol was concluded in recognition of the importance of U.S. economic relations with France.
The Protocol clarifies the treatment of investments made in France by U.S. investors through partnerships located in the United States, France, or third countries. It also modifies the provisions of the treaty dealing with pensions and pension contributions in order to achieve parity given the two countries' fundamentally different pension systems. The Protocol makes other changes to the Convention to reflect more closely current U.S. tax treaty policy.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Protocol and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
