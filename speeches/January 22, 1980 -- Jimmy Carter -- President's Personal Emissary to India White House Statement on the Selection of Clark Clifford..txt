    The President has asked Clark Clifford to go to India as his personal emissary to continue with the new Indian Government the dialog we have had with India over the years. Prime Minister Gandhi has welcomed this proposal and Mr. Clifford will meet with her on January 31.
The selection of Mr. Clifford, a senior adviser and personal friend of the President, underscores the importance that President Carter attaches to continuing good relations with India and his concern with the situation in Southwest Asia.
We expect that the discussions between Mr. Clifford and Prime Minister Gandhi and other senior Indian officials will cover a broad range of international, regional, and bilateral issues.
