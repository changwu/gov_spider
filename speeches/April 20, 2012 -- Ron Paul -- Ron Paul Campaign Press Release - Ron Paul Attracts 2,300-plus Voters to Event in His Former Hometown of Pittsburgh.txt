LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted a remarkable 2,300-plus voters to a town hall meeting in his native city of Pittsburgh.
News articles from earlier today cite Steel City residents recalling that Dr. Paul served as a high school student council president, and that he was a track star.
Dr. Paul held his town hall meeting at 7:00 p.m. ET in the University of Pittsburgh's Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, located at 4141 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh, PA 15213. The symbolism of the venue's name was apparent as Ron Paul, a former Air Force flight surgeon, is the only veteran seeking the Republican nomination for the presidency, or the presidency for that matter.
At the event the 12-term Congressman from Texas discussed his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the restoration of our economic and civil liberties, and provisions of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America.'
