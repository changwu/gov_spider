    The President. I wanted to take this opportunity publicly to thank you for Germany's wonderful cooperation and financial contribution as well as many other things during this Desert Storm. I understood from day one the German position, and we had very close consultations with the Chancellor. I know that you were in touch with Secretary Brady and others, and I am grateful for the financial support, but even more for the understanding. It's not just restricted to Desert Storm; it goes over into the role you all are playing in terms of working out cooperatively the Polish debt. I don't think Germany gets enough credit for having been very, very understanding about that -- --
Q. Going to get any money back?
The President. -- -- and other areas of cooperation. So please extend my best to the Chancellor and wish him well.
The Finance Minister. Thank you very much. And I want to congratulate to the great success not only for your country but for the whole of the world, as it was very important for us. We are very happy with you.
Q. Mr. President, is there going to be any left over from the contributions?
The President. I am confident that the Minister and Secretary Brady have understanding on the costs involved, and I'm very grateful to Germany for their participation in all of this, as I am to other friends and allies. I'm afraid it's not going to be any cheaper, if that's what you mean, than original estimates.
Thank you all very much.
