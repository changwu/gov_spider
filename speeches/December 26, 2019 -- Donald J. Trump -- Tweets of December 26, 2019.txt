Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the House be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes there was no crime the call with Ukraine was perfect with 'no pressure.' She said it must be 'bipartisan....Retweets: 2355Favorites: 9025

....& overwhelming' but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also very unfair with no Due Process proper representation or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren't alowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!Retweets: 1460Favorites: 5584

'Look the House is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents BEFORE they send the articles over to the Senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents - that work is supposed to be done in the House.' @KatiePavlich @foxandfriendsRetweets: 16834Favorites: 69394

The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats said they wanted to RUSH everything through to the Senate because 'President Trump is a threat to National Security' (they are vicious will say anything!) but now they don't want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly. Liars!Retweets: 24074Favorites: 105085

At least 51 Republican Senators would agree with that-there should be no trial.'Retweets: 18735Favorites: 75685

Nancy Pelosi's District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad so fast - she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor Gavin Newsom it is a very sad sight!Retweets: 30619Favorites: 120850

'Nancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate. Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House and she has no standing in the Senate.' Brad Blakeman. Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District & help the homeless there. A primary for N?Retweets: 23148Favorites: 93472

Despite all of the great success that our Country has had over the last 3 years it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders (and others) when I am having to constantly defend myself against the Do Nothing Democrats & their bogus Impeachment Scam. Bad for USA!Retweets: 28598Favorites: 124572

'Nancy Pelosi is trying to usurp the Constitutional role of the Senate. The longer this goes on the more petty partisan & political it all looks.' @KarlRove @FoxNews Just more of the same from the Do Nothing Dems. Nancy should be helping the record number of homeless in her D!Retweets: 15990Favorites: 61753

California leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population - two terrible stats. Crazy Nancy should focus on that in her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem!Retweets: 29396Favorites: 129707
