    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Heflin (D) Alabama and 3 others)
The Administration supports enactment of S. 663. This bill would authorize NASA to provide for the payment of contingent liability in excess of available appropriations for a privately-financed Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM). Without this authority, NASA would be required to delay the ASRM program significantly and incur substantial additional costs. The ASRM program is a necessary and critical element in increasing the safety, reliability, and performance of the Nation's manned space flight activities.
