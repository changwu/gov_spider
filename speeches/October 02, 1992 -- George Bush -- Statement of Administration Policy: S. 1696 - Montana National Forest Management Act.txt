    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Baucus (D) MT and Burns (R) MT)
The Administration opposes House passage of S. 1696, as reported by the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The Administration supports S. 1696, as passed by the Senate. During further Congressional consideration of the bill, the Administration will seek the following amendments:

—   Eliminate the Federal reservation of water rights for wilderness purposes.
—   Strengthen the provision to "release" for multiple-use management those roadless areas not designated as wilderness under the Forest Service's management plan. This would exclude from judicial review the initial decisions in the Forest Plans to recommend certain areas for wilderness designation and allocate others for multiple-use management. Such release language would be consistent with S. 1696, as passed by the Senate.
—   Modify certain wilderness areas to be more consistent with S. 1696, as passed by the Senate.
