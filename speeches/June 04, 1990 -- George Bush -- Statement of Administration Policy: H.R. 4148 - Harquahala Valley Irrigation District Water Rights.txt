    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Udall (D) Arizona and four others)
The Administration has no position on H.R. 4148 at this time. The bill leaves unanswered many questions concerning its scope and costs and how it relates to several pending Arizona Indian water rights settlements. The Administration will seek to address these concerns during Senate consideration of H.R. 4148 and other legislation to settle related Indian water rights claims for the Ft. McDowell Indian Community.
