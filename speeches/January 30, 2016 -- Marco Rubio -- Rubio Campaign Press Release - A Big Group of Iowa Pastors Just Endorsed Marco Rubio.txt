This morning, a new group of Iowa pastors endorsed Marco, adding to his momentum just two days before the state caucuses.
Philip Herman, Pastor at Fellowship Community Church in Norwalk says it was hearing Marco's personal testimony that pushed him over the edge:
I am enthusiastically supporting Marco Rubio because I have personally heard him share how his belief in God impacts the things he believes in and stands for. Our country doesn't need another leader who simply wants to be President for his own personal power and ego, we need a leader like Marco Rubio who uses his gifts and abilities in full submission to an Almighty God.

Cory Van Sloten, Pastor of Lebanon Christian Reformed Church in Sioux Center, added:
As a Christian, a Pastor, and a Veteran, I believe Senator Rubio is best qualified to lead our nation for such a time as this.

Eric Teetsel, Marco's Director of Faith Outreach, touted the announcement:
Marco is honored that Christian leaders throughout the state representing a diverse array of theological traditions believe he is the best choice for president.

Marco understands religious liberty to be a cornerstone of our society and our country's founding, marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and the inherent dignity of every human life from the moment of conception, and pastors from across Iowa will be supporting and helping Marco at Monday's caucuses.
