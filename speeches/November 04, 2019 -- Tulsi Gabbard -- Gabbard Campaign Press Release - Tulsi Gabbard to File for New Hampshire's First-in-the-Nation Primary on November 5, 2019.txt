    MANCHESTER, N.H. â€” Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (U.S. Rep, Hawaii) will be at the historic New Hampshire State House to officially file for the Granite State's first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday.
Tulsi's campaign remains focused on her vision for ending our engagement in costly regime change wars, the new Cold War and arms race, and investing US resources in serving the needs of the American people.
Congresswoman Gabbard will be accompanied by relatives of 9/11 victims from New Hampshire who will join her in calling for Congress to pass HRS 662, requiring the Trump administration to declassify all information regarding Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks.
