    Let me just thank all the members of this advisory committee and, particularly, our Secretary and Governor Kean and Lud Ashley. We've got a topflight commission. Earlier on with the leadership of Secretary Kemp, we set a goal for the administration, one million new homeowners by the year 1992. Jack tells me that we've got a good start on that. I think it's some 650,000 new, and low- and moderate-income homeowners to date. And that's at a time when the economy hasn't been all the best for a lot of people out there.
But if we want to have affordable housing for all -- and that's certainly our objective and goal -- we've got to confront this problem of regulation and excessive redtape, the bureaucracy in times interfering. And these are obstacles that make it difficult to construct housing for low-income families.
So, that's why our Secretary and this Commission have focused on the maze of bureaucratic barriers. And I'm very anxious to get a detailed report from everybody here about how it's going. But again, I want to end by thanking you, Governor, and Lud; of course, our Secretary and other key members of all this who devoted a lot of time to studying how we can make housing more affordable. It is a worthy national goal, and we've got to succeed. And I commend Jack and others at HUD on the start, but we recognize it's just the beginning.
So, thank you all for coming.
