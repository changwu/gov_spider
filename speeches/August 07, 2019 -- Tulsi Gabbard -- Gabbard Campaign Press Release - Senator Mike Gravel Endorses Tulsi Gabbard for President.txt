    NEW YORK — Mike Gravel announced today that he is endorsing Tulsi Gabbard and her campaign for president. 
"I'm pleased to officially announce that Tulsi Gabbard has my endorsement for President of the United States of America in 2020 , " wrote Senator Gravel. "The Congresswoman is the most qualified and prepared candidate to serve as Commander in Chief, which I believe is the most important responsibility of the President."
He continued: "I believe Tulsi is the only candidate with the experience, conviction and motivation to get us out of costly regime change wars and end the new Cold War and nuclear arms race. Congresswoman Gabbard is the only candidate that can unify our country and defeat Donald Trump in 2020.
I encourage everyone who, like me, wants to bring about a future with peace, prosperity and justice for all, to donate to Tulsi Gabbard's campaign for President at: www.Tulsi2020.com"
Tulsi's campaign for the White House recently burst through the threshold of 130,000 unique donors required to participate in the Democratic debates. Her underdog campaign is building momentum and attracting supporters across the country.
