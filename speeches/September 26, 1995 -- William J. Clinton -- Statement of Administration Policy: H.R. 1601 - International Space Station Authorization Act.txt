    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Walker (R) PA and Sensenbrenner (R) WI)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1601 and recommends that the bill be amended as described below. The bill authorizes multi-year appropriations for remaining development, assembly, and initial operations of the International Space Station. This timely, multi-year authorization of appropriations will assist in ensuring the Station's successful completion and deployment. The Administration supports the concept of a stable, multi-year commitment to funding for the Space Station Program in the context of an overall stable, balanced NASA multi-year budget plan consistent with the President's FY 1996 Budget.
The Administration recommends deletion of the provision in section 5 of the bill that would require the location of spacecraft engineering and astronaut training at one NASA center. This would interfere with NASA's discretion to effectively manage its programs.
