Pocahontas (the bad version) sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024 far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her 'DNA test is useless.' Even they don't want her. Phony!Retweets: 28140Favorites: 121754

Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her 'a person of color' (amazing con) and would not have taken her otherwise!Retweets: 22831Favorites: 91857
