    We condemn in the strongest terms the Government of Iran’s apparent plans to move forward in executing Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. The lack of transparency and due process in Ms. Ashtiani’s case, and the subsequent actions taken against her lawyer and family, are unacceptable. Her case demonstrates the Government of Iran’s fundamental disregard for human rights, including those of women. We call on the Government of Iran to stop this execution, and provide Ms. Ashtiani with the due process and fair treatment she deserves.
