    Mr. President and distinguished guests:
Let me say with great emphasis my appreciation for your warm hospitality and that of the Romanian people. It has been a wonderful experience for Mrs. Ford and myself to meet so many of your people, and it has been a glorious opportunity for me to not only see Bucharest but this superb area of your country where we are today.
I am especially grateful for the opportunity to have friendly, constructive, and frank discussions with you, not only on our bilateral relations but those problems that we see on a worldwide basis.
For the last several years, Mr. President, you have taken the leadership in bringing about an exchange in the area of culture, scientific matters, economic problems between your country and our country, and the net result has been mutually beneficial to both.
The documents that we have just signed make possible the kind of trade relationship between your country and mine that will enhance the prosperity of both, make the life of your people and mine richer, and will be beneficial on a worldwide basis.
What I have signed on behalf of my country has received the endorsement of our Government--the executive, the legislative--and therefore, it is a true contract between your country and my country for all of the benefits that we can share equally.
I thank you again, and I thank the Romanian people.
