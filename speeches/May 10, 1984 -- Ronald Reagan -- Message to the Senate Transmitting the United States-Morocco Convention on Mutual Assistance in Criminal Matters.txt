    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Morocco on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Rabat October 17, 1983.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the treaty.
The treaty is one of a series of modern mutual assistance treaties being negotiated by the United States. The treaty is self-executing and utilizes existing statutory authority.
The new treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual assistance available under the treaty includes: (1) executing requests relating to criminal matters; (2) taking of testimony or statements of persons; (3) effecting the production, preservation of documents, records, or articles of evidence; (4) serving judicial documents; (5) facilitating the appearance of a witness before a court of the requesting Party; (6) locating persons; and (7) providing judicial records, evidence, and information.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
