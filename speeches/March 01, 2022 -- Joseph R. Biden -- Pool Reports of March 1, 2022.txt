Print pool report #15: POTUS trip to Wisconsin, background embargoed
Attached and below is a background memo ahead of the President's trip to Superior, embargoed until Wednesday at 5:00 AM.
BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM
TO: Out-of-Town Travel Pool
FROM: White House Press Office
DATE: March 2, 2021
RE: Background on BIL for the President's Visit to Superior, Wisconsin
The Blatnik Bridge
The Blatnik Bridge is a bridge that connects Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin across the St. Louis Bay. This bridge is a critical link for the community and local economy with more than 33,000 vehicles travelling across the bridge each day.
Built in 1961, this bridge has deteriorated and is nearing the end of its usable life. Due to the bridge's condition, load restrictions have been instituted, setting the maximum weight of vehicles passing the bridge at 40 tons and prohibiting the passage of large trucks and other heavy-weight vehicles from travelling across the bridge.
The Blatnik Bridge represents a critical first- and last-mile connection to the Port of Duluth-Superior. The Duluth-Superior Port is North America's largest fresh-water, transportation hub for moving domestic and international freight. The port facilities trade across a wide range of industries, including agriculture, forestry, mining and manufacturing, construction, and power generation.
The Blatnik Bridge also represents a critical piece of infrastructure in the event of an emergency, as the bridge is the major route of egress between these two communities. The bridge played an important role in 2018 when there was a major explosion at refinery in Superior which caused widespread evacuations to the Duluth area.
If the Blatnik Bridge's main trusses (structural beams) are not replaced in the next 10 to 15 years, there will need to be more load restrictions, increased inspections, maintenance, and lane closures. Without intervention, this would eventually lead to the reduction to a single lane in each direction, followed by a full bridge closure, and finally bridge demolition. This outcome would have a profound impact on the local economy and the thousands of residents in the Duluth-Superior region who depend on this bridge on a daily basis.
Wisconsin has 979 bridges in poor condition and Minnesota has 661 bridges in poor condition.
Over the next five years, based on formula funding alone, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will provide Minnesota an estimated $4.8 billion and Wisconsin an estimated $5.4 billion for roads and bridges.
Wisconsin and Minnesota plan to dedicate some of their formula funds to replace the Blatnik Bridge. They also plan to apply for competitive grant funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help fund this project.
Bridge Investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver for Wisconsinites and Minnesotans by rebuilding roads and bridges and creating good-paying union jobs.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes a total of $40 billion in funding for bridge investments. This includes the $27.5 billion in bridge formula funding for states to repair, repair, and rehabilitate bridges. The President announced the first year of funding under this Bridge Formula Program in January. The law also includes a $12.5 billion for a competitive grant program, called the Bridge Investment Program, which is focused on replacing the most economically significant bridges in the country.
Regionally or nationally significant bridges could also be eligible for funding under additional Department of Transportation grant programs focused on major projects, including the "INFRA" program and "MEGA" program.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Duluth-Superior Region
The Duluth-Superior region is already benefiting from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's investments. In addition to the large sums of formula funding that has already been announced for Wisconsin and Minnesota, there are a number of other projects in the Duluth-Superior region that will be funded by Bipartisan Infrastructure Law:
‚Ä¢ St. Louis River & Great Lakes Restoration Initiative: Earlier this month, the President and EPA Administrator Regan announced $1 billion of investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to accelerate cleanup and restoration of the Great Lakes. One of the largest beneficiaries of this funding is expected to be the St. Louis River Area of Concern which encompasses the Duluth-Superior region. The project will help to drain 3,634 square miles of watershed, thereby helping to improve water quality, protect coastal habitats, and support shipping and trade.
‚Ä¢ Port of Superior & Port Infrastructure Development Program: In December, the Department of Transportation (DOT) awarded $8.4 million in funding to the Port of Superior through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. This funding will help to make critical infrastructure improvements to the port, which is a major cargo hub in the Midwest. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided an additional $2.25 billion to the Port Infrastructure Development Program. DOT recently opened the next round of applications for $450 million of funding through this program.
‚Ä¢ Army Corps Projects: In January, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced $14 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other funding to upgrade ports and waterways and improve climate resilience with over 500 projects across 52 states. Several of these projects will benefit the Duluth-Superior region, including a $12 million investment for the Duluth Harbor basin to reconstruct a dock wall and a $479 million investment to rebuild the Soo Locks which connect Lakes Superior and Huron and enable the passage of the nearly 7,000 vessels which pass through the locks annually.
