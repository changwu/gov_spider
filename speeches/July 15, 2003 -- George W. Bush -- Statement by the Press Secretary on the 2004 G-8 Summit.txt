    United States Hosting 2004 Group of Eight (G-8) Summit in Sea Island, Georgia
President Bush will host the 30th G-8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia on June 8-10, 2004, after the United States assumes the Presidency of the G-8 from France at the beginning of 2004.
The G-8 Summit brings together the Leaders of the world's major industrial democracies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union also attends the G-8 Summit, represented by the President of the European Commission and the Leader of the country holding the Presidency of the European Council. At previous G-8 Summits, Leaders have discussed a wide range of international economic, political, and security issues.
Sea Island is located on the southernmost portion of the Georgia coastline. The city of Savannah will host some members of country delegations, as well as the domestic and international press corps.
Previously, the United States hosted G-8 Summits in Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico (1976); Williamsburg, Virginia (1983); Houston, Texas (1990); and Denver, Colorado (1997).
