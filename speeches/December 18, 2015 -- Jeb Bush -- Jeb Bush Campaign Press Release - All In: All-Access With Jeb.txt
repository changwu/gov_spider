    "It's a chance to be able to say what you think. And I'm going to take advantage of that." — Jeb Bush

On November 3, Jeb headed out on a three-day trip across New Hampshire, determined to shake every hand and answer every question. His mode of transportation: a black bus with four words on the side — "Jeb Can Fix It."
Jeb didn't waste a second on the 72-hour swing. He won over a group of women at a diner who jumped out of the car because they saw his bus. He made his case to a swing voter in a hotel lobby. And connected with a veteran in Wolfeboro after a strong exchange on national security. No moment was too small, no issue off limits.
Jeb can fix it. And on this trip, he showed how and why.

"Do you record him all the time?" — Berthy de la Rosa-Aponte
What a bus lacks in conventional luxury, it certainly makes up for in closeness. Thanks to that, it was the perfect environment for some all-access filming. The cameras stayed rolling as Jeb met Granite Staters, spoke candidly about the state of the race and shared a couple of late-night laughs.
Joining Jeb on the bus are longtime friends like Berthy de la Rosa-Aponte, who met Jeb after he took an interest in learning about the challenges faced by Berthy's special needs daughter, Lucy.
This is a rare inside look into the strength and commitment that drive Jeb on the campaign trail.
