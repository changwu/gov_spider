    Today, Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"This moment, and the road ahead of us, demands someone with experience, empathy and compassion - someone who's led through crisis before and knows what good governance looks like. As we face COVID-19, now, more than ever, American families and businesses are looking for measured, principled leadership in the White House. I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for President because I am confident he is that leader we need. Joe has a track record tailor-made for the crisis we face. He's experienced tragedy. He's presided over economic recovery. He knows grief. And he knows the White House. On March 3, I watched Joe win the Democratic primary here in Texas. Now I'm excited to help him turn the Lone Star State blue and win Texas in November. "
Vice President Biden won the Texas primary on March 3. Congressman Cuellar also joins more than 50 Texas endorsers, including former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, Congressional Black Caucus members Eddie Bernice Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Colin Allred; Congressional Hispanic Caucus members Sheila Jackson Lee, Veronica Escobar, Sylvia Garcia, Filemon Vela, and Vicente Gonzalez; Austin Mayor Steven Adler and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner; as well as Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Carol Alvarado and State House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner.
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
