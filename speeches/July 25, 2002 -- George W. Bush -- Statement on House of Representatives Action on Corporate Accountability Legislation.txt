    I commend the House of Representatives for its overwhelming bipartisan passage of reforms to hold corporate America accountable. This legislation will protect investors, crack down on fraud and wrongdoing, and provide tough oversight of the accounting industry. Leaders in Congress heeded the call to put the interests of investors and employees first. I look forward to prompt action by the Senate so that I can sign this important legislation into law.
