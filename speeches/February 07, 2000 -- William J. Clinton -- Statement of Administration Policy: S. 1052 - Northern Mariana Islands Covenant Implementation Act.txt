    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Murkowski (R) AK and three others)
The Administration supports S. 1052, as reported, which would implement further the Act approving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States of America. Specifically, S. 1052 would extend the Immigration and Nationality Act to the CNMI with special provisions to allow for the orderly application of national immigration law with consideration for the local economy in this newest U.S. territory. The Administration believes that S. 1052 represents a significant positive step forward that will improve immigration policy by guarding against exploitation and abuse of individuals. The Administration appreciates the bipartisan commitment reflected in S. 1052 and looks forward to working with the Congress to address certain remaining concerns with new provisions of the bill. The Administration also looks forward to addressing other serious problems with the CNMI's foreign worker economic system, such as the wage structure and the use of the "Made in the USA" label, that are not addressed in S. 1052.
