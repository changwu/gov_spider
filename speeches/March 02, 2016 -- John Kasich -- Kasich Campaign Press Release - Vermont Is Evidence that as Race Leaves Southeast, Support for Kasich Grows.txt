    Governor John Kasich tonight is running neck-in-neck with Donald Trump in Vermont, a clear sign that as the campaign moves on from the Southeast, Gov. Kasich will further expand his support. He is already positioned to be the only Republican able to stop Donald Trump and win the White House in November.
As part of its consistent campaign plan, Kasich for America strategically targeted time and resources in Vermont while gearing up for its big push in the Midwest. As a result, Kasich outperformed both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz proving that as more people hear Kasich's positive, solutions-driven message, his path to the nomination will solidify.
As the campaign moves to battleground states, the Kasich campaign strategy grows stronger. John Kasich is the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in Ohio, which is critical to stopping him. At the same time, Rubio has no path to beating Trump in his home state of Florida. Additionally, John Kasich is the only candidate who currently leads Hillary Clinton in Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire and Virginia.
The Kasich for America strategy is working because experience and authenticity matter. While other candidates are throwing mud and bringing down the dignity of the office they seek to hold, Gov. John Kasich is putting his ideas first, standing behind his proven compassionate and conservative record and listening to the American people. That will continue to be our focus and mission going forward.
