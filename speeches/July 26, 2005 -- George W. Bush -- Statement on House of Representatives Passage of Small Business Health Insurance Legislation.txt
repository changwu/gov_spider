    I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the "Small Business Health Fairness Act," which will increase the availability of Association Health Plans. AHPs are a fair, innovative, and commonsense approach to make health insurance more affordable and accessible, one of my top domestic priorities. By letting small businesses join together to buy insurance at the same discounts big companies get, this bill will help workers and their families have more health care choices and obtain greater savings. This change is overdue, and I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and pass this good legislation this year.
