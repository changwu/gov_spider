During tonight's ABC News debate, Marco was asked about what defines conservatism. Watch his amazing answer:

To sum it up, being a conservative is about three things:
1. Conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level. If it's not in the Constitution, it doesn't belong in the federal government.
2. Conservatism is about free enterprise. It's the only economic model that can make poor people richer without making rich people poorer.
3. Conservatism is about a strong national defense. The world is safest when America is the strongest nation in the world.
It's clearer every day that Marco is the conservative who can beat Hillary Clinton.
