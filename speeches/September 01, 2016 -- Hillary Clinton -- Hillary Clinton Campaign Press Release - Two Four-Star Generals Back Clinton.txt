    In a joint statement, two Four Star Generals, Bob Sennewald and David Maddox are endorsing Hillary Clinton for President. Sennewald is the former Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces Command, and Maddox was formerly Commander in Chief, U.S. Army-Europe. Clinton spoke at the American Legion on Wednesday:
"Having each served over 34 years and retired as an Army 4-star general, we each have worked closely with America's strongest allies, both in NATO and throughout Asia.  Our votes have always been private, and neither of us has ever previously lent his name or voice to a presidential candidate.  Having studied what is at stake for this country and the alternatives we have now, we see only one viable leader, and will be voting this November for Secretary Hillary Clinton."
