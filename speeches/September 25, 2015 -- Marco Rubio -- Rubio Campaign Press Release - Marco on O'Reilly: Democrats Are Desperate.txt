Marco on Debbie Wasserman Schultz's attempt to smear a Republican supporter as a Nazi sympathizer:

It didn't surprise me, I've been watching Debbie Wassermann Schultz for years in Florida. . . . It is a despicable attack. . . . Even liberal media outlets have criticized her for doing that. Don't expect an apology— they just move on, they don't feel like they are accountable to anybody for it.
But I think it is also indicative of the levels of desperation that have now entered the Democratic party. Their frontrunner is in a lot of trouble, as we've been seeing in the news over the last few days. This is further sign of the sort of desperation that they're now facing — panic, really.
On what he thinks we need to see from the Republican nominee:

We need to have someone who is a serious person, someone who is serious about the future of our country, someone who understands the challenges we face. This election isn't about any of us individually. It's about the United States of America at one of the most critical times in its history, both geopolitically and domestically here with our economy. We need someone who has real thoughts and depth on these issues that our country's facing.
