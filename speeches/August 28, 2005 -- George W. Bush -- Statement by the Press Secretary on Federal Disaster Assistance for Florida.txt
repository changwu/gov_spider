    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Florida and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by Hurricane Katrina beginning on August 24, 2005, and continuing.
Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis in the counties of Broward and Miami-Dade for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance.
For a period of up to 72 hours, Federal funding is available at 100 percent of the total eligible costs for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance. The period of up to 72 hours at 100 percent excludes debris removal.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named Justin DeMello as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that more counties and additional forms of assistance may be designated after damage assessments are fully completed in the affected areas.
