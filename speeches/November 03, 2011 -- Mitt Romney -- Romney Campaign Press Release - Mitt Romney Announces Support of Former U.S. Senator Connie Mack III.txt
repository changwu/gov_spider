    Mitt Romney today announced the endorsement of former Florida Senator Connie Mack III. Senator Mack will serve on the campaign's National Advisory Council.
"I am honored to receive Senator Mack's support," said Mitt Romney. "He has long been a champion in the fight to reduce our deficit and balance the budget. Senator Mack's service to Floridians is long and distinguished and I am thrilled to work with him to spread my pro-growth message of reduced spending, a balanced budget, and job creation."
"Mitt Romney's conservative experience is unmatched," said Senator Mack. "He spent his career in the private sector turning around failing businesses and creating jobs. As Governor, he turned around his state, turning a $3 billion budget gap into a $2 billion rainy day fund, all without raising taxes. Mitt Romney will provide America the leadership we need to fix our economy, put Floridians and all Americans back to work, and return us to a new era of prosperity and opportunity. I am proud to support Mitt Romney for president."
