    Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.
That's been the work of my first term: To fight for our Democracy. This shouldn't be a red or blue issue. To protect our rights. To make sure that everyone in this country is treated equally. And that everyone is given a fair shot at making it.
But, you know, around the country, MAGA extremists are lining up to take those bedrock freedoms away. Cutting social security that you've paid for your entire life while cutting taxes for the very wealthy. Dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. All while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.
When I ran for President four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are. The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.
I know what I want the answer to be and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent.
That's why I'm running for re-election.
Because I know America. I know we are good and decent people. I know we are still a country that believes in honesty and respect, and treating each other with dignity. That we're a nation where we give hate no safe harbor. We believe that everyone is equal, and that everyone should be given a fair shot to succeed in this country.
Every generation of Americans has faced a moment when they have to defend democracy. Stand up for our personal freedom. Stand up for the right to vote and our civil rights.
And this is our moment.
So if you're with me, go to JoeBiden.com and sign up. Let's finish this job, I know we can.
Because this is the United States of America. And there's nothing, simply nothing, we cannot do if we do it together.
