    The news from Tokyo of an agreement on beef and citrus products was most welcome. Ambassador Yeutter, our Trade Representative, advises that agreement was reached to eliminate Japanese import quotas on beef and citrus products. I am pleased that Prime Minister Takeshita's government has joined us in liberalizing agricultural trade. We made tough choices in order to open these markets. This important achievement strengthens the U.S.-Japan relationship and demonstrates our mutual commitment to an open trading system.
