    Today I am pleased to receive from the Department of Commerce the first data released from Census 2000, our country's 22d decennial census. I congratulate Secretary Norman Mineta, Secretary William Daley, and Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt for their leadership in Census 2000, the longest continuous scientific effort in American democracy. Since 1790, these data collected during each decennial census help to tell the ongoing story of America, its rich heritage and broad diversity. Most importantly, I want to thank the American people for their participation in Census 2000. With their help, the country is better equipped to meet the needs of every American and the challenges in the 21st century.
