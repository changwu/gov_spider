    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I transmit herewith the 11th Annual Report of the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers fiscal year 1994.
Promoting democracy abroad is one of the central pillars of the United States' security strategy. The National Endowment for Democracy has proved to be a unique and remarkable instrument for spreading and strengthening the rule of democracy. By continuing our support, we will advance America's interests in the world.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
