    CONCORD, NH — Tulsi Gabbard wrapped up successful campaign events in Freedom, Durham, and Dover on Day 3 of her New Hampshire tour this week and is the first 2020 presidential candidate to visit West Ossipee. Her campaign's momentum is building with a busy public events schedule, growing audiences, meetings with community leaders and county Democrats, town halls with residents and university students, and interviews with local journalists at every stop across the state.
While in Freedom during New Hampshire's Maple Weekend—a time when proud maple producers show off their farms, operations, and most importantly, their maple syrup—Tulsi visited a local sugar house, toured their maple processing facility, and shared her legislative efforts to address climate change, which threatens New Hampshire's maple market.
Today's Rochester Meet and Greet and Plaistow Town Hall will conclude the public events schedule of Tulsi Gabbard's New Hampshire visit this week, followed by interviews with local independent media journalists.
