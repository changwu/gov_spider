    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee today announced that Jim Dyke and Michael McKeon will join the Committee as senior communications advisors. Dyke and McKeon will bring their invaluable expertise in government, campaign and private sector communications to the Committee.
During the 2004 cycle, Dyke served as Communications Director of the Republican National Committee, where he spearheaded a successful communications strategy that helped re-elect President George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 election, Dyke served as Press Secretary for the RNC and Press Secretary and Spokesman for U.S. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans. Dyke has been a guest on numerous local and national radio and television shows. He currently resides in Charleston, South Carolina and is President of the communications consulting firm Jim Dyke and Associates.
McKeon, a partner of Mercury Public Affairs, served as Senior Advisor and Communications Director to Governor George Pataki. McKeon played a central role in Governor Pataki's 1998 election and was chief spokesman for the successful 2002 re-election campaign. In addition to advising on major policy and strategic decisions for Pataki, McKeon was responsible for overseeing the state's crisis communications. In the days following September 11, McKeon coordinated the activities of Governor Pataki and Bush administration officials and also oversaw development of the "I Love New York" ads. Prior to joining the Pataki administration, Mr. McKeon worked for more than 10 years as a reporter for three New York newspapers.
"Jim and Michael will play an integral role in the campaign as we continue to communicate the Mayor's proven record and optimistic vision for the future. We are thrilled to have them as part of our team," Committee Communications Director Katie Levinson said.
