    Yesterday marked 70 years since the formation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and as President, I am honored to mark this important anniversary. Since its formation in the wake of World War II, the CIA has served as the first line of defense in confronting the foreign challenges facing our country. The CIA's intelligence has long shaped our foreign policy in steering a safe and steady course for our Nation.
Today, CIA officers help our Government confront the full range of threats to our Nation's security, including from terrorists, rogue states, weapons proliferators, transnational criminal organizations, and malicious cyber actors. Through it all, they resolutely protect our citizens as well as our friends throughout the world.
I proudly salute the brave men and women of the CIA who serve as America's silent heroes, quietly strengthening our national security and often putting their lives on the line. Their sacrifice ensures that America and our allies live in a safer, more prosperous, and free world. May God bless the United States of America and all the courageous men and women who serve her.
