    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of former Democratic National Committee Chairman John White. Our prayers are with Nellie and his family at this difficult time. I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with him and learn from him. His decency, perseverance, and humor are a model for all of us who face the challenges and possibilities within our political system to move ideas forward and improve people's lives. John dedicated his life in service to the Democratic Party and this Nation. As Democrats gather from across the country to formally elect new leadership this weekend, memories of his sharp wit and tireless commitment will be in our hearts.
