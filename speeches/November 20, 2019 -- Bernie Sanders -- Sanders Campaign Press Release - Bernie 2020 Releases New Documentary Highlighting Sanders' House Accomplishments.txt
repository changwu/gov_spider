    WASHINGTON – Ahead of tonight's Democratic debate, Sen. Sanders' presidential campaign on Wednesday released a short documentary looking back at his time serving in the House of Representatives.
"Tonight you will hear people on the debate stage question whether Bernie's vision is achievable," Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. "But it's clear from his record that the senator knows exactly how to make change – no matter how difficult the political environment."
The film, titled "The Amendment King," chronicles the senator's achievements passing amendments, defending Vermont's farmers and taking on huge corporations like IBM.
The House of Representatives was under Republican control for 12 of the 16 years Sanders served.
"Bernie's work in the nineties earned him the term 'Amendment King,'" Vermont Lieutenant Governor Dave Zuckerman said. "He was so effective at bringing together coalitions to support the needs of all Vermonters."
