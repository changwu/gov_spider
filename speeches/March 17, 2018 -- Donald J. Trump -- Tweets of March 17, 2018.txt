Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!Retweets: 47996Favorites: 165233

As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice & State. #DrainTheSwampRetweets: 31757Favorites: 115876

The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks?
