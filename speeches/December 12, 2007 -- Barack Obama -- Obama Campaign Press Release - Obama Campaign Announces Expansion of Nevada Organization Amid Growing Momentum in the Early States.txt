    Obama for American campaign to open three new offices in Nevada bringing total number to 10
Las Vegas, NV-- On a conference call with reporters this afternoon, David Plouffe, Obama's national
campaign manager, announced the opening of three additional offices in Nevada. The new campaign
offices in Henderson, Boulder City, and Winnemucca will bring the total number to ten across the
state, more than twice the number of offices of any other presidential candidate.
"This campaign's strength is based on our incredible volunteers," said Plouffe. "The new offices
will support the grassroots organization that we have built in every corner of Nevada and will allow
for supporters from many communities to take part in the campaign on the ground level."
Already up and running are regional offices in Carson City, Reno, Elko, Pahrump and three in Las
Vegas.
Plouffe also noted the growing momentum for Barack Obama in all four early nominating contests.
"The tightening of the race we are seeing in the early states reflects the strength of the Obama
campaign's grassroots organization and the growing momentum for Senator Obama's candidacy," said
Plouffe. "Our campaign's focus will remain on building the strongest precinct-level grassroots
organization in Nevada, reaching out to potential caucus-goers and getting them active in their
communities."
