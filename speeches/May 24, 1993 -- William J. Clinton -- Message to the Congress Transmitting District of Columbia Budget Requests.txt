    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Government's 1994 budget request and 1993 budget supplemental request.
The District of Columbia Government has submitted a 1994 budget request for $3,389 million in 1994 that includes a Federal payment of $671.5 million, the amount authorized and requested by the Mayor and City Council. The President's recommended 1994 Federal payment level of $653 million is also included in the District's 1994 budget as an alternative level. My transmittal of the District's budget, as required by law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the 1994 appropriation process.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House,
May 24, 1993.
