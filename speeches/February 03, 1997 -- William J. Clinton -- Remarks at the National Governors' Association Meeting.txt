    Good morning, Governor Miller, Governor Voinovich; good morning to all the Governors who are here. It was wonderful to see all of you last night, and I'm glad to welcome you back to the White House.
This is an unusual opportunity for our country and for every State. The Nation is strong; we are at peace; we have extraordinary prosperity. But we know we're living through a time of great change in the way we work, in the way we live, the way we relate to each other, that there are significant challenges which if not faced will have destructive consequences for our Nation in the years ahead. So as we stand on the edge of this new century and this profoundly new era, we have a unique opportunity and a common responsibility, which is to take action together to try to prepare this country not just for the next 4 years but for the next 50 years.
In the State of the Union Address tomorrow night, I'm going to lay out the challenges that I see not only for the President and the Congress but also for the States and local communities and private citizens. Because there will be a great deal in that speech about the States and the issues of education and welfare reform and other issues of common concern, I want to invite any of you who can stay, to stay tomorrow night and to come into the Chamber of the Capitol and sit as a group, as many as would like to stay, and be there at the State of the Union Address.
I know that many of you have concerns about welfare reform or Medicaid spending or education, the environment, transportation. I'm looking forward to addressing those concerns, beginning today at this meeting but also every day for the next 4 years. I want every one of you to feel that you can always call this White House and that you will have someone, even if we don't always agree, who understands your concerns and will do his best to address them. And I thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
