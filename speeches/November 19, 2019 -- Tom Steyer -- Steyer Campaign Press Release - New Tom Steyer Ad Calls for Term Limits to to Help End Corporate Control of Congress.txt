(SAN FRANCISCO, November 19, 2019) — Today, presidential Democratic candidate Tom Steyer rolled out a new ad calling for term limits in Congress to put power back in the hands of the American people. This comes after Mr. Steyer pushed for term limits and a national referendum last night on the Daily Show with Trevor Noah.
The ad is part of Steyer's Structural Reforms agenda. It comes as part of a campaign wide commitment highlighting how Tom's the only candidate in the race talking about bold reforms such as term limits and a national referendum to increase voter participation, end business as usual in Washington, and break the corporate stranglehold on our government.
The ad will air locally in all four early primary and caucus states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. The campaign is also running digital ads.
"Members of Congress –– and the corporations who've bought our democracy –– hate term limits," Steyer said in the ad. "We need term limits –– because Congress shouldn't be a lifetime appointment. The only way we get universal health care, address climate change, and make our economy more fair is to change business as usual in Washington."
See below for full script: 
I'm about to say two words that will make Washington insiders very uncomfortable:
Term Limits.
You and I both know we need term limits... that Congress shouldn't be a lifetime appointment.
But members of Congress –– and the corporations who've bought our democracy –– hate term limits.
Too bad.
I'm Tom Steyer, and I approve this message.
Because the only way we get universal health care, address climate change and make our economy more fair is to change business as usual in Washington.
