    "I congratulate the Make It Right project, which is presenting designs today for 150 new environmentally-friendly homes to be built in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward. And that's just the beginning. Make It Right is creatively confronting two of the challenges that I identified when I laid out my Gulf Coast Recovery Agenda in May: the need for affordable housing and the need for environmentally sustainable development in New Orleans. Make it Right, like so many other private organizations and community and church groups, is doing its part to move the Gulf Coast further on the path of recovery.
But while the American people continue to step up, the Bush Administration continues to fail the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. When I am President, I will call on citizens to help rebuild New Orleans and the region â€“ and I will make the government a true partner in the effort to complete the road to recovery. Because rebuilding this city is not a New Orleans obligation or a Louisiana obligation - it is an American obligation."
