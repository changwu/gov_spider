    The United States strongly condemns today's terrorist attack on checkpoints in Egypt's North Sinai Governorate, which killed at least nine people and injured many others. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of all those who were killed and injured in this attack and in other recent violence. The United States remains firmly committed to Egypt's security and will continue to support the Government of Egypt as it contends with ongoing threats from terrorist groups in the Sinai and elsewhere.
