    Dole/Kemp '96 Press Secretary Nelson Warfield released the following statement today:
"Bill Clinton's speech was unbelievable -- literally, unbelievable.
"Tonight, voters should remember to ask themselves this: Would you buy a used tax cut from this man? After all, he promised a tax cut in 1992 and broke his word. Why would anyone believe him in 1996?
"It's ironic that Bill Clinton talked about so many bridges because his speech was the political equivalent of trying to sell the, Brooklyn Bridge. Voters won't buy it."
