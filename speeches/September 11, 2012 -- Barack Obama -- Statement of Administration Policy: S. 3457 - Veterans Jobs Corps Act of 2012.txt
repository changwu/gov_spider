(Senate)
(Senator Nelson, D-FL, and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3457, which would create a Veterans Jobs Corps to help the Nation's returning veterans find pathways to civilian employment and to protect and rebuild America. The President first proposed the Veterans Jobs Corps in his 2012 State of Union address, to help Afghanistan and Iraq veterans get jobs when they come home.
Senate passage of this bill is consistent with the Administration's commitment to honor the Nation's veterans and help the country's separating service members successfully transition to the civilian workforce. Many of these veterans returning home have been unable to find suitable employment commensurate with their training and experience from over ten years of war. Furthermore, America's public lands face enormous unmet infrastructure and facility maintenance needs, and this country's veterans have the skills to meet these demands. Veterans will leverage skills developed in the military in jobs on the country's public lands and in its communities, ranging from conservation and infrastructure projects to law enforcement and first responder jobs, such as park rangers, police officers, and firefighters. The Veterans Jobs Corps will help tens of thousands of veterans back to work by investing $1 billion over the next five years, to provide these employment opportunities in a manner that is fiscally responsible.
The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to support the Nation's veterans.
