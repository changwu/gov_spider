The Sioux City Journal, a major conservative voice in northwest Iowa came out over the weekend and urged Iowans to support Marco:
Articulate, informed and personable, Rubio delivers winning performances on the campaign trail and in GOP candidate debates. For us, his rise from humble roots inspires and his optimistic, positive message resonates. ...
From life to the Second Amendment to smaller government and less government spending to Obamacare to border security to national security, Rubio meets the conservative test. The Heritage Action for America conservative scorecard, in fact, gives him a 94 percent rating.
The Sioux City Journal endorsed both Republican candidates against Obama and have a long history of backing conservatives.Just one week until the Iowa Caucus, and Marco's momentum is building.
