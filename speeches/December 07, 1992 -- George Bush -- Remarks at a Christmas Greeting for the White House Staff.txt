    Don't dare move my hands -- [laughter] -- what I wanted to do -- [laughter]. No, but I am very grateful to Dana and to Paula for being here. And Dana's given me a lot of laughs. He said to me on the phone, "Are you sure you really want me to come there?" [Laughter] And I said yes. And he said, "I hope I've never crossed the line." I knew exactly what he meant, and as far as I'm concerned, he never has. The fact that we can laugh at each other is a very fundamental thing. I'm not sure on November 4th that the invitation would have gone out and then had the same enthusiasm. [Laughter] But we're shifting gears. And I think he's given us a wonderful kickoff to what I hope will be a joyous, totally friendly, very happy, somewhat nostalgic but merry Christmas for everybody.
In a few minutes, Barbara shows the press through this spectacular house that we've been privileged to live in for 4 years. And we wanted to share with some of you -- I wish we could have had everybody -- the majesty of this place, which I hope many will get to see in these various receptions and all. But I think there's something special seeing it for the first time when it's just beginning.
So let me take this opportunity once again to thank Dana Carvey for brightening our lives, giving us a little joy, and wish each and every one of you a Merry Christmas. And we can never adequately say thanks for all you've done for us, for your country, and for the Bush family.
Thank you so much, and God bless you.
