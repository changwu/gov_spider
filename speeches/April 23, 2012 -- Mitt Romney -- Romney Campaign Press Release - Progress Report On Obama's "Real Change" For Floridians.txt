    "Nearly four years after promising Floridians they would bring 'real change,' the Obama-Biden team is back in Florida today. But with a record of high unemployment, falling wages, and skyrocketing gas prices, voters won't be fooled by the same broken promises and empty rhetoric this time around. President Obama's campaign team says the American people will judge him on his record - and unfortunately for the President, they are right." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

Now, more than ever, this campaign has to be about the problems facing the American people - because this is a moment of great uncertainty for America. The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression. ...
