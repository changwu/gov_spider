    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kennedy (D) Massachusetts and three others)
Although the Administration supports the reauthorization of the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant, as contained in H.R. 1861 as reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, it opposes the enactment of S. 1579 because it would authorize appropriations far in excess of those contained in the President's FY 1989 Budget.
S. 1579 authorizes appropriations of $401 million during FYs 1988-90; this is $139 million or over 150 percent of the levels contained in the President's FY 1989 Budget.
