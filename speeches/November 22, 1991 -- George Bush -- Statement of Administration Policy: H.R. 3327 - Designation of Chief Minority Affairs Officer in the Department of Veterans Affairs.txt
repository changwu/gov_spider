    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) MS and Rangel (D) NY)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3327. The bill would centralize under a newly designated Chief Minority Affairs Officer the responsibility for the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) minority outreach efforts. These functions are already being implemented through VA's regional and local facilities, which are in the best position to determine the needs of minority veterans. H.R. 3327, therefore, would result in costly duplication of these current efforts.
