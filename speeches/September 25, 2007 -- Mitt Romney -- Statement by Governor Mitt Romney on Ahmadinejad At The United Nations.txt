Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's remarks at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly:
"Today's General Assembly address by Iran's President Ahmadinejad represents a failure of the United Nations to live up to its founding principles. Ahmadinejad has threatened the extinction of another member state, Israel. He not only speaks of genocide, but is pursuing a nuclear program that will provide him with the tools of genocide. Iran's treatment of women and minorities is abominable, as is its support for terror.
"Sadly, the Democratic presidential candidates have failed to strongly speak out against the UN's and Columbia University's decision to host Ahmadinejad's propaganda tour, in spite of the regime's record of human rights violations and the threat they pose to the world. We must continue to work to isolate Iran, just as we did with Apartheid South Africa, in order to bring about change."
