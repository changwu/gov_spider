    Hogsett Will Serve As A Chair Of Indiana Campaign
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Indiana Secretary of State Joseph Hogsett and named him a Chair of Hillary's Indiana campaign.
"The people of Indiana are ready for change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it from her first day in the White House," Hogsett said.
Hogsett served as Secretary of State from 1989 to 1994, cutting the office's budget every year while improving performance. His "doing more with less" philosophy resulted in national awards for the office's corporations division, and his securities division's crack down on unscrupulous stockbrokers and lenders increased protection for Hoosier consumers.
After his tenure as Secretary of State, Hogsett served as chief of staff and senior adviser to Governor Evan Bayh from 1995 to 1997. He later served as Chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party from 2003 to 2004.
Hogsett currently practices law at Bingham McHale in Indianapolis.
"I am honored that Joe will help lead our efforts in Indiana," Clinton. "With his help, we'll bring our message of change across the Hoosier State and the nation."
