    Mitt Romney today announced his Minnesota State Finance leadership team.
"I am proud to announce my Minnesota State Finance leadership team," said Mitt Romney. "Minnesotans are looking for a different direction for the country and deserve more than President Obama's policies that have failed to improve the lives of Americans. With the help of my Minnesota finance team, we will be able to raise the funds to defeat President Obama and change the direction of the country."
"We are all honored to help in the fight to get our country on the right track again," said Scott Honour. "After three years of broken promises and failed policies from President Obama, it is clear that we need an accomplished leader like Mitt Romney to fix our economy and bring back jobs. We look forward to raising the necessary resources for Mitt Romney to spread his pro-growth message and bring change to the White House."
