South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy is front and center in a new ad that highlights Marco's record on national security and his ability to unite the party and defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. 
Watch:


I have spent my life fighting to enforce the rule of law and keep Americans safe. And no one is stronger for America's security than Marco Rubio. Destroy ISIS. Protect our borders from all threats.
Marco Rubio will be a commander-in-chief who brings back American strength. I'm Trey Gowdy â€” that's why I support Marco Rubio and that's why the Democrats fear Marco the most.
Rep. Gowdy has been on the trail with Marco a lot in his state lately, and joined him and Sen. Tim Scott on Fox News last night to discuss the campaign in South Carolina.
