    As a result of President Trump's many achievements for Greek American voters, including his economic accomplishments and America First agenda, the United Hellenic Voters of America have endorsed his re-election. While Joe Biden has embraced the socialist agenda of the radical left, including crushing tax hikes and crippling defense cuts, the Trump Administration will always defend the interests of the Greek American community. In a letter to President Trump, the UHVA described his many achievements:
"Your domestic accomplishments, your vision of the future and your demonstrated support of Greece were very ably presented by your National Convention Delegate, Mr. Peter Kopsaftis, and were well received by the UHVA Board of Directors. Greece, as one of the main pillars of Western Civilization, both deserves and needs your administration's support as it faces an existential threat from Turkey. The UHVA urges you to continue your domestic agenda, your vision of the future, and to demonstrate your support for Greece. We stand ready, willing and able to assist your administration in that support. May God Bless You and keep you strong."
