    President Obama and Prime Minister Brown held a meeting this morning on the margins of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. They discussed Britain and the United States' shared interest in Afghanistan and ensuring it could never again be used for attacks by al Qaeda against the United Kingdom, the United States or our allies. They agreed that Iran's nuclear activity was unacceptable, that the international community expected answers on October 1 and was also united in calling upon Iran to live up to its international responsibilities. They also looked forward to a strong agreement from today's G20 Summit which would help secure economic recovery and deliver a global plan for jobs and sustained growth.
