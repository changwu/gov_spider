    I extend my congratulations to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose Progressive Conservative Party won a majority of seats in the House of Commons in yesterday's Canadian national election. In recent years, relations between the United States and Canada have been marked by cooperative dialog and a remarkable record of mutually beneficial achievement. The United States looks forward to working together with Canada to further strengthen the ties of friendship and cooperation between Canada and the United States. In particular, we look forward to the early implementation of the free trade agreement, which we believe will be a positive factor in the economic future of both countries and on the Uruguay round negotiations.
