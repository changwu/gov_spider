    NEW YORK, NY-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement on the ongoing strike by the Writers Guild of America:
"I support the writers in their strike for a fair deal. New Mexico has taken the lead nationally in offering significant incentives to curb the number of productions leaving the country and to keep United States productions here. As a result, we have become a leader in production volume outside of California and New York. So of course we are watching this situation closely.
"While I hope for a quick resolution to this strike in order to avoid any long-term impact on both the production community and the general public, I also recognize that the issue here is complex: how to distribute equitably the revenues generated from emerging distribution sources such as DVDs and the Internet. I am confident that all of the parties involved will see that it is in their mutual interest to come to a fair resolution sooner rather than later. The pot certainly is big enough for everyone.
"Plus, I do not want Stephen Colbert to have any second thoughts about getting out of the race."
