    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.
"Governor McDonnell's leadership in Virginia is an example for the rest of the nation," said Mitt Romney. "Governor McDonnell has used the conservative principles of keeping taxes and spending low and creating a fair regulatory climate to make Virginia a top destination for job creators. These same principles can be used in Washington to fix our economy and make government accountable to the taxpayers. I am proud to have his support and look forward to working with Governor McDonnell."
"As I have said throughout this primary process, we need a governor to serve as our next president," said Governor McDonnell. "America needs leadership and that's what governors do: they lead. Governors actually have to find solutions and bring all parties together in order to get results for their citizens - they can't just sit back and cast votes. Mitt Romney has been an effective leader his entire life, in business, the Olympics and as governor. President Obama's lack of leadership experience is now clear - he has failed to turn around the economy and end the gridlock in Washington. Mitt Romney used his leadership ability in a politically difficult environment to balance the budget every year, cut spending and taxes, and create jobs. He is a results-oriented conservative. This is the type of record that conservatives like me are honored to support - we need a leader like Mitt Romney in the White House to enact effective change that will put our country back on the right path and Americans back to work."
