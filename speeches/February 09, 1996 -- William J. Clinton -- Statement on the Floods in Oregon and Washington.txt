    Our hearts and prayers go out to the thousands of people in Oregon and Washington who have been inundated by the devastating floods and those who are waging a brave fight to keep the water from pouring over the river banks.
In an effort to provide quick action in their urgent time of need, today I have signed Federal disaster declarations for Oregon and Washington. These declarations will give help to individuals, including temporary housing, family grants, and low-interest loans. We are also providing funds to help rebuild the State and local infrastructure.
I have asked FEMA Director James Lee Witt to go to both Oregon and Washington, survey the damage, and lead the Federal response and recovery efforts.
The people of Oregon and Washington have demonstrated a remarkable amount of courage and resilience in this difficult time. I know they cannot recover alone. We are with them for as long as it takes.
Finally, let me take a moment to express my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives during this natural disaster. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
