Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that retired Major General James "Spider" Marks will join Romney for President as a Senior Adviser for National Security Affairs. General Marks will advise Governor Romney on issues pertaining to national security, the United States military and foreign policy.
"General Marks brings more than three decades of valuable experience to our campaign. A highly decorated officer, he is intricately familiar with the needs of our military and intelligence communities as well as the families who support these patriots. I look forward to working with him as we expand our blueprint to strengthen the military and our country's national defense," said Governor Romney. "A stronger America means a stronger military. We need to re-invest in our Armed Forces by adding at least 100,000 more Soldiers and dedicating at least four percent of our GDP to national defense. We must always honor our nation's commitment to the men and women of our military."
Governor Romney has outlined a strong strategy to strengthen our military and intelligence communities. In April 2007, Governor Romney proposed adding at least 100,000 more troops to our Armed Forces and committing at least four percent of our gross domestic product to our national defense. This will help provide the resources needed for equipment, modernization, training, treatment and care of our wounded Soldiers. As President, Governor Romney will also create the Special Partnership Force to unite our civilian, intelligence and military efforts and partner with our allies to defeat jihadists in the unstable areas where they thrive.
Joining Romney for President, General Marks said, "Governor Romney has been outspoken in his commitment to our men and women in the military. Our troops need more support from Washington and Governor Romney will ensure that they have the resources they need to defend this country. I am proud to be joining Governor Romney's campaign.
