    My sympathies and the sympathies of all Americans go out to Aldo Moro's bereaved family and nation.
His murder is a contemptible and cowardly act. His death advances no cause but that of mindless anarchy. But his life was devoted to building his nation, and his political skills were forever at the service of justice.
He stood for civilization and the rule of law, principles which will always outlive the terrorism that seeks to destroy them.
