 FLOTUS voting in Palm Beach Pool Report #1 
?At 10 am, Melania Trump entered the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach to vote. She was the only person not wearing a mask. She waved and smiled to reporters.
She left, flanked by the Palm Beach supervisor of elections, Wendy Sartory Link. She said she was feeling "great." Asked why she did not vote with her husband last week, she said,"It's Election Day, so I wanted to come here to vote today for the election."
She wore a beige sleeveless dress.
