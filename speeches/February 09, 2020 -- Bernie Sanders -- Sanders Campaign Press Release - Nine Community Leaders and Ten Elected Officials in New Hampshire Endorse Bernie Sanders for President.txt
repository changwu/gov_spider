    MANCHESTER â€” Just days ahead of the first in the nation primary, nine community leaders and ten elected officials in New Hampshire announced their endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. These activists, school board members, select members, town councilors, and a state representative join a diverse coalition of Bernie 2020 supporters across the Granite State.
"We are proud to receive this vote of confidence from nearly twenty Granite State leaders today as we work to get out the vote for Bernie Sanders ahead of the first primary. The people of New Hampshire know that Bernie Sanders will always stand up for working people here and across this country," said Will Bateson, Bernie 2020 New Hampshire Political Director.
Sen. Sanders' trustworthiness, his ability to defeat Donald Trump, and his leadership on major issues such as combating climate change and Medicare for All, were among the most cited reasons across all nineteen endorsements.
Rep. Jane Beaulieu, Assistant Majority Leader in the New Hampshire House of Representatives and a former supporter of Sen. Kamala Harris' candidacy, said "Bernie Sanders has built a powerful, positive movement, which can defeat Trump and eliminate the corrupt culture in the White House. I support Bernie's foreign policy on human rights, economic fairness, and his opposition to endless wars."
Mary Ngwanda Georges, a community leader and Founder of Victory Women of Vision, said "Bernie is a strong leader who brings experience, wisdom, and backbone to the table. That is what we need in a Commander-in-Chief. That is what we need if we want to bring people together and move our country forward."
Many other elected officials and community leaders in New Hampshire have also thrown their support behind Sen. Sanders, including New Hampshire's highest ranking Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Andru Volinsky, 22 additional State Representatives, 7 additional local and county elected officials, 101 additional community leaders, and 49 small business owners representing 41 small businesses across all 10 counties.
Bernie 2020 has also welcomed endorsements in the Granite State from organizations including New Hampshire's second largest union SEA/SEIU Local 1984, New Hampshire American Postal Workers Union, New Hampshire Youth Movement, and Rights and Democracy.
