    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Rhode Island Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis.
"As our First Lady for eight years and now as U.S. Senator, Hillary Clinton has had a major influence on our national and international stage," Mollis said. "Senator Clinton has the poise and experience to put America back on the right track and re-establish us as a world leader."
Mollis first met Clinton as mayor of North Providence when he hosted a visit by the then First Lady to North Providence High School in 1998. As President of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns and a member of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Mollis was invited to the White House several times during the Clinton years.
"As a Senator from New York, Clinton knows the challenges that northeastern states face. She understands and is ready to address the needs of Rhode Islanders," Mollis said.
Elected in 2006, Mollis' priorities include making it easier for Rhode Islanders to vote and restoring the public's faith in the fairness of the state's elections. His first months in office have been highlighted by the introduction of his "Voters First" election reform initiative and the first-ever publication of all the state's registered lobbyists and the clients they represent in the new "Rhode Island Government Owner's Manual."
"We've received tremendous support from across Rhode Island, and I'm honored that Secretary of State Mollis has joined our effort," Clinton said.
Secretary of State Mollis joins Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Congressman Jim Langevin and Providence Mayor David Cicilline in supporting Clinton, reflecting her growing support in the Ocean State.
