    Washington, DC -- Hillary Clinton joins millions of Americans in commemorating Cinco de Mayo and the contributions that Mexican Americans have made to our country. This day marks the anniversary of the historic victory of the Mexican people over the French army during the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862.
"This weekend, millions of Americans will celebrate Cinco de Mayo and pay tribute to the rich history and courage of the Mexican people. The story of General Ignacio Zaragoza's triumph in the face of tremendous adversity reminds us of the bravery and sacrifice that continues to inspire millions of people today. I am particularly proud that New York is home to a significant community of hard working families that trace their roots back to the heroic state of Puebla.
"This day of pride and celebration for Mexican Americans has been embraced by Americans of all backgrounds as a tribute to our deep historical, cultural and economic ties to Mexico. It is an opportunity to recognize the many ways in which Mexican Americans enrich the country with their culture. As we celebrate all across the United States today, let us not forget that Cinco de Mayo is a day to appreciate and to celebrate the diversity that makes America a stronger nation."
