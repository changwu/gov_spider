    The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Laura Richardson of Los Angeles. Senator Clinton and Congresswoman Richardson share many issues and initiatives; however Senator Clinton's commitment to equitable access to public education, healthcare, job creation, and economic development earned her the Congresswoman's full endorsement.
"After having worked in corporate America before serving at the local, state, and now Federal level of government, and having participated in California's Presidential legislative briefings, I am fully persuaded that Senator Clinton is the best qualified candidate to be President in 2008," said Congresswoman Richardson. "Whether it is education, creating good paying jobs, sustaining American businesses, or empowering our community, Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring the change California families and urban communities need."
In 2006, then Long Beach City Councilwoman Richardson won a seat in the California State Assembly in the 55th District and served as the Assistant Speaker pro Tempore in the Assembly and was recognized as the first African-American woman, South Bay representative, and freshman to hold this prestigious position. In the state legislature, Richardson was dedicated to expanding access to healthcare, empowering public education, and ensuring safe neighborhoods. More recently, Richardson succeeded 16 candidates in a special election to represent the culturally and economically diverse constituents of California's 37th Congressional District.
"I am honored to receive the support and endorsement of my colleague, Representative Laura Richardson," said Clinton.
Richardson joins with other Southern California elected officials Reps. Jane Harman, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Grace Napolitano, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez in endorsing Hillary Clinton.
