    President Obama today issued a new Executive Order (E.O.) declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the situation in Burundi. The Executive Order is not targeted at the people of Burundi, but rather is aimed at activities by individuals within the government and armed groups that contribute to the turmoil there, including threats to peace and security, actions that undermine democratic institutions, and human rights abuses.
We will continue to support regional efforts to bring about a political resolution to the crisis in Burundi. We call on all parties to renounce violence and to live up to their commitments to participate in an internationally-mediated dialogue outside of Burundi that can lead to the restoration of peace and security and define an inclusive path forward. We will consider how to use this authority further to impose additional sanctions against those who are involved in actions or policies that exacerbate the situation in Burundi.
Specifically, the E.O. targets those determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, any of the following in or in relation to Burundi:
•      actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi;
•      actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Burundi;
•      human rights abuses;
•      the targeting of women, children, or any civilians through the commission of acts of violence (including killing, maiming, torture, or rape or other sexual violence), abduction, forced displacement, or attacks on schools, hospitals, religious sites, or locations where civilians are seeking refuge, or through other conduct that may constitute a serious abuse or violation of human rights or a violation of international humanitarian law;
•      actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly;
•      the use or recruitment of children by armed groups or armed forces;
•      the obstruction of the delivery or distribution of, or access to, humanitarian assistance; or
•      attacks, attempted attacks, or threats against United Nations missions, international security presences, or other peacekeeping operations.
The E.O. also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to target any person determined to be a leader or official of:
•      an entity, including any government entity or armed group, that has, or whose members have, engaged in any of the activities described above; or
•      an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.
The E.O. also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to target any person determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of:
•      any of the activities described above; or
•      any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.
Finally, the E.O. authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to target any person owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.
Individuals identified or designated for the imposition of sanctions under the E.O., including the four individuals that have been listed today in the Annex of the E.O., will have their property and interests in property in the United States blocked or frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from doing business with them. The E.O. also imposes visa restrictions on individuals identified or designated under the E.O.
The President imposed sanctions on the following four individuals listed in the Annex to the E.O.:
1. Alain Guillaume Bunyoni: [Minister of Public Security]
Alain Guillaume Bunyoni is the Minister of Public Security in Burundi and has overseen the Government's internal security efforts, including those of Burundi's National Police (PNB), an entity whose members have engaged in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi. Under Bunyoni, the PNB has conducted operations in cooperation with the Imbonerakure youth militia to intimidate and silence those who oppose or who are perceived to oppose the Government of Burundi.
2. Godefroid Bizimana: [Deputy Director-General of the National Police]
Godefroid Bizimana is a leader of the PNB, an entity whose members have engaged in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of Burundi, human rights abuses, and actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly. Bizimana directed the PNB's operations to disrupt peaceful protests of those opposed to the Government of Burundi, including a disproportionate use of force and acts of violent repression. In response to protests, PNB officers used tear gas, water cannons, and blocked the free movement of demonstrators. Protestors were arrested and twenty of them were reportedly transported to a location where they were beaten by police officers.
3. Godefroid Niyombare: [Major General, Former Chief of Burundi Intelligence Service (SNR)]
Godefroid Niyombare is responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi, and is a leader or official of an entity that has engaged in such activities. As the leader of an attempt to overthrow the Government of Burundi in May 2015, Niyombare's actions contributed to the deterioration of stability within Burundi. After announcing the coup, Niyombare ordered the closure of Burundi's land borders and its primary airport in an attempt to stop Nkurunziza from returning from Tanzania.
4. Cyrille Ndayirukiye: [Former Minister of Defense] 
Cyrille Ndayirukiye is responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi, and is a leader or official of an entity that has engaged in such activities. As deputy leader of an attempt to overthrow the Government of Burundi in May 2015, Ndayirukiye's actions contributed to the deterioration of stability within Burundi. Ndayiruke was detained in June by the Government of Burundi, which should grant full and regular humanitarian access by independent monitors to confirm Ndayiruke and other detainees are not being subjected to torture or ill-treatment.
