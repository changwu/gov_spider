    Without a plan of his own, Obama launches misleading attacks
As the price of oil passed $120 a barrel today, the Clinton Campaign launched a new ad in Indiana and North Carolina outlining Hillary's plan to suspend the gas tax for American drivers this summer, paid for by a windfall profits tax on big oil companies and their record earnings.
The 30-second spot, entitled "What's Happened" notes that Sen. Obama has launched misleading attacks about Hillary's plan because he has no solution of his own to lower gas prices for American consumers. By forcing oil companies to pay the gas tax, Hillary's plan would save motorists about $8 billion.

Following is the script for the ad.
