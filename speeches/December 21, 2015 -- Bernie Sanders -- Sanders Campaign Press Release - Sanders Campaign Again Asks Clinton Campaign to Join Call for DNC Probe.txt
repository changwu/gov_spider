    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Bernie Sanders' campaign on Monday renewed its call for Hillary Clinton's campaign to join in requesting an investigation of firewall failures in voter databases maintained by the Democratic National Committee.
"As the Clinton campaign knows, this is not the first firewall failure at the DNC. There was at least one other failure two months ago that we discovered and reported. Failures like these open the possibility for data access by any campaign," Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said.
"We hope the Clinton campaign will join us in calling for a thorough, independent investigation starting from Day One in the campaign to review all possible data security failures that may have occurred at the DNC," the spokesman added.
