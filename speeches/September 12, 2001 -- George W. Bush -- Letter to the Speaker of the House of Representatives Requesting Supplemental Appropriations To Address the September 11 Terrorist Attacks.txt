    Sir:
Yesterday, evil and despicable acts of terror were perpetrated against our fellow citizens. Our way of life, indeed our very freedom, came under attack. Our first priority is to respond swiftly and surely. We need to do so in a way that will make Americans proud, especially those heroes who are struggling so valiantly to deal with yesterday's tragedy.
Immediate steps are being taken to protect our citizens at home and around the world. I implemented our Government's emergency response plans, and the functions of our Government continue without interruption. I have directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice.
Now Congress must act. I ask the Congress to immediately pass and send to me the enclosed request for $20,000,000,000 in FY 2001 emergency appropriations to provide resources to address the terrorist attacks on the United States that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the consequences of such attacks. Passing this supplemental appropriations bill without delay will send a powerful signal of unity to our fellow Americans and to the world. If additional resources are necessary, I will forward another request for additional funding.
I designate the entire amount as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
