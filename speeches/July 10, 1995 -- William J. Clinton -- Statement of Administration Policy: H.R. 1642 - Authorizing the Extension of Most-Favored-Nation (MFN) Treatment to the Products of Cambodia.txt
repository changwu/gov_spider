    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Crane (R) Illinois and Rangel (D) New York)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 1642.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring 
H.R. 1642 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that this bill would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this proposal may deviate from this estimate.
