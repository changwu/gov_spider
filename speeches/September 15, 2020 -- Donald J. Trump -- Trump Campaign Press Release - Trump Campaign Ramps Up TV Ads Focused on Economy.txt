    President Trump's re-election campaign today announced it has increased its television advertising buy by nearly 50 percent, ramping up its presence in key states with early voting and expanding its national cable buy. The ads in the eight-figure buy focus on the economy, which will be the defining issue of the race, and contrasts President Trump's strong economic record with Joe Biden's 47 years of failure. The ads airing on local television beginning Tuesday feature real people whose lives have been positively impacted by President Trump's policies, with different people featured in different states.
President Trump built the world's best economy once and is already doing it a second time. As vice president, Joe Biden oversaw the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression and today proposes to raise taxes by $4 trillion, killing the economic comeback underway. Biden voted for the job-killing NAFTA trade deal and has a history of arguing for China's interests, costing the United States 60,000 factories and 3.5 million jobs.
The ads will run on national cable, and local broadcast and cable in the following states: North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nebraska (2nd Congressional District), and Maine (2nd Congressional District). The Trump campaign also announced it was expanding its existing urban radio buy to include Pennsylvania markets.
"This week's advertising continues our strategic plan to follow the dates on the calendar, the states that are voting early, the data that always guides our decision-making and our pathway to 270," said Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien.
