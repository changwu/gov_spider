    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Tomorrow, Senator John Edwards will run a full-page ad in Roll Call, the newspaper read by all of Congress, calling on members of Congress to use their power to stop President Bush from escalating the war in Iraq. (Click here to view a PDF copy of the ad.)
The ad will include the names of thousands of Americans who have signed Edwards' petition demanding that Congress block funds for an escalation of troops in Iraq. Over 80,000 Americans from across the country have joined Edwards in speaking out and urging Congress to use its power of the purse to stop the President from escalating the war, as it has in the past, including in Vietnam, Lebanon, Nicaragua and Colombia.
The text of the ad will read:
"LAST NIGHT, YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SPEAK.
TODAY, LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
The names printed here represent a sample of more than 80,000 people who have joined John Edwards in calling on Congress to block funding of Bush's escalation of the war in Iraq.
