    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Lord Conrad M. Black of Crossharbour.
In 2007, prosecutors alleged that Lord Black had committed several acts of mail fraud and obstruction. The Supreme Court of the United States, however, largely disagreed and overturned almost all charges in his case. He nevertheless spent 3.5 years in prison.
An entrepreneur and scholar, Lord Black has made tremendous contributions to business, as well as to political and historical thought. Formerly the owner of the world's then-third largest newspaper, he is also the author of several notable biographies and works of history. These include comprehensive biographies of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon, a complete history of Canada, and an impressive essay evaluating how the world would have been different had Japan not attacked Pearl Harbor.
Lord Black's case has attracted broad support from many high-profile individuals who have vigorously vouched for his exceptional character. This impressive list includes former Secretary of State Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Sir Elton John, Rush Limbaugh, the late William F. Buckley, Jr., and many additional notable individuals. Consistent with his distinguished reputation for helping others, while in prison, Lord Black served as a tutor for 150 students, helping them achieve their educational goals. In light of these facts, Mr. Black is entirely deserving of this Grant of Executive Clemency.
