    The President today nominated Judge Daniel Hurley to serve as a U.S. District Court judge for the Southern District of Florida.
"Daniel Hurley has distinguished himself in close to 20 years on the bench as a judge of outstanding capability," said the President. "I expect him to meet that same high standard as a Federal District Court judge."
