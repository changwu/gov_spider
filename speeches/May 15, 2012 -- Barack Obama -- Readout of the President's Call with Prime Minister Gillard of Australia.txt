    The President spoke on the phone with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard late last evening, to continue their regular consultations on Afghanistan ahead of the May 21 ISAF Summit in Chicago. The President updated Prime Minister Gillard on recent key developments in the U.S. relationship with Afghanistan, including his recent trip to Afghanistan and the signing of the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement. During their discussion, the President and Prime Minister confirmed their shared goals for the ISAF meeting, to include moving forward with our effort to transition to Afghan lead responsibility, and agreeing on sufficient and sustainable Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) that can continue the progress the international community has already made. The President noted that Australia is one of our closest partners in Afghanistan, and expressed appreciation for Australia's significant contributions and Prime Minister Gillard's leadership.
