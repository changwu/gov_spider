    Former Florida House Speaker and small businessman Allan Bense today made the following statement on President Obama's claim that his economic policies have "worked":
"In this election, the American people are looking for a plan to get us out of the economic downturn. President Obama says of his economic policy, 'It worked.' He's made clear that if he wins reelection, he will pursue the same failed policies as he has in his first term. We can't afford four more years of high unemployment, sluggish growth, and skyrocketing debt. That President Obama thinks his policies have worked is the best evidence yet that we need a new president."
