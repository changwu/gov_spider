    "John Kasich is the only candidate in this race who can beat Donald Trump. If Republicans want to nominate a candidate who can win the White House, the only choice is John Kasich."
— Trent Duffy, national spokesman Kasich for America
The Washington Post is out with a must-read delegate analysis concluding that a John Kasich victory in Ohio is likely the only way to stop Donald Trump from becoming the nominee.
From The Washington Post:
"Then there is the matter of Ohio. Ohio is winner-take-all, as I mentioned above, but is made more complicated for Trump because Kasich, the Republican governor of the state, is still in the race. A Quinnipiac University poll out Tuesdaymorning shows Trump at 31 percent in the state with Kasich close behind at 26 percent. It's not clear whether Kasich can beat Trump in the Buckeye State or if he will be able to stay in the race all the way until March 15 when Ohio voters go to the polls. But, if Kasich could beat Trump in Ohio, you subtract 66 delegates from Trump's 1,246 — leaving him at 1,180, and just short of the nomination."
