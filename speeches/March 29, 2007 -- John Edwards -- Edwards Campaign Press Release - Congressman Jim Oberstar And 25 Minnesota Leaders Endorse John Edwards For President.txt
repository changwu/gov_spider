He has called for a national goal of eliminating poverty within 30 years, with policies rooted in the core American values of opportunity for everyone and responsibility from everyone. And he has a plan to restore America's moral leadership by cleaning up the mess in Iraq. A John Edwards presidency will transform America for the better."
