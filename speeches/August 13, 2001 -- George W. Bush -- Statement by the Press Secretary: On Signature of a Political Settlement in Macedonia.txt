    The United States welcomes today's signature of a political settlement in Macedonia. We commend the leadership of President Boris Trajkovski in negotiating the agreement with Macedonia's main political parties. We also wish to express appreciation to the European Union's Francois Leotard and U.S. Ambassador Jim Pardew for their important role in facilitating the settlement.
Today's settlement promises to strengthen Macedonia's democracy and help meet the political aspirations of all its citizens. To fulfill this promise, the cease-fire must be respected, the insurgents must disarm and disband, and Macedonia's Assembly must adopt the necessary constitutional amendments and legislation.
The United States has consistently supported the territorial integrity and political unity of Macedonia. We have worked closely with the European Union and NATO to prevent further conflict and to convince the extremists to lay down their arms. These goals will continue to drive U.S. policy towards Macedonia in the weeks and months ahead. Today's agreement gives hope that peace can return to Macedonia and that Macedonia can return to its path toward Europe.
