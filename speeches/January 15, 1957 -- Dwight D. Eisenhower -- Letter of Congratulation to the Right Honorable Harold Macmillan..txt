Dear Harold,
I send my warmest congratulations to you on becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Your distinguished career is well known on this side of the Atlantic, and has earned our widespread respect. My own warm admiration stems, as you know, from our association in North Africa and through the succeeding years. For me that association has been as agreeable as it has been productive.
I feel confident you will bring to your new task the same vision, determination and sympathetic understanding you have shown in the past. For myself, and for the people of the United States, let me wish you every success in carrying out the great responsibilities which now devolve upon you as Prime Minister.
With warm regard.
DWIGHT D. Eisenhower
