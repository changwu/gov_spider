    Today in Greenville, South Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a listening session with local voting rights advocates. They included Sulaiman Ahmad, who works for the South Carolina Justice project; Elias Valentin II, who led a voter protection effort during the 2020 election; and Reverend Telley Lynette Gadson, who is the Senior Pastor of Saint Mark United Methodist.
The group discussed what is happening on the ground in South Carolinaâ€”namely what they are doing to get people registered to vote, strengthen election infrastructure, and expand voting rights through bills that are moving through the legislature. The Vice President thanked participants for their tireless work and expressed the Administration's support.
Since the Vice President took on her leadership role for the Administration's voting rights efforts, she has spoken with a number of local and national leaders. This is the first meeting the Vice President has done on the ground regarding voting rights. On Wednesday, in Washington, D.C., she will meet with members of the Texas state legislature who blocked a bill that would limit the right to vote.
