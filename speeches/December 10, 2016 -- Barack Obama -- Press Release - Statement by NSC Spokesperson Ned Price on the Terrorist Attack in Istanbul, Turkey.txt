    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack today in Istanbul, Turkey, which killed and wounded dozens.  The attack appears to have targeted police forces.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and loved ones, and to all the people of Turkey.  We stand together with Turkey, our NATO Ally, against all terrorists who threaten Turkey, the United States, and global peace and stability.
