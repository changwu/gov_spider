    In a successful raid against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) headquarters, brave U.S. forces were instrumental in killing an estimated 14 AQAP members and capturing important intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.
Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic servicemember has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. The sacrifices made by the men and women of our Armed Forces, and the families they leave behind, are the backbone of the liberty we hold so dear as Americans, united in our pursuit of a safer nation and a freer world. My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen servicemember. I also pray for a quick and complete recovery for the brave servicemembers who sustained injuries.
