    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 204(f) of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, I hereby transmit the Annual Report for 1984 of the Federal Council on the Aging. The report reflects the Council's views in its role of examining programs serving older Americans.
It should be noted that the 1985 Annual Report of the Medicare Board of Trustees indicates that projected annual revenues from payroll taxes are expected to be sufficient to pay annual enrollee benefits for Medicare Part A through the first part of the next decade, and reserves in the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund are likely to be sufficient to cover annual shortfalls for an additional five years. Data from the 1985 Trustees Report should be used to update statements made on page 21 of the Annual Report of the Federal Council on the Aging.
RONALD REAGAN
