    First Lady Melania Trump was at the United States Capitol this morning for a discussion surrounding the anniversary signing of the Support Act. Administration officials and members of Congress joined the First Lady for a panel discussion in the Mansfield Room. The First Lady delivered opening remarks thanking the members for the important work they are doing to implement the SUPPORT Act. Mrs. Trump highlighted several policies of the law that closely align with her BE BEST initiative including how the legislation provides support to drug-dependent mothers and babies who have neonatal abstinence syndrome. Through this legislation, agencies can look for ways to reduce opioid use during pregnancy and how to recognize early childhood issues related to substance abuse.
Following her remarks, members of Congress shared how the Act continues to affect their local communities in the fight to reduce drug abuse. The discussion addressed the overall addiction and mental health issues involved in this drug crisis. The conversation also touched on the successful ways that law enforcement has stopped the influx of drugs. Several members praised the supportive bipartisan nature in passing legislation to help end the crisis.
"Today on the Hill was a great opportunity to acknowledge the incredible work the Administration is doing in our communities and throughout this nation to end the drug crisis through the SUPPORT Act," said First Lady Melania Trump. "It also served as a continued call to action for members of Congress to continue building on what is working and identifying ways that all levels of government can support the effort. I look forward to working together with Congress to continue providing support to families suffering from this terrible crisis."
