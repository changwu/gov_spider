Great writer and historian Doug Wead has written a true (not Fake News) account of what is going on in Washington and the White House.

When Lisa Page the lover of Peter Strzok talks about being 'crushed' and how innocent she is ask her to read Peter's 'Insurance Policy' text to her just in case Hillary loses.

Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat but to go after President Trump only.
