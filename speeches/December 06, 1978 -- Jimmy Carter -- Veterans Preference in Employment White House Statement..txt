    On Monday, the Department of Justice lodged an amicus curiae brief with the United States Supreme Court in the case of Massachusetts v. Feeney. In that case the Supreme Court will be reviewing a Federal District Court ruling that the Massachusetts veterans preference law is unconstitutional.
The Attorney General has advised the President that the Justice Department brief in no way conflicts with the President's policy on veterans preference in Federal employment. The President believes that our Nation is deeply indebted to those who have served in our Armed Forces, and that government can and should provide appropriate preferences and benefits to veterans in recognition of this debt. However, as the President has said repeatedly over the past year, be also believes that the existing Federal veterans preference law for nondisabled veterans unduly interferes with employment opportunities for women and minorities and with efficient and businesslike management. That is why the President has proposed significant reforms in the law. His position on reforming the existing Federal veterans preference for nondisabled veterans remains unchanged.
