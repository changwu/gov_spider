    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: World AIDS Day, 1994
As you know, December 1, 1994, is World AIDS Dayâ€”a day set aside for our Nation and for the world to reflect on the scope of the HIV pandemic, to honor those we have lost, and to renew our commitment to fight this disease on all fronts.
It is my hope that all departments and agencies once again will plan significant activities to recognize World AIDS Day, as so many did last year. I was touched by the outstanding programs many of your agencies presented for employees, and I appreciated the acts of personal service a number of you performed for people living with HIV and AIDS. These activities exemplify what we have worked to make hallmarks of this Administration: leadership by example and putting people first.
The theme of World AIDS Day, 1994, "AIDS and Families: Protect and Care for the Ones We Love," recognizes that HIV is a challenge to families, not just individuals. Family members must work together to protect their loved ones from becoming infected. And all family members share responsibility for those who have become ill.
In order to begin planning for December 1, I request that each agency head designate an appropriate individual to plan and coordinate World AIDS Day, 1994, activities for the agency. Please inform the White House Office of the National AIDS policy coordinator by November 1 of the individual you have selected who will act as the coordinator for your agency's activities, and keep the office informed of the activities you plan for that day. The Office also will sponsor a meeting of coordinators from all the agencies and will inform your World AIDS Day coordinator of the time and place.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
