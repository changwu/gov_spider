    Donald J. Trump, in his personal capacity as candidate for re-election as President of the United States, today moved to intervene in the Texas v. Pennsylvania, et. al. action at the United States Supreme Court. The President intervened because his rights as a candidate are affected by the Defendant States' failure to follow and enforce state election laws during the 2020 election.
The Trump campaign issued the following statements:
"I'm honored that the President asked me to represent him in this matter. I think his intervention in this case strengthens an already very strong original action by the state of Texas."
- John C. Eastman, Counsel of Record for President Trump.
"President Trump is fully committed to ensuring election integrity and fulfilling his oath to defend and protect the United States Constitution against state officials' misconduct and violations of law that irredeemably compromised this election. We look forward to the Supreme Court resolving these important issues of election integrity that ultimately affect all Americans, and providing a remedy to the corruption that occurred."
- Jenna Ellis, Senior Legal Adviser to the Trump 2020 Campaign and Attorney to President Trump.
