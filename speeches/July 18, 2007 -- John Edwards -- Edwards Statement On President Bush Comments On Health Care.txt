    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about President Bush's comments on our health care system at a roundtable today.
"The obstacle to expanding health care in America is none other than George Bush. On his watch, the number of uninsured Americans has grown by 5 million, while he remains ideologically committed to the profits of private insurers. His threat to veto legislation to cover 3 million more children is heartless and shortsighted.
"I am proud to be the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific plan for truly universal health care. As president, I will take on the insurance and drug companies to cover every man, woman and child and will work until we pass a plan.
