    Today I am announcing that I will use the Economic Policy Council and the Domestic Policy Council to advise me in the formulation, coordination, and implementation of economic and domestic policy. Along with the National Security Council, the Economic Policy Council and the Domestic Policy Council will serve as the primary channels for advising the President on policy.
The close interrelationship between the U.S. and international economies illustrates the need to review economic policy issues in a comprehensive manner that best serves the national interest of the United States. The Economic Policy Council will serve as the primary channel for advising me on the formulation, coordination, and implementation of economic policy, both domestic and international.
The important social issues facing our nation require thoughtful and creative solutions. The Domestic Policy Council will serve as the primary channel for advising me on the formulation, coordination, and implementation of domestic and social policy.
My commitment to this Cabinet Council structure reflects my conviction that effective decisionmaking depends on the President receiving the best information available from his senior advisers. I believe that these policy councils will effectively coordinate advice from the various departments and agencies.
