    Today California Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes announced his support for Gov. John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America California leadership team.
Said Mayes, "John Kasich's proven record of supporting job creation, balancing budgets and bringing people together around solutions that lift everyone is exactly what Californians deserve from their leaders. Governor Kasich's smart, commonsense brand of conservatism is a good fit for those of us fighting on behalf of middle class families struggling in California and proves he's the only Republican who can defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I'm looking forward to working with the team to get the word out to voters."

Since 2014, Mayes has represented California's 42nd Assembly District, which encompasses portions of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. After only 10 months in office, his colleagues elected him Republican Leader, a role in which he negotiates with Governor Jerry Brown and legislative Democrats on behalf of his caucus. Assemblyman Mayes is a passionate advocate for conservative policies that lift people out of poverty. As a member of the respected Little Hoover Commission, Mayes is working to develop reforms that make government more efficient and effective.
Said Kasich, "It's an honor to receive the support of Republican Leader Chad Mayes, a real change agent in the California Assembly. As Republican Leader he has fought tirelessly for policies that spend taxpayer money wisely while helping people who are hurting to get back on their feet. I'm thrilled to welcome him to our team and look forward to his contributions."
