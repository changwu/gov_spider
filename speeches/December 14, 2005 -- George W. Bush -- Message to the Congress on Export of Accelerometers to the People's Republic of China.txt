    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export of 36 accelerometers to the People's Republic of China's Ministry of Railways, for use in a railroad track geometry measuring system, is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such export, will not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.
