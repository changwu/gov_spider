    Today, at President Donald J. Trump's direction, the White House and the Department of Defense announced that 100 megahertz of contiguous, coast-to-coast mid-band spectrum will be made available for commercial 5G deployment.
With high speeds, improved reliability, and low latency, 5G will improve every industry and the lives of all Americans. It can travel long distances to ensure that all Americans have access to the networks, while delivering ultra-fast speeds and high performance that will power the technologies of the future.
President Trump is committed to strengthening United States leadership in 5G communications for the security and prosperity of the American people. With 5G networks already available to more than 250 million Americans, we have made significant strides. The availability of more mid-band spectrum is a key factor to driving widespread 5G access across rural America.
Throughout this process, the Trump Administration has worked carefully to ensure that commercial use of this critically needed mid-band spectrum will never compromise military preparedness or national security.
5G will be as much as 100 times faster than current 4G networks. It will transform the way our citizens work, learn, communicate, and travel. It will make American farms more productive, American manufacturing more competitive, and American healthcare better and more accessible. 5G networks will create astonishing and thrilling new opportunities for all Americans.
