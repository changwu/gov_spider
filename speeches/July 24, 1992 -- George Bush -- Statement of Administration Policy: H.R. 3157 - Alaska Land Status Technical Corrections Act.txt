    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/27/92)(House)(Young (R) AK and Miller (D) CA)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R; 3157. However, while the bill would address many problems associated with land titles and claims in Alaska, several issues remain unresolved. The Administration, therefore, will seek, during further congressional consideration, additional clarifying amendments to remedy these concerns.
