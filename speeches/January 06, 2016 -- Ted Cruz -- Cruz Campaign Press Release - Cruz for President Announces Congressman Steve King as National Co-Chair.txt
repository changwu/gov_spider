    HOUSTON, Texas â€” The Cruz for President campaign announced Congressman Steve King to serve as a National Co-Chair for Cruz. King endorsed Cruz in November of last year saying that Cruz is the "one man that stands out as the courageous conservative whom I believe can restore the soul of America." King is a seven term Congressman who has been a consistent leader fighting for conservative issues like securing our border, protecting life and marriage and our Constitution. King has joined Cruz on the road in Iowa this week during the "Cruzin' for Caucus" Iowa bus tour, hitting 28 counties in six days.
"Ted Cruz has been a consistent and tireless fighter on the issues that matter most to conservatives, such as Obamacare, religious liberty, life, and stopping Obama's lawless executive actions," said King. "He is the full spectrum constitutional conservative in the race. We need someone who does what they say they're going to do in the White House in order to get this country back on track. This election is a critical one for conservatives. We need to come together to elect a strong, principled leader to win the White House in 2016. "
"Steve is an incredible leader and fighter for conservative principles. I am very pleased to have him take on this role as National Co-Chair," said Cruz. "Steve's experience taking on the Washington Cartel, fighting for the American people and protecting our liberties is an asset to this team. We need courageous conservatives all across the country to rise up and work together to get this country back to its founding principles."
