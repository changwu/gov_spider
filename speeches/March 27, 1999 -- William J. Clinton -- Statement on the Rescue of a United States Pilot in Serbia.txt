    I am pleased with the news that our pilot has been rescued successfully. I am tremendously proud of the skill and bravery of the pilot and of the courageous individuals who participated in the recovery.
As I have said from the outset, this military operation entails real risk. However, the continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces further underscores the necessity for NATO forces to persevere.
Our NATO operations will go forward as planned. I strongly support the decision of Secretary General Solana to move to a new phase of the air campaign, which will include a wider range of targets, including forces in the field.
