    MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€” Following a weekend of events across the state of Nevada, Senator Amy Klobuchar today announced that her campaign had raised over $12 million since her strong debate performance in New Hampshire, and that this week the campaign will have 25 staffers in South Carolina and staff on the ground in every Super Tuesday state.
"Amy continues to outperform expectations and is surging across the country," said Campaign Manager Justin Buoen. "Following her debate performance, we raised $12 million and now will have staff on the ground in every Super Tuesday state, which will allow us to compete everywhere."
Klobuchar continues to barnstorm the Silver State leading up to the First In The West caucuses on Saturday.
