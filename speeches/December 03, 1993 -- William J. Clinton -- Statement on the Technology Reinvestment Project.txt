    To win in the new global economy and safeguard our national security, America must invest in new technologies with both commercial and military applications. This program will help give us the edge that will keep America strong and create new jobs at the same time.
This program is designed to keep American manufacturing workers, from the engineers to the machine operators, at the top of their fields. Efficient, high-quality production using a skilled, well-equipped work force will put American products on shelves throughout the world and put Americans to work in high-paying jobs here at home.
