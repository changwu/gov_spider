    Dear Mr. Speaker:
On August 27th, I announced that I would submit a supplemental request to the Congress of approximately $2 billion to pay for comprehensive response and recovery efforts after Hurricane Charley. This was in addition to response and recovery efforts being undertaken by federal government agencies using existing resources and programs.
Because of the severity and timing of Hurricane Frances, I ask the Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed request, totaling $2.0 billion, for an emergency FY 2004 supplemental appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security.
I hereby designate this proposal in the amount requested herein as an emergency requirement. This request responds to urgent needs associated with Hurricanes Charley and Frances in Florida and other affected areas, and will enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to additional disasters should they occur.
The enclosed request requires immediate action by the Congress to ensure that the immediate response efforts to these recent disasters continue uninterrupted. I anticipate making a further request in the coming days that will provide for a comprehensive response and recovery effort addressing the impact of both of these hurricanes. In addition, federal government agencies will continue their response and recovery efforts using existing resources and programs.
The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
