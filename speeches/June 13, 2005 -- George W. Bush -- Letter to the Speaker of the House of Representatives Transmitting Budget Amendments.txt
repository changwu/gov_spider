    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget amendments for the Department of Justice and the General Services Administration. In addition, this transmittal contains FY 2006 budget amendments for the Legislative and Judicial Branches. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of the Legislative and Judicial Branches are commonly transmitted without change.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
