    Faced with many legitimate questions about Senator Obama's long-time relationship with indicted political fixer Tony Rezko, the Obama campaign has chosen to lash out at Senator Clinton.
Here are the facts:
Over 20 years of the Clintons' tax returns are in the public domain.
Their tax returns since they left the White House will be made available on or around April 15.
This information will be in addition to 15 years of uninterrupted public financial disclosure reports.
Instead of making false attacks, we urge Senator Obama to release all relevant financial and other information related to indicted political fixer Tony Rezko.
