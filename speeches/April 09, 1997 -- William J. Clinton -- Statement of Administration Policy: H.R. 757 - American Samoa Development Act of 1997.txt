    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Faleomavaega (D) AS)
The Administration supports the objectives of H.R. 757 to analyze and plan for the economic future of American Samoa. However, the Administration does not support H.R. 757, which would establish a commission for these purposes. As set forth in Executive Order No. 12838, Administration support for new commissions is to be limited only to those cases "compelled by considerations of national security, health or safety, or similar national interests." The establishment of a commission by H.R. 757 is also unnecessary because the Administration will use existing authority to accomplish the bill's objectives.
