    I was saddened to learn of the passing this morning of Dr. Albert Sabin, one of the great heroes of American medicine. The oral polio vaccine that he developed has saved countless lives and provided millions more with the comfort of security.
I have made a commitment to work towards the goal of ensuring that all of our Nation's children receive proper immunizations. This loss today reminds us all of the seriousness with which that task must be taken. We must continue the battle which Albert Sabin so nobly waged.
