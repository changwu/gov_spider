    Will Campaign in California This Weekend
LOS ANGELES - Activist, actor and producer Josh Hutcherson today endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for President. Hutcherson will hit the campaign trail for Bernie 2020 this weekend, travelling to California as part of a Students for Bernie College Tour with stops at Santa Monica City College and UC Santa Barbara.
"When I was on the campaign trail in 2016 time after time I saw Bernie inspire hope in everyone he met," said Hutcherson. "He's the leading candidate on climate change and getting money out of D.C.. Not only will he be the candidate to beat Donald Trump but he will be the leader we need to meet the challenges we face as a nation and as a global society. It scares me to think about what the future may be like if we don't start making big changes and Bernie is the person I want to build the platform upon which we can all rise."
