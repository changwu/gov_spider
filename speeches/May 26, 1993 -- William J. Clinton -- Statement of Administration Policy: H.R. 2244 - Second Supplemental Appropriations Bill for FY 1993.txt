    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Natcher (D), Kentucky)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 2244.
In an effort to provide a down payment on the Administration's long-term investment program, the President asked Congress to consider a new package of key, targeted investments. H.R. 2244 contains these key investments.
The Administration supports the Committee's efforts to offset the spending contained in this legislation. While the Administration has concerns with a few of the items selected for rescission, we will work to resolve these concerns later in the process.
The mandate of the American people in November was to promote change and move this Nation forward. This legislation will help fulfill that mandate.
