    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Glickman (D) KS)
The Administration supports H.R. 2330. The Administration, however, will seek during further congressional action to have certain provisions modified. These provisions would abolish the National Security Education Trust Fund and modify the Foreign Language Proficiency Pay.
The Administration will seek to manage prudently reductions of the intelligence authorization contained in H.R. 2330; the Administration will oppose any amendment on the House floor further reducing intelligence spending.
The Administration opposes any change to H.R. 2330 that would disclose, or require the disclosure of, the aggregate amount of funds authorized for intelligence activities. The current procedure that provides for the authorization of appropriations in a classifies annex continues to be appropriate.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2330 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The bill does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, its deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 2330 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the Congressional session, as required by OBRA.
