    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Florida Congressman Jeff Miller.
"I am proud to have Congressman Miller's support," said Mitt Romney. "He is a committed public servant both to the state of Florida and our country's veterans and I will work with leaders like him to revitalize the state."
"After three years, it is clear to Florida voters that President Obama's liberal policies are not working," said Congressman Jeff Miller. "The differences between President Obama and Mitt Romney are stark. At home, President Obama had no experience in the real world and has failed to improve the economy; Mitt Romney is a conservative businessman who has a lifetime of experience turning around troubled enterprises. Abroad, President Obama has weakened relations with allies; Mitt Romney has laid out a foreign policy that strengthens America's relationships with our allies while providing for our military men and women overseas and at home. I am proud to support Mitt, and look forward to working with him to help create jobs in Florida and provide the care that our servicemen and veterans deserve."
