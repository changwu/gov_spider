CNBC: Strong Job Growth Is Back: Payrolls Jump in June Well Above Expectations
"Payroll growth rebounded sharply in June as the U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs, the best gain since January and running contrary to worries that both the employment picture and overall growth picture were beginning to weaken. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.7% as labor force participation rose, according to the Labor Department. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected nonfarm payrolls to rise by 165,000 and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.6%."
MARKETWATCH: Labor Market Comes Roaring Back as Jobs See 'Nice Pop,' Economists Say
"Economists said Friday's June jobs report showed a labor market that was 'roaring back,' with the U.S. creating 224,000 jobs, easily beating the 170,000 forecast. 'The U.S. labor market came roaring back in June, with 224K jobs being created, well above the consensus forecast. That was in line with our expectations and the encouraging readings on jobless claims, and was only slightly offset by -11K in revisions to the prior two months together. The unemployment rate ticked up but that was a reflection of the increase in the participation rate, which still has room to rise further ahead.' â€” Katherine Judge, CIBC Economics."
