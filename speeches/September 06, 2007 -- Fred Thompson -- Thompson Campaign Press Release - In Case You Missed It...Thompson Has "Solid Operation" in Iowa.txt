Politico's Jonathan Martin Clearly Impressed With Fred Thompson's Iowa Operation . "Bob Haus is a veteran GOP consultant in Iowa. Most recently, he directed the Ames Straw Poll. Along with Midwest regional political director Andrew Dorr, Thompson now has two solid home-grown Hawkeye hands helming his caucus effort. Add in two young operatives fresh off Iowa campaigns last cycle and Fred has got a solid operation there, especially given how late he's getting in."

Robert J. Haus, another longtime conservative activist in Iowa, is the Executive Director of Thompson's campaign in Iowa. Haus brings extensive political and grassroots experience to the campaign: Haus was campaign manager for Charles Grassley's Senate campaign in 1992, was Iowa Director for Phil Gramm's presidential campaign, and served as a senior consultant for Steve Forbes' Presidential campaign in 2000. Additionally, Haus is the founder of Eagle Media Group, a firm that served Progress for America and dozens of other conservative groups, including the Republican Party of Iowa from 2004-2007. Haus is a graduate of Iowa State University and the University of Iowa College of Law. Haus will oversee Thompson's Iowa operation and will assist the campaign with Iowa media strategy.
