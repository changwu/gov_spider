    Mitt Romney today announced endorsements in Wisconsin.
"In 2008, Barack Obama came to Wisconsin and promised to change Washington," said Mitt Romney. "Four years later, it is clear that he has not met his promises and has failed Wisconsin and the American people. I am running to restore America's promise, bring jobs back to Wisconsin, and fix our fiscal mess. With the hard work of these leaders in Wisconsin, we can bring conservative change to Washington and ensure that our future remains bright."
Announcing Mitt Romney's Wisconsin endorsements, State Senator Alberta Darling said, "It is time for Republicans to unite in our efforts to defeat President Obama and nominate the only leader who can win in November and bring real change to Washington. Mitt Romney has proved throughout this long primary process that he is head-and-shoulders above the rest of the candidates when it comes to understanding the economy and presenting an economic plan that will create jobs. Wisconsin deserves a leader like Mitt Romney and he deserves the support of Wisconsin voters in April and November."
