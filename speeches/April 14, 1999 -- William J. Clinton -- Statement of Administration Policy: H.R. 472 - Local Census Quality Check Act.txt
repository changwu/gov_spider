    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Miller (R) FL and 22 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 472. As stated in the attached March 16, 1999, letter to Chairman Burton, if this legislation were presented to the President, the Secretary of Commerce would recommend that it be vetoed.
H.R. 472 would mandate a post-Census local review that would not be timely, effective, or cost efficient. The Census Bureau is working with local governments to improve address information before the Census, which will provide greater accuracy of the Census within the statutory time frame for its completion.
