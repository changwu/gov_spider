    LITTLE ROCK, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement regarding Republican primaries in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia :
"We lost the battle of the beltway last night, but the beltway is not my turf – the heartland is. We are grateful for those who supported us in those three states, and we gave them both a choice and voice.
"I am also grateful for the support of the icons of the conservative movement, such as Paul Weyrich and James Dobson, who have recently joined my campaign team.
"Looking at the results from the past week, one thing is clear: my message of hope, optimism, and authentic conservatism is in sync with the heart and soul of the Republican Party.
"This is an election, not a coronation, and I owe my supporters an opportunity to have their voice heard, until we have a clear winner.
"I look forward to continuing a cordial dialogue with Senator McCain on the issues that matter to our country and will define the course of this great nation."
