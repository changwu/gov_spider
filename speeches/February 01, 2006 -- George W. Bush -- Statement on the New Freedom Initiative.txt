    Five years ago, I announced the New Freedom Initiative to build on the progress of the Americans with Disabilities Act and more fully integrate people with disabilities into all aspects of life. Since the announcement of this important initiative, we have expanded educational opportunities for children with disabilities and provided essential funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We have launched disabilityinfo.gov to serve as an online resource for people with disabilities and their families, employers, service providers, and other community members. To provide expanded employment opportunities, we are assisting persons with disabilities by implementing the Ticket to Work program and strengthening training and employment services at One-Stop Career Centers.
As a result of these efforts, Americans with disabilities have greater access to the opportunities of America. My administration will continue to work to remove barriers that still confront Americans with disabilities and their families.
