"The young people of America want their future back," Riegle said in a prepared statement. "They refuse to become a lost generation. Bernie is showing them that they can use their own individual power to speak – and organize – and act together – with other concerned citizens of all ages and backgrounds to work as a team – to take back their own government – to break the stranglehold of the special interest money and control."
