CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: We are going to harvest. We're going to pull up some vegetables, right?
CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: And then we're going to make some snacks. Mmm. Well, let me welcome everybody who's here. We've got our tried and true students from Tubman and Bancroft. Where is everybody? Bancroft, raise your hands. Tubman, raise your hands. And where are your teachers? Raise your hands. Where are they? Where are they? There -- say hi to your teachers.
And we have some other guests, as well. We've got some "Let's Move" Twitter fans that are here. (Applause.)
MRS. OBAMA: Twitter fans in the house. You guys ready? Got your thumbs ready? All right. Well, this is going to be exciting. I'm always happy to have you guys here. You know why we do this, right?
CHILDREN: Yes.
MRS. OBAMA: Tell me, why are we here? Yes.
CHILD: Because we have to, like, cook -- and pizzas.
MRS. OBAMA: Pizzas is a good reason to be here. You see that? Having a little pizza.
Why do you think we're here?
CHILD: I think we're here to learn how to stay healthy.
MRS. OBAMA: Ah! Awesome. Yes, to learn how to stay healthy how?
CHILD: By eating healthy and doing exercises.
MRS. OBAMA: Awesome. Wow, you guys have been paying attention, paying attention. What do you guys have to say? Why are we here?
CHILD: For picking vegetables.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah, yeah, but why are we here?
CHILD: We're here because, like, we want to, like, help the White House garden.
MRS. OBAMA: Excellent. Excellent. So you guys have learned some things since you've been here right? Well, we don't just pick these vegetables for the White House. I mean, we are going to eat these vegetables -- the President, me, Malia, Sasha, Grandma. Bo doesn't really eat them.
But we also serve them at our big official functions, and we also share them with some of our neighbors. And we have Miriam's Kitchen folks here -- where are our Miriam Kitchen's people? There you guys go. Always there, always ready. We're going to give some of the food to Miriam's Kitchen, and they serve good healthy food to people who don't always have access to good healthy food. So they've been a partner with us for a very long time, and we're happy to have them.
So I am excited to have you. Do you guys have your assignments?
CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: All right, well let's move! Let's get picking!
