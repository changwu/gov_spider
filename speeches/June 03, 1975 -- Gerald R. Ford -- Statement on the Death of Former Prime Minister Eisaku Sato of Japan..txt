    I WAS deeply saddened to learn of the death of Eisaku Sato. The passing of this great statesman, Nobel laureate, who did so much for his nation and for the cause of peace, is a loss to the world. His service as Prime Minister of Japan won the respect of all nations; his counsel was sought and valued. He was a close friend of the American people and devoted his life to strengthening the ties of understanding and friendship between the United States and Japan. I speak on behalf of all Americans in expressing our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Sato and the Japanese people.
