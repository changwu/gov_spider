    Forbes "Out Of Touch" Says Dole Campaign Manager
A rattled Steve Forbes today defended himself against the revelation that he allowed hundreds of thousand of taxpayer dollars to be wasted during his tenure as Chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting. According to separate reports by two federal investigators, Forbes authorized a $ 500,000 golden parachute for Eugene E. Pell, his hand-picked top bureaucrat, as well as $ 250,000 in taxpayer funds to renovate two apartments in Europe for Pell. Forbes dismissed the money as "infinitesimal."
"Half a million dollars might seem 'infinitesimal' to Steve Forbes, but it's a lot of money to taxpayers in New Hampshire and Iowa," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed, "It just shows how out of touch and disconnected Forbes is from the lives of working Americans."
"In his only government experience, Steve Forbes wasted millions of taxpayer dollars to finance a luxury lifestyle for his cronies," Reed said. "The more people learn about Steve Forbes, the more questions they have."
An audit by the Board's Inspector General (ICY) called for "immediate action"' to end salary padding for Forbes' associates. Wasteful spending uncovered by the IG and the Government Accounting Office (GAO) included:
* A $ 500,000 golden parachute given by Forbes' to Eugene E. Pell, his hand-picked top bureaucrat. Two federal investigative organizations recommended that the government demand the return of this windfall;
* $ 250,000 in taxpayer funds to renovate two apartments for Pell in Europe;
* Tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars lavished on luxuries including Afghan rugs and imported brass lanterns for Pell's apartments;
* $ 1,750 per month to hire gardeners and cleaners.
