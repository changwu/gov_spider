Thank you to @foxandfriends for covering, supremely, the greatest political scandal in the history of the United States, OBAMAGATE.

....Likewise, the @nytimes and @washingtonpost are a disgrace to journalism. They are all Fake News, and they know it better than anyone else. History is unfolding, and it is not a pretty picture for "journalism".Retweets: 22028Favorites: 88372
