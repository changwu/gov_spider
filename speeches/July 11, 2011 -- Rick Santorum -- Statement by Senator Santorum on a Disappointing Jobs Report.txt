    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to this morning's jobs report that found that only 18,000 new jobs were created in the month of June and that unemployment had risen to 9.2%.
"This morning's jobs report is one more sign that the current Administration's policies are impeding economic growth in America," said Senator Santorum. "This past week in Iowa, I laid out a very clear vision for creating jobs and growing our economy. I would urge President Obama to go out and talk to the people in America's heartland and hear their concerns, and I would hope that he would see that they are looking for a President who believes in them again and not continued reliance on ineffective, big government bureaucracies. That is exactly what my plan to eliminate the corporate tax burden for U.S. manufacturers, streamline the patent and FDA approval process, and increase incentives for research and development would do. I look forward to having this debate with the President, because it is clear his plan is not working for America."
