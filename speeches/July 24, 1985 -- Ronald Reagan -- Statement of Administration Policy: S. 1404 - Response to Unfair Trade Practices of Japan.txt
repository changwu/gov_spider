    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senator Packwood (R) Oregon)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of S. 1404, because: (1) it is designed as retaliation against Japan rather than as an inducement for liberalization of Japan's market; (2) it would undercut Prime Minister Nakasone's efforts to open the Japanese market; (3) it would probably end constructive talks with Japan on trade; (4) it could eventually result in a trade war; and (5) the mandatory retaliation contemplated by the bill would represent a clear and unprecedented violation of our international obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
