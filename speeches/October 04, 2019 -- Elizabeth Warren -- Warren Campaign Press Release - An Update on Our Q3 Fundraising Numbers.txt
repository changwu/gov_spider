I've got great news for you.
You might remember that quarterly FEC fundraising deadline we've been talking about.

Well, we're excited to announce our results: We raised $24.6 million in the third quarter of 2019. Thank you for donating to help make it possible.
This means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position — to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth's plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight.
Keep reading if you'd like to take a look under the hood of our fundraising report. But first, I've got a quick and important plug:
What We Raised In Q3

More than 500,000 people making more than 940,000 donations in July, August, and September helped raise $24.6 million
More than 300,000 of those donors gave for the first time in Q3
Our average contribution was just $26

How We Raised It
People like you chipped in.
That's it.
Elizabeth didn't sell her time to wealthy donors, over the phone or in person at closed-door fundraisers. She didn't take any money from Washington lobbyists, corporate PACs, or PACs of any kind.
Instead, she got to spend her time traveling across the country, hosting town halls, taking tens of thousands of selfies, and hearing directly from people about what's on their minds — and people like you chipped in to help make it possible.
Elizabeth says that running for office is an act of optimism. I think that's true of donating to a political campaign, too. When you make a contribution, you're rejecting cynicism — you're recognizing your power in your democracy, and your ability to shape our future.
Ever since Elizabeth announced her presidential exploratory committee last New Year's Eve, hundreds of thousands of people like you have made individual, optimistic decisions to chip in and own a piece of our campaign.
Elizabeth is deeply grateful for your support, and so am I.
