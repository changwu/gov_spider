I am working very hard to help New York City & State. Dealing with both Mayor & Governor and producing tremendously for them, including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won't help them because I don't like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators!Retweets: 32226Favorites: 162796

This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak. He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot! https://t.co/42zpWW9vzyRetweets: 29805Favorites: 158311

Just reported that the United States has done far more "testing" than any other nation, by far! In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!Retweets: 35386Favorites: 195728

The four hospitals that we (FEMA) are building in NYC at the Javits Convention Center are moving along very well, ahead of schedule. Many additional ventilators also delivered. Good conversation with Governor Cuomo!Retweets: 19603Favorites: 100006

The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!Retweets: 49308Favorites: 228659

I hear that Fake News CNN just reported that I am isolated in the White House, wondering out loud, "when will life return to normal?" Does anybody really believe that? There was no leak, they made it up â€“ they are CORRUPT & FAKE NEWS....Retweets: 66452Favorites: 320687
