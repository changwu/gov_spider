    
It reads like your typical political hit piece: anonymous quotes, dramatic insinuations, ominous headline framing:

Except, what's the scandalous revelation?

Marco has a compulsive habit of . . . drinking water.
That's how desperate some folks in the media are to criticize Marco. 
Seriously: Politico, a go-to publication for D.C. insiders, did a lengthy feature on Marco drinking water.
Around the web, folks weren't too impressed:
Politico apparently needs to learn how the human body works... | Marco Rubio's 'water thing' https://t.co/EyvwXGkLMD

Politico released an 1,800 word critique of Marco Rubio drinking water. Lol. Things are getting desperate. — SomethingInYiddish (@AlecEmley) December 7, 2015
Marco Rubio drinks a lot of water? Good! So should you. A good reminder to go get myself a glass.

The good news: You can help out Marco and stay just as hydrated as he is your own campaign water bottle.

Just be careful: Maybe Politico will end up writing a story about you, too.
