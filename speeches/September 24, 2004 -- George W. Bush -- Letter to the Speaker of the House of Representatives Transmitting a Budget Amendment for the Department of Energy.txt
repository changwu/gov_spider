    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendment for the Department of Energy. This amendment replaces a previous amendment transmitted September 7, 2004, and would not increase the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 Budget.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
