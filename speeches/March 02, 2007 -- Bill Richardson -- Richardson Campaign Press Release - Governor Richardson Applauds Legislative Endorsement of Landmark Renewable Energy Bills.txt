The New Mexico House today passed Senate Bill 418 to require that at least 15 percent of an electric utility's power supply come from renewable sources by 2015 and 20 percent by 2020, while the Senate passed the Renewable Energy Transmission Authority (RETA) Act (House Bill 188) to help develop New Mexico's electric transmission infrastructure, planning, and financing. This is the final legislative action on both bills.
"I'm proud that the cornerstones of my clean energy agenda have passed both chambers with bipartisan support," said Governor Richardson. "As two of my top priorities, the Renewable Energy Transmission Authority will enable our state to export solar, wind and other renewable energy and further build our high-wage, and high-tech economy, while increasing our usage of renewable electricity further solidifies New Mexico's stature as the Clean Energy State."
HB 188 is sponsored by Representative Jose Campos and SB 418 is sponsored by Senator Michael Sanchez.
