    Today, Kasich for America announced the expansion of its Young People for Kasich Coalition. The coalition has grown to include the following members:
Dennis Cook (IL)John Doyle (NY)Michael Thulen, Jr. (NJ)Sarah Spence (OH)Rick Veenstra (IL)Courtney Ruwe-Spray (NE)Mike Puskaric (PA)Daniel Ruoss (FL)Clayton Turner (AL)
These young leaders serve together on the executive board of the Young Republican National Federation, the oldest political youth organization in the U.S. They are active in local, state and national Republican politics and will build upon Gov. Kasich's strong grassroots support.
Said Cook, "I'm proud to be part of an organization that has supported outstanding Republican candidates at the grassroots level for over eighty years. This year, there is no doubt in my mind that Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the right candidate to lead our party to victory in November. He has an unbeatable record of bringing people together to produce results â€” from balancing the federal budget to cutting taxes and spurring job creation in Ohio. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the rest of the Kasich team to share John Kasich's positive, conservative message with young voters. Experience matters to young voters and John Kasich is the only candidate who can both win and lead on Day One."
Said Kasich, "It's wonderful to receive the support of these young people. They're the future of the Republican Party and the future of America. I always bring a debt clock to my campaign events in order to remind people of the unsustainable burden we're putting on our children and grandchildren if we don't get our fiscal house in order. For their sake, we have to balance the budget and help bring quality jobs back to struggling communities. I'm honored that these national young leaders have placed their faith in me to lead the charge."
