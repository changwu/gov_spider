    General Franco, Seiora Franco, Your Excellencies, friends of Spain and the United States:
I am most honored to be the first American President to visit Spain since President Eisenhower was here in 1959.
I recall my previous visits to this country and the warm welcome that we have received. As I stand here I bring to all of the people of Spain the best wishes of all the people of the United States.
We Americans owe a great deal to Spain. We remember that it was Spanish explorers who played such a great role in the exploration and the development of the New World; and we in the United States, with diverse people and diverse culture, owe a great debt to the Spanish culture and people of Spanish background who have contributed so much to our Nation.
Since 1953, we have been partners together in defense in the Mediterranean area, and over this past period, particularly in the past 10 years, we have seen increasing economic cooperation between Spain and the United States.
I am confident that the talks we will have here, with you, General Franco, and with the members of your cabinet, will contribute to closer cooperation, both in defense for peace and economic cooperation which will mean progress for all of our people in Spain and in the United States.
In recent weeks, the eyes of the world have been on the Mediterranean area. If we do not have peace in the Mediterranean, world peace will be very seriously threatened. An indispensable pillar for peace in the Mediterranean is Spanish-American friendship and cooperation. For that reason, I say, as I begin my visit to Spain, Viva la amistad Hispano-Americana.
