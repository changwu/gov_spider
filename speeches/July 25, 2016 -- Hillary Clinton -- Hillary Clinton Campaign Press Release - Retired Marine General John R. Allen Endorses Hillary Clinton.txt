    Retired Marine General John R. Allen is endorsing Hillary Clinton for President, citing his trust in her ability and experience to keep our country safe and secure. Allen, who retired as a 4-star General after 37 years in uniform, was Deputy Commander of U. S. Central Command and a former Commander of the International Security Assistance Force, overseeing NATO troops in Afghanistan.
Allen's endorsement comes before Clinton is scheduled to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Charlotte, North Carolina,Â on Monday:
"Through 37 years of service in the U.S. Marine Corps, I saw some of the toughest challenges that our nation faces around the world, and I know that America has the power to meet those challenges. However, it requires continued leadership and engagement in the world, continued partnership with our allies, and a clear understanding of our adversaries. It requires patience and a deep comprehension of the international landscape to make smart decisions about when and how to use military force as well as an understanding that other tools of American power such as diplomacy and development aid - that will armed forces out of harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. And it requires a leader who wants to understand these complex issues and seek advice and counsel. Hillary Clinton is all of those things.
This has been a very personal decision for me. I have stayed out of the political arena my entire adult life, but given the complexities of issues facing our country today and its longtime allies, I felt compelled to speak up and be heard. I have no doubt that she is the leader we need at this time to keep our country safe, and I trust her with that most sacred responsibility of Commander-in-Chief."
