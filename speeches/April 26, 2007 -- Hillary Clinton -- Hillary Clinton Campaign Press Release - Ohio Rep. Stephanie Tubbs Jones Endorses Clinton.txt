    Tubbs Jones will serve as Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Ohio Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones and named her a co-chair of Clinton's national campaign.
"I am proud to be an early supporter of Hillary's candidacy," said Rep. Tubbs Jones. "While the Democratic party has many talented candidates, Hillary has the experience, leadership and vision to make this country a global leader once again. This country is ready for change and I believe Hillary is the right person, at the right time to initiate that change."
Tubbs Jones has led efforts in the House of Representatives to safeguard the voting rights of all U.S. citizens and expand access to health care for low and middle-income families. She chairs the House Ethics Committee and also serves on the Ways and Means Committee.
Prior to being elected to Congress in 1998, Tubbs Jones served ten years as a judge on the Cleveland Municipal Court and the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. From 1991-1998 she served as Cuyahoga County Prosecutor.
"Stephanie is a champion for the families of Cleveland and other cities that have been invisible to this administration," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have her support as we reach out to voters and ask them to help us change America."
