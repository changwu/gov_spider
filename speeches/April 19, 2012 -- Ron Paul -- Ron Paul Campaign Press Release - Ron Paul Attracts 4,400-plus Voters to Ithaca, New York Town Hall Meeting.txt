LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable 4,400-plus supporters and undecided voters to his town hall meeting in Ithaca, New York ahead of the Empire State's Tuesday, April 24th Republican primary.
Ron Paul's town hall meeting occurred at 7:00 p.m. ET at Cornell University's Lynah Rink, located at 536 Campus Road in Ithaca, NY 14853. At the event Dr. Paul discussed his platform of constitutionally-limited government, restoring economic and civil liberties, and elements of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint designed to reign in federal government spending, growth, and interference in the economy.
Ron Paul's Ithaca town hall meeting at Cornell University was organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP). YFP, an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign, launched in September 2011, and since its inception, students nationwide have organized 607 chapters and recruited more than 76,000 people.
