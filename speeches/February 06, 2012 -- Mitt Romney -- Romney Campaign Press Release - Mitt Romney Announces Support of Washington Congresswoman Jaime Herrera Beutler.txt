    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Washington Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler.
"I'm extraordinarily proud to earn Congresswoman's Herrera Beutler's support," said Mitt Romney. "She is a rising star in our party and a staunch advocate for creating jobs through conservative economic policies. I am looking forward to working with her to spread these same ideas to voters throughout the state of Washington."
"Voters in Washington State are looking for a change," said Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler. "Our country simply cannot take four more years of out of control government spending, rising unemployment, and sinking home values. Mitt Romney is the proven leader who has the character and the experience to lead this country. His vision of a 'Simpler, Smaller, and Smarter' federal government is what America needs to get back on track. I urge all those who are concerned about the direction of our country to join me in supporting Mitt Romney."
