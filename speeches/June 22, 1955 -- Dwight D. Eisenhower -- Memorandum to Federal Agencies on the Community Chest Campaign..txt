To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
In the National Capital Area the Community Chest Federation unites six Community Chests and more than one hundred Red Feather agencies or services in one federated campaign to provide local health, welfare and recreational programs vital to the building of a healthy, strong and safer community in which to live, work and play.
To act as Chairman of the Government Unit in this important appeal, I appoint the Honorable Harvey V. Higley, Administrator of Veterans' Affairs.
I ask that you give Mr. Higley your fullest measure of support and assistance and that all persons in authority in the Federal and District Government take a personal interest and extend their complete cooperation to this important charitable appeal. Such cooperation should logically include the assumption of equitable unit goals, the effective solicitation of all employees, and the setting up of an adequate collection method for the convenience of those who wish to make contributions on an installment basis.
To avoid a separate financial appeal the USO-USO Camp Shows will again be included in the Red Feather Campaign. This national and international program continues to be essential to the morale and happiness of our men and women of the Armed Forces both at home and overseas.
It is my hope that all officials and employees will be given the opportunity to contribute voluntarily, and that they will want to do so generously, mindful of the fact that this is one appeal for the yearly support of over one hundred Red Feather agency programs and the USO. Each individual's giving should reflect a fair share towards the support of these worthwhile services for a full year of effective operation.
