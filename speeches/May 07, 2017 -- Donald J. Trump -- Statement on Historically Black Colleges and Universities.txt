    The statement that accompanied my signing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, sets forth my intention to spend the funds it appropriates, including the funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), consistently with my responsibilities under the Constitution. It does not affect my unwavering support for HBCUs and their critical educational missions.
In February of this year, I signed an Executive order pledging to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest quality education, to ensure equitable opportunities for HBCUs to participate in Federal programs, and to increase the number of college-educated Americans who feel empowered and able to advance the common good at home and abroad.
My commitment to the above-stated goals remains unchanged. In a few days, my Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will give the commencement address at Bethune-Cookman University, a school founded by the great Mary McCleod Bethune and committed to leadership and service. Secretary DeVos chose an HBCU as the venue for her first commencement address to demonstrate my administration's dedication to these great institutions of higher learning.
I look forward to selecting an Executive Director and Board for my HBCU initiative and continuing this important work with HBCUs throughout the Nation.
