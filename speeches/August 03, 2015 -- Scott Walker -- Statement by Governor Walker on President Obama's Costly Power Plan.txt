    Manchester, N.H. â€“ Governor Scott Walker today slammed the Obama administration's final rule of far-reaching regulations on existing U.S. power plants unveiled this morning. Walker sent a letter to the president on May 21, 2015 stating the proposal was "riddled with inaccuracies, questionable assumptions and deficiencies that make the development of a responsible state plan unworkable."
"President Obama's plan should be called the Costly Power Plan because it will cost hard-working Americans jobs and raise their energy rates," said Walker. "It will be like a buzz saw on the nation's economy. I will stand up for American workers and stop the Costly Power Plan."
