    Alexandria, VA - In response to Senator Lindsey Graham's performance in tonight's CNBC GOP debate, Lindsey Graham 2016 campaign manager Christian Ferry today released the following statement:
"Yet again, Lindsey Graham is the clear winner in tonight's debate. The first job of the President of the United States is to keep us safe. Only Lindsey Graham showed he is ready to do that tonight. Without national security, there is no economic security.
"The next President of the United States is going to inherit a nation with crushing debt and terrorism on the rise. It is going to take Republicans and Democrats, working together with an experienced leader to fix these problems. Lindsey Graham is ready for the job on day one and the only candidate with a record of bipartisanship to make Washington work. He has the right plan and the experience to get it done.
"No one on either stage tonight has a real plan, like Lindsey Graham, to degrade and defeat the terrorists that threaten our homeland, the terrorists who threaten our families, and the terrorists who threaten our economy. Lindsey Graham will not only defeat and degrade the terrorists, but also has the courage and strategy to degrade our national debt."
