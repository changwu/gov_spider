    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Mitchell (D) Maine)
The Administration strongly supports the enactment of H.R. 3, as passed by the House. The bill authorizes annual increases in the rates of compensation for service-disabled veterans and the survivors of (1) servicepersons who die in service and (2) veterans who die as a result of service-connected conditions.
For FY 1991, the Office of Management and Budget estimates outlays for the increases in the rates of compensation in H.R. 3 to be $412 million. However, these costs are already included in the budget baseline. Since the pay-as-you-go requirements are measured against the baseline, the increases in the rates of compensation in H.R. 3 would be scored as zero under the pay-as- you-go limits.
