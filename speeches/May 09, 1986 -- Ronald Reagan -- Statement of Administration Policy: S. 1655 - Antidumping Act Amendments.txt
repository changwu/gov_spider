    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Senators Specter (R) Pennsylvania and 9 others)
The Administration is deeply committed to enforcement of the current antidumping law, but strongly opposes S. 1655. The bill is unnecessary, and would violate international obligations of the United States under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and invite foreign retaliation against United States exports. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the bill's judicial remedies for dumping would work as quickly or effectively as existing administrative remedies. Finally, the bill's harsh penalties for importing dumped goods would unfairly apply to importers who unknowingly and unintentionally take part in dumping, which could have a chilling effect on legitimate imports.
