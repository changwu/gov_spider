    Today President Bush submitted to Congress the National Security Strategy of the United States as required by the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department Re-Organization Act of 1986. The president's national security strategy reflects the union of our values and our national interest. This strategy states that the safety and security of America is the first and fundamental commitment of the our government.
America must always stand for and protect the universal values on which it was founded. To this end, President Bush makes clear that the United States will use its position of strength and influence in the world to defend, preserve, and extend the peace.
