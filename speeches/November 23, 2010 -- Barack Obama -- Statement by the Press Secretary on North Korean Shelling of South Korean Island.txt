    Earlier today North Korea conducted an artillery attack against the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. We are in close and continuing contact with our Korean allies.
The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action and to fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement.
The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability.
