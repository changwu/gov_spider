    Seattle, WA â€“ Inslee for America announced today that the campaign has over 125,000 unique donors, only 5,000 donors away from meeting the DNC's 130,000 donor requirement to qualify for the September Democratic debates.
"Governor Inslee's grassroots momentum is continuing strong since the Detroit debate," said Inslee for America Senior Communications Adviser Jared Leopold. "Reaching 130,000 donors would send a major sign about the strength of the grassroots movement for climate action. Jay Inslee's clear climate message has put him ahead of all governors and several senators in the race to 130,000 donors."
Jay Inslee is the only candidate who has made defeating climate change the focus of his campaign. Inslee has committed to making climate action the top priority of his White House, and his campaign has received praise from environmental organizations, climate activists, and elected officials for its dedication to this critical issue. Today's announcement demonstrates the strength of the climate movement and puts Inslee within striking distance of meeting the DNC's donor threshold for the September debate.
