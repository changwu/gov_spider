    While President Trump leads the Great American Comeback, reinvigorating our economy with the largest period of job growth in American history, Joe Biden and the Democrats have allowed violent, radical mobs to wreak havoc in our streets. Women for Trump Advisory Board Member Dr. Merlynn Carson and former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova reaffirmed President Trump's commitment to restoring the economy and backing our brave law enforcement while condemning the lawlessness overwhelming Democrat-run cities on tonight's 'Team Trump Online!' broadcast hosted by Trump 2020 Senior Advisor Lara Trump.

"President Trump proves time and time again his first priority is the American people and ensuring prosperity and safety for all of us," said Lara Trump, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "Joe Biden is too weak to stand up to the radicals overtaking his party, and a Biden presidency would lead to the destruction of our economy with his $4 trillion tax hike and embrace of the Green New Deal. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and President Trump is the only leader that will restore our economy to historic heights, ensure these violent mobs are defeated, and Make America Great Again."
