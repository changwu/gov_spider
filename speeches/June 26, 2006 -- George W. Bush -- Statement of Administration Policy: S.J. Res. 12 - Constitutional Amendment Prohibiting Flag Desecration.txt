    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Hatch (R) Utah and 59 cosponsors)
The Administration applauds Congress's efforts to protect the flag, a cherished symbol of national unity and of the sacrifices so many Americans have made in defending the Nation. The Administration supports S.J. Res. 12, which would propose to amend the United States Constitution to authorize Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the United States flag.
