    Vice President Joe Biden spoke today with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to discuss bilateral relations, the tragedy with Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, and the situation in eastern Ukraine. The Vice President and Prime Minister reaffirmed that the United States and Poland are unshakable Allies and strategic partners. The two leaders agreed that a prompt international investigation with safe and unimpeded access was needed to fully investigate the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The leaders also discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine, noting that Russia was supplying weapons and training — including anti-aircraft weapons — to the separatists, with profoundly de-stabilizing consequences. The Vice President and Prime Minister agreed that Russia should immediately and publicly call on the separatists to lay down their weapons and allow full access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site for international and Ukrainian investigators.
