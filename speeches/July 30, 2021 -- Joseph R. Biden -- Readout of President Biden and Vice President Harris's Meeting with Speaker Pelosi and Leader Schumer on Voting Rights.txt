    President Biden, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader Schumer reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, and to the For the People Act (H.R.1, S.1) and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.4). Recognizing the challenges ahead, the four leaders agreed on the importance of advancing legislation reflecting the priorities and values of those two bills, having them pass the House of Representatives and the Senate, and withstand constitutional challenge. The President, Vice President, Speaker and Senate Leader agreed on the moral imperative of passing legislation to protect against voter suppression, electoral subversion, dark money, and partisan gerrymandering and will continue working together toward that goal urgently.
