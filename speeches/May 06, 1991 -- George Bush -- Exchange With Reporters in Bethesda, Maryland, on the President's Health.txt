    Q. Mr. President, what do you think?
The President. I feel all right. I've just got to get over and get back to work, and keep a little monitor going here.
Q. Have you had to change your lifestyle at all or -- --
The President. Go ahead and ask the doctors that, but not as far as I'm concerned.
Q. Are you going to lighten up at all for the next few days?
The President. Well, they said to gradually get back into the athletics and not overdo it, so we won't run today.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. No, it's not caused by jogging. But you ask the doctors; they'll tell you all that. I don't want to get a bad rap on the joggers.
Q. -- -- any particular stress situation?
The President. No. Ask the doctors, because I don't even know that that's the cause.
Q. But is it right now, sir, is your heart beating regularly?
The President. No, it's not in normal rhythm. Ask the doctors what all that means. I've never heard of this stuff before Sunday.
Q. Are you concerned about that at all?
The President. No. If I were concerned I wouldn't be here, I'd be up there.
