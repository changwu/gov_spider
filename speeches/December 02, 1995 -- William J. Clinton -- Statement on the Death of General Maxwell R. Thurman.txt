    We mourn the passing yesterday of Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, USA, Ret., whose dedicated and exceptional service is cherished by everyone who knew of his extraordinary courage, enduring vision, and selfless service. During a distinguished career which culminated in his service as commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command, General Thurman achieved prominence as a disciplined thinker, organizer, and leader. His foresight and leadership in a succession of key recruiting, personnel, military doctrinal development, and training assignments during the 1970's and eighties helped shape the post-Vietnam Army and transform it into the high-quality, ready-to-fight force of today.
To General Thurman's family and friends and to the Army community, I extend my heartfelt condolences. We will remember him as one of America's finest soldiers and most capable military leaders.
