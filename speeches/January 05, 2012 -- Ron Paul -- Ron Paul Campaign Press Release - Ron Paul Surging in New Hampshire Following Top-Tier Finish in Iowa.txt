LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul is in second place in the key early voting state of New Hampshire with a remarkable 24 percent of the vote, according to a new poll.
The Washington Times/Zogby Analytics Poll, taken after the Iowa Caucuses Iowa shows, Rick Santorum with just 11 percent, and Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, and Rick Perry earned just 9, 8, and 1 percent, respectively.
Poll highlights include an acknowledgment that Paul has an opportunity for growth, and that about half of all single voters support the 12-term Congressman from Texas.
"On the heels of his close third place finish at the Iowa Caucus, Ron Paul is polling a strong second place in New Hampshire. From here on out, it is a two-man race between Ron Paul and Mitt Romney given that one of the tickets out of Iowa was a dead-end due to Rick Santorum's glaring lack of viability," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"There are only two campaigns that have the resources and infrastructure to win the Republican nomination - and one of those organizations belongs to Ron Paul," added Mr. Benton.
The poll of 498 likely primary voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points and ten percent undecided, showing Dr. Paul with the potential to catch and surpass Gov. Romney and win the Granite State.
