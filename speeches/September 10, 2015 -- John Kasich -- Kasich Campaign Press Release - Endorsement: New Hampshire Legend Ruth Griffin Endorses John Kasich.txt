Councilor Griffin will serve as a New Hampshire State Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign.
"Governor John Kasich has cut taxes and balanced budgets. His years of national security policy experience will serve our Country well in the war against the enemies of freedom around the world," said Councilor Griffin. "John Kasich believes in people and is committed to helping all Americans, particularly those who live in the shadows, move up and achieve the American Dream."
Ruth Griffin is Chair of the Portsmouth Housing Authority and is a former State Representative, State Senator, and for twenty years served as an Executive Councilor. She is a former Republican National Committeewoman for New Hampshire and was Chair of the George W. Bush for President Steering Committee in New Hampshire.
"Ruth Griffin is an icon in New Hampshire politics, but more importantly, an even better person," said Governor John Kasich. "It's very humbling to be endorsed by Ruth. I could not be more proud to have her on our team in New Hampshire."
A past multiple recipient of New Hampshire's Ten Most Powerful Women Award, Councilor Griffin was honored in May with a Granite State Legacy Award in recognition of her many years of public service and contributions to New Hampshire.
