Student Loan Debt Relief 
Q. Mr. President, if only 75 percent of the people take advantage of the student loan program—do you consider it a success if only 75 percent of the people take advantage of it?

The President's Handling of Classified Documents 
Q. Mr. President, in simple terms, is it ever appropriate for a President just to take home with them classified and top secret documents?
The President. Depending on the circumstance. For example, I have, in my home, a cabined-off space that is completely secure. I'm taking home with me today today's PDB. It's locked. I have a person with me—military with me. I read it, I lock it back up, and give it to the military.
