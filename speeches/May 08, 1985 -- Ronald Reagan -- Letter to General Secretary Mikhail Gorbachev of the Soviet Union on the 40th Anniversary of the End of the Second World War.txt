    Dear Mr. General Secretary:
The 40th anniversary of the victory in Europe is an occasion for both our countries to remember the sacrifice of those men and women everywhere who gave the last full measure of devotion to the cause of fighting tyranny. Together with our other allies, our two countries played a full part in that long struggle. We demonstrated that despite our differences we can join together in successful common efforts.
I believe we should also see this solemn occasion as an opportunity to look forward to the future with vision and hope. I would like our countries to join in rededication to the task of overcoming the differences and resolving the problems between us, and in renewed progress toward the goals of making peace more stable and eliminating nuclear weapons from the face of the earth. By pursuing those goals, we will truly honor those whose memory we commemorate today.
Sincerely,
/ S / RONALD REAGAN
