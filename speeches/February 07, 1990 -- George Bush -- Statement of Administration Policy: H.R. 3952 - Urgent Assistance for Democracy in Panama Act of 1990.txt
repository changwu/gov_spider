    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 31 others)
The Administration supports prompt enactment of H.R. 3952, but has reservations that language in section 104(b)(3) could require the President to reveal negotiations underway with the Government of Panama. A statutory requirement to reveal such negotiations would interfere with the President's constitutional responsibility for conducting negotiations with foreign governments. Enactment of H.R. 3952 would allow implementation of Phase I of the President's Action Plan to Foster Economic Recovery in Panama.
