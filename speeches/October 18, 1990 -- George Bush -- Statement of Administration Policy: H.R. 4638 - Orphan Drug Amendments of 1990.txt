    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4638. The current Orphan Drug Act has been successful in stimulating the development of drugs for rare diseases. Questions have been raised about the appropriateness of a few specific drugs receiving benefits under the Orphan Drug Act. However, the Administration believes that the provisions of H.R. 4638 would jeopardize the incentives provided by the Act for research and development of orphan drugs.
