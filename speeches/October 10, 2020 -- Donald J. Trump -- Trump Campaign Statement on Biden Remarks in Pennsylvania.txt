    "For nearly five decades as a Washington politician, Joe Biden's approach to jobs has been to ship them to China, Mexico, and other foreign nations. He voted for NAFTA, which killed 850,000 American jobs, many of them in manufacturing. He supported Most Favored Nation status for China and backed their entry into the World Trade Organization, which cost the United States 60,000 factories and 3.5 million jobs. On the campaign trail in this election, he has repeatedly declared war on fracking and pledged to end the use of fossil fuels, meaning the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in states like Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, President Trump built the world's best economy once and is already doing it a second time. He has improved our trade deals and stood up to China. Already we have recovered half of the jobs lost to the global pandemic, while it took Biden two full years to recover half of the jobs lost during the anemic economy he oversaw. There can be no mistaking that President Trump has accomplished more in 47 months than Biden has in 47 years as a failed Washington politician."
