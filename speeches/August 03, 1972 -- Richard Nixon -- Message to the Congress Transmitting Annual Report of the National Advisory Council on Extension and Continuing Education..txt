    To the Congress of the United States:
The Sixth Annual Report of the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education is submitted herewith. The Council is authorized by Public Law 89-329.
I congratulate the Council on its comprehensive study of the Federal role in community service, extension and continuing education for adults through the resources of colleges and universities. The study points up the need for increased coordination of the support the Federal government lends to these efforts.
Several of the Council's proposals are receiving thorough consideration by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, including those relating to improved coordination of Federal assistance to extension, community service, and continuing education programs.
The Council also recommends that additional funds be provided for the program authorized by Title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965. I continue to hold as a basic principle that greater emphasis should be placed on broad funding approaches for Federal grant-in-aid programs, and that narrow categorical grant programs such as Title I should be relied on less as a means of channeling Federal funds to individual institutions.
