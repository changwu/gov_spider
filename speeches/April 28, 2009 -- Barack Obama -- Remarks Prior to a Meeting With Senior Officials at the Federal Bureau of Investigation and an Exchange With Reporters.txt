    The President. Hello, everybody. Good to see you. I'm really looking forward to having a chance to talk to Bob and the rest of his team. He has been integral in many of our national security conversations, our counterterrorism strategy. I am extraordinarily pleased with the job that the Director has done not just during my tenure in office, but preceding me.
By all accounts, the FBI has done an outstanding job of transitioning during an age of terrorism, cyber threats, a whole host--identity theft--a whole host of new challenges. They have been able to adapt. And with the Director at the helm, I have very, very great confidence that the FBI will continue to help keep the American people safe.
I'm also pleased to see that there's been, I think, greatly improved coordination between the FBI and State and local law enforcement officials, something that had not always been there previously. I think it's been greatly improved over the last several years.
So this gives me, basically, an opportunity to hear directly from the FBI, and to say thank you to all the dedicated agents and everybody who's out there working in the field to keep us safe each and every day.
All right.

The President. No--no questions----
Q. ----over New York City yesterday, sir?
Q. Are you concerned about New York City yesterday, sir, with the Air Force plane?
The President. It was a mistake, as was stated. It was something we found out about along with all of you, and it will not happen again.
Thank you.
