    HOUSTON, Texas â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement in response to the announcement that former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has suspended his campaign for President:
"Gov. Rick Perry is a friend and a remarkable public servant. He is a proud veteran who bravely served our nation, and he was an extraordinary governor of Texas. As Texas Solicitor General, it was an honor to serve under him.
"Because of his principled leadership as the longest-serving governor in the state's history, Texas has become a haven for freedom, entrepreneurship, and limitless opportunity. The entire Republican field was unquestionably made stronger by the experience and wisdom he brought to the race.
"In honor of his passion for our veterans, Heidi and I have today made a personal contribution to both the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation and the Lone Survivor Foundation, in honor of Rick and Anita Perry, and we encourage everyone else to do the same."
"We wish Governor Perry, Anita, Griffin, and Sydney the very best in what is certain to be decades of continued service to our Nation."
