Subject: Oil Portraits of Cabinet Secretaries
The Office of Management and Budget has informed me of an outdated practice, that I believe should be discontinued.
As I understand it, past Cabinet Secretaries have commissioned oil portraits, at Government expense, as a method of maintaining an official, historical record of the line of succession of Cabinet Secretaries. Although the practice has existed for over a century, these portraits have become an unnecessary luxury costing anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000.
While this practice might have been justified in the past, color photographs to record the line of succession of Cabinet Secretaries appear more appropriate now. This alternative is consistent with my commitment to save the taxpayer's dollars.
I am sure you will agree that this is another excellent opportunity to convey to the American people our sincere desire to revise wasteful spending practices. Therefore, I ask that you discontinue this practice and in the future use color photographs to record the line of succession.
