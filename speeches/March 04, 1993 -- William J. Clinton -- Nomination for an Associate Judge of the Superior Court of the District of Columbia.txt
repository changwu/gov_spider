    The President has nominated Russell F. Canan to be an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In doing so, the President discharged his responsibility under local law to select a nominee from a list of candidates originally submitted last year by the District of Columbia Judicial Nominating Commission.
"I was impressed with all of the candidates," said the President, "but Russ Canan stood out because of his broad support within the District of Columbia legal community, including Mayor Kelly's personal recommendation, and because of the impressive track record he has accumulated in 16 years of law practice in Washington. Above all, we heard nothing but the highest praise for Mr. Canan's professional skills and talents from those who know his work the best: the many judges on the Superior Court before whom he has practiced."
