    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Ford (D) Kentucky and 24 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1277, and the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill or any similar legislation. The Department of Transportation already has sufficient statutory authority to enforce safety, financial fitness, and citizenship requirements.
The inflexible and cumbersome review procedures required by S. 1277 would not enhance, and could well detract, from the Department of Transportation's ability to address fitness problems. The bill is also inconsistent with long-standing national policies of welcoming foreign investment and allowing the market to allocate resources without unnecessary regulatory interference.
