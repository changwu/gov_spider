    Denver, CO - Hickenlooper 2020 announced today that the campaign raised over one million in primary dollars in less than 48 hours since the Governor's announcement. Hickenlooper is only one of four Democratic primary candidates to reach that level of early support. The campaign received donations from all 50 states and does not accept corporate PAC money.
"The surge of support and enthusiasm for the Governor is clear," said Finance Director Dan Sorenson. "Governor Hickenlooper's record of bringing people together and delivering real results on health care, climate, and gun reform is resonating across the country."
Sorenson spent last cycle as the Deputy National Finance Director for the DCCC working for Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Previously, he served as the Colorado and New Mexico Finance Director for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Ashley Kennedy, Tonya Fulkerson and Sarah Paulos of FK&CO serve as the campaign's fundraising consultants. They previously served on the finance teams of several Democratic U.S. Senators, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Brendan Koch serves as the campaign's deputy finance director. In 2018, he served as the deputy national finance director for Senator Jon Tester.
