Orlando, FL – Today, Governor Mitt Romney released the following statement strongly supporting U.S. Senator Jim DeMint's (R-SC) efforts to stop wasteful spending of the taxpayers' money in Washington. Senator DeMint's amendment will help reform the spending process in a way that brings more transparency and accountability.
"Senator DeMint has shown both courage and conviction for standing by his reform principles and resisting those on Capitol Hill who want to preserve the status quo on wasteful spending. Senator Harry Reid and Capitol Hill Democrats need to recognize that Washington can't continue to pile earmarks onto spending bill after spending bill. Instead, they should embrace Senator DeMint's amendment and stand up for taxpayers and fiscal responsibility."
Background Information On Senator DeMint's Reform Amendment
Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) Garnered Bipartisan Support To Pass Earmark Reform. "Nine Democrats joined with Republicans in support of stricter House-passed rules on lawmakers' pet projects, known as 'earmarks' - demonstrating the fragility of the Democratic Party's thin Senate majority. ... The measure, an amendment to an ethics and lobbying bill, would have adopted a wider definition of 'earmarks' - specific projects inserted in bills – to include Corps of Engineer water projects, Pentagon weapon systems and items from other federal entities. ... 'If we're going to go through all this process, if we're going to change the laws and try to tell the American people that now you can see what we're doing, let's don't try to pull the wool over their eyes,' said Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., sponsor of the amendment." ("9 US Senate Democrats Split With Reid Over 'Earmark' Rules," The Associated Press, 1/11/07)
