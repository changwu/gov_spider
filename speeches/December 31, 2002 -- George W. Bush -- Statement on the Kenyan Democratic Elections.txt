    I congratulate President Mwai Kibaki on his election as the third President of the Republic of Kenya and look forward to working with him. I also congratulate the Kenyan people who on December 27th demonstrated their deep commitment to democracy and provided to the world a clear example of peaceful, democratic change. And I commend former President Moi for his leadership and vision during this crucial period of democratic transition and for his years of leadership in the region.
The elections have opened a hopeful new chapter in Kenya's history. I commend the Presidential candidates, Uhuru Kenyatta and Simeon Nyachae, for peacefully accepting the outcome of the election and for pledging to work constructively within the democratic framework of the National Assembly. The United States will work closely with Kenya's new Government to deepen the strong and enduring friendship between the United States and Kenya and to help the new Government build a future of greater freedom, peace, and prosperity for all of Kenya's citizens.
