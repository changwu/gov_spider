    I want to thank Representative Boren for his years of service representing the people of Oklahoma's Second District in the United States Congress. Over the course of his career, both in Washington and in the Oklahoma Legislature, Dan has exemplified a commitment to creating jobs and economic opportunity for his constituents and rural communities, all the while continuing his family's long line of public service and dedication to the State of Oklahoma. I commend him for his service and wish him well in his future endeavors.
