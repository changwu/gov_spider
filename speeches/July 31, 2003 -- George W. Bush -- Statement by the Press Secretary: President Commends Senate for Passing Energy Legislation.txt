    The President commends the Senate for passing energy legislation that will help America meet our future energy needs and boost the economy. Together, the House and Senate energy bills include the major conservation and environmentally responsible production measures needed to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy. We must increase our energy independence and the President looks forward to working with the conferees to ensure that we enact a balanced and comprehensive energy policy this year.
