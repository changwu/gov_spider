Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that 14 New Jersey conservative leaders have joined the Romney for President Team. Many of these leaders joined Romney for State Chairman State Senator Joe Kyrillos at a Romney for President event held in Parsippany today.
In making the announcement, Governor Romney said, "I'm glad to have the support of so many conservative leaders in New Jersey. People all over the country are concerned about the uncertainty in the economy, and I have the experience and the plan to keep our economy strong. I believe we need to cut personal and corporate taxes, improve education and make health care more accessible. I look forward to working with these leaders to make sure we earn the support of as many New Jersey voters as possible leading up to the February 5 primary and beyond."
