    Madison, Wis. -- Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement today regarding Secretary of State John Kerry's visit to Cuba:
"Opening a U.S. embassy in Havana rewards the Castro dictatorship and undermines the Cuban people. Secretary Clinton's support for President Obama's misguided Cuba policy further demonstrates why she is unfit to be commander-in-chief.
"As president, I would not make sweetheart deals with dictators. Instead, I would focus on facilitating greater freedoms for the Cuban people and securing relief for those harmed by the Castro regime's oppression."
