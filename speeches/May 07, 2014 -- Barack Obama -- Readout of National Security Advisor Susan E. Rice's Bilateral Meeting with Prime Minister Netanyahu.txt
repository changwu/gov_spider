    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu today in advance of the U.S.-Israel Consultative Group consultations, to be held tomorrow (May 8). They discussed a wide range of regional and bilateral issues, including the United States and Israel's close security cooperation, which has been unprecedented under President Obama's leadership. On Iran, Ambassador Rice emphasized the critical importance of pursuing a comprehensive solution that assures the international community that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. She reiterated that the United States will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, and that diplomacy is the best way to resolve the international community's concerns peacefully. Ambassador Rice told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States will continue intensive consultations with Israel as P5+1 and the EU negotiations continue.
On Israeli-Palestinians negotiations, Ambassador Rice noted that, while we have come to a pause in the parties' talks, the United States remains convinced that lasting peace can only be secured through direct negotiations that lead to two viable, independent states living side-by-side in peace and security.
Finally, Ambassador Rice and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed global and regional issues including Syria and Ukraine.
