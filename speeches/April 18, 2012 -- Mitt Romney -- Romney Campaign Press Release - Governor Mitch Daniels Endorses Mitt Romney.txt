    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels.
"Governor Daniels' leadership and service in Indiana should be an example to public officials across the country," said Mitt Romney. "Governor Daniels shares my background in business, and he has used the principles of the private sector in government. Indiana has been served well by his leadership based on fiscal discipline, smaller government, and a friendly environment for job creators. I am honored to have his support and look forward to working with him to fix our economy and get our country on the right track."
Announcing his support, Governor Mitch Daniels said, "Mitt Romney has earned our party's nomination and now deserves the support of every American still committed to government that serves the people rather than rules over them. The ruinous debts and anti-enterprise policies of today threaten more than our near-term economy; unaddressed soon, they will end the promise of upward mobility that our nation has always offered to its young and its poor. And they will end the U.S. leadership which has promoted peace and progress around the world for so many decades. Mitt Romney has proven that he understands what is at stake and is prepared to summon Americans to the changes that will restore the American Dream and our national greatness. I'll do whatever I'm asked to help him."
