    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
The 1995 Federal U.S. Savings Bonds Campaign will soon be underway. Attached is a special message to all Federal employees who are eligible to take part in this campaign. Please give this letter appropriate distribution within your organization to enhance your campaign.
I encourage you to also generate a letter for each of your Department or Agency employees. Good luck on a successful campaign. I look forward to receiving your results later this year.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
