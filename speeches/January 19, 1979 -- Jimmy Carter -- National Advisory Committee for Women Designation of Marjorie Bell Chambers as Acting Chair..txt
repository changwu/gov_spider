    The President today announced that he will designate Marjorie Bell Chambers as the Acting Chair of the National Advisory Committee for Women. The designation of Chambers was recommended by the Committee on the basis of a poll of its membership.
In this temporary assignment, Chambers' initial task will be to work with Sarah Weddington to expand the access of the Committee to policymaking forums within the administration. The White House anticipates a solid working relationship with the Committee and will continue to consult with it and seek its advice. The Committee will work to effectively fulfill its mandate of assisting the President and the administration in promoting full equality for American women.
The White House will continue to consult with Chambers, the Committee, and former members of the Committee on the selection of a permanent chair and the continuing role of the Committee.
Chambers, 56, of Los Alamos, N. Mex., is president of Bell Chambers Associates, a consulting firm for government, education, science, and technology, specializing in equity management services. She is national president of the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and president of the AAUW Educational Foundation. She is a former president of Colorado Women's College and has also been a professor of history at several colleges. She has served as chairman of the County Council of Los Alamos.
