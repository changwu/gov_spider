    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Owens (D) NY and 7 others)
The Administration has no objection to H.R. 2127. The Administration supports reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act and will be proposing legislation to reauthorize programs under that Act in the near future. H.R. 2127 extends the Act's authorizations of appropriations for one year. This extension will permit a full consideration of the Rehabilitation Act programs and policies through the regular authorization process.
The changes in H.R. 2127 to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are acceptable the Administration. They will serve as a temporary delay in the requirements for States to implement fully important services for disabled children. A more effective permanent solution may be required later.
