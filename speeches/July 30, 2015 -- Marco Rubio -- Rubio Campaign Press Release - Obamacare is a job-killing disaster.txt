Last year, national health care spending grew by 5.5% — the biggest increase in seven years. Over the next ten years, it will increase by an average of 5.8%, despite President Obama's claim that the massive law would "bend the cost curve" down.
President Obama was wrong, and so is his failed health care law. It is a job-killing disaster filled with new spending, taxes and mandates that are increasing the cost of care, stifling innovation, and busting the budget.
It's not too late to start over. As President, I will repeal Obamacare and replace it with consumer-centered reforms that not only lower health care costs for millions of Americans, but get federal spending under control. Doing so will not be easy, but it is necessary to restore health care choice, competition, and fiscal responsibility in America.
