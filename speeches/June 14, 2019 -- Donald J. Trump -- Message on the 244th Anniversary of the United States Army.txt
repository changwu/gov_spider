    As Commander in Chief, I am pleased to join our grateful Nation in celebrating the 244th birthday of the United States Army. For nearly two and a half centuries, the United States Army has been synonymous with duty, honor, and discipline. As part of the most elite fighting force the world has ever seen, our soldiers fiercely defend our national security at home and abroad. From the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States Army has been instrumental in ensuring that America remains a shining beacon of hope and freedom around the world.
Last week, we commemorated the 75th anniversary of D-day. The United States Army's role was paramount to the success of Operation Overlord on that day and our subsequent victory in the European theatre of World War II. Seventy-five years later, the men and women of the United States Army continue to fearlessly execute their roles as the guardians of freedom. Today we commend our brave soldiers, both past and present, for their steadfast resolve, their vigilant defense of the values we hold dear, and their love of country.
May God watch over all the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.
