    Alaska Senator and Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Lisa Murkowski made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"Governor Romney understands that abundant, affordable energy is crucial to every aspect of a strong economy. I am pleased to see him roll out an energy plan that is clear-eyed in its focus and has the boldness to realize we can be independent of OPEC imports by 2020 if we make the proper choices. I look forward to working with President Romney to put his plan for America's energy into action."
