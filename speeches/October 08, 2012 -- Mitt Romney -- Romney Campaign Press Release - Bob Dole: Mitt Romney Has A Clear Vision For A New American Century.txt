    Former U.S. Senator Bob Dole today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"Governor Romney has presented a clear vision for a new American century. By honoring the principles that have guided our Republic, he leaves no uncertainty or ambiguity about our exceptional role in the world. The world needs America back. And Mitt Romney has provided us that badly needed direction and resolve to restore our standing in the world."
