    Following the lead of advocates and reformers, Beto is the only 2020 presidential candidate with a plan that calls for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Earlier today, at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention, Beto passionately shared his vision for an America defined not by fear and hatred, but by its aspirations and the resolve of its people to unite to see them realized.

Beto shared his belief that the bold leadership of advocates and reformers?like the students marching for their lives?will ensure that we make healthcare a universal right, pass a reparations bill, and rewrite our immigration laws in our image. He also differentiated himself as the only 2020 presidential candidate with a plan that calls for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons.
"This is a country that has produced the leadership that will ensure that we not only have universal background checks, red flag laws, and end the sale of those weapons of war, but that we go the necessary steps further?as politically difficult as they may be," said Beto. "A gun registry in this country, licensing for every American who owns a firearm, and every single one of those AR-15s and AK-47s will be bought back so they are not on our streets, not in our homes, and do not take the lives of our fellow Americans."
As he did today in New Hampshire, Beto will continue speaking difficult truths, leading with honesty, and advocating for immediate action to end the culture of hate and violence in our country.
