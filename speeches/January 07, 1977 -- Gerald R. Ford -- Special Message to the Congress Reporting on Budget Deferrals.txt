    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report four new routine deferrals of funds totalling $685.0 million. The deferred funds were provided for the U.S. Railway Association and the U.S. Information Agency.
In addition, I am reporting routine revisions to five deferrals previously transmitted. They relate to programs of the Departments of Commerce and Health, Education, and Welfare, the General Services Administration, and the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. The combined effect of the revisions is to increase the amount deferred by $130,000.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
