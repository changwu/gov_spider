    The news of the death of Jesse Owens saddens our Nation. Perhaps no athlete better symbolized the human struggle against tyranny, poverty, and racial bigotry.
His personal triumphs as a world-class athlete and recordholder were the prelude to a career devoted to helping others. His work with youth athletics, as an unofficial ambassador overseas and as a spokesman for freedom, are a rich legacy to his fellow Americans.
Rosalynn and I send our deepest condolences to his wife and children and to the countless friends he made in a lifetime of service.
