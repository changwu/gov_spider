Big Rally in Louisiana on Friday night. Must force a runoff with a Liberal Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards who has let your Taxes and Car Insurance get too high and will never protect your 2nd Amendment. Vote for one of our two great Republicans on Saturday force a runoff!Retweets: 14047Favorites: 55615

Gasoline Prices in the State of California are MUCH HIGHER than anywhere else in the Nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren't doing the trick! Don't worry California relief is on the way. The State doesn't get it!Retweets: 21790Favorites: 92767
