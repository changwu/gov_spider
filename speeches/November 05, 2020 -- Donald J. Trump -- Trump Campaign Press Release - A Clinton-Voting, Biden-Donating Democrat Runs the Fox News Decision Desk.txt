    A Democrat operative put his finger on the scale and declared Joe Biden the winner before the votes were counted.
Arnon Mishkin, the director of Fox News' election decision desk, prematurely called Arizona for Joe Biden before hundreds of thousands of ballots had been counted. Even left-leaning election analysts like Nate Silver have criticized the decision, but Mishkin is standing by his terrible decision despite and refusing to retract his unjustified call.
Why would Mishkin put his finger on the scale for Joe Biden before so many votes are counted? Mishkin is a registered Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, worked as a Democrat political consultant, and has a long record of donating to Democrats, including the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign.
As the votes are counted, President Trump continues to cut into Joe Biden's lead in Arizona. Five major election decision organization have refused to follow Mishkin's lead and call the race in Arizona, because they know what the Arizona Republic knows: "Trump received almost the exact share he would need to charge back to win Arizona's 11 electoral votes and potentially reelection."
As the News-Herald in Arizona said today, "Arizona [is] still in play"! Fox News (and the AP) must immediately rescind their call in Arizona.
