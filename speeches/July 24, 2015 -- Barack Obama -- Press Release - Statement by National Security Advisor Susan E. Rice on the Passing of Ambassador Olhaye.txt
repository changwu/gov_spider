    I wish to offer my deepest condolences on the passing of Djiboutian Ambassador to the United States Roble Olhaye. Ambassador Olhaye was the longest-serving Ambassador to the United States, a tireless advocate for Djibouti, U.S.-Djiboutian relations, and a personal friend. We mourn the passing of Ambassador Olhaye, a forceful promoter of trade between Africa and America, even as we celebrate a cause to which he contributed so much, the long-term renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ambassador Olhaye's family and loved ones, and we take solace knowing that his legacy lives on in our strong ties with Djibouti and the broader continent.
