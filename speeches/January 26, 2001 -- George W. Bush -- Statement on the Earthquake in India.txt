    I am saddened by the news of the tragic earthquake centered in India's Gujarat state this morning. I extend my condolences and those of the American people to the families of the many victims in the cities and villages of Gujarat and elsewhere. Earthquakes know no political boundaries: I send condolences to the people affected in neighboring Pakistan as well. We stand ready to assist as needed and as desired by the Governments.
