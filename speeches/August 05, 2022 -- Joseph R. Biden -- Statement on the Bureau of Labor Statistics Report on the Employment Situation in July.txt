    Today the unemployment rate matches the lowest it's been in more than 50 years: 3.5 percent. More people are working than at any point in American history. That's millions of families with the dignity and peace of mind that a paycheck provides. And it's the result of my economic plan to build the economy from the bottom up and middle out. I ran for President to rebuild the middle class. There's more work to do, but today's jobs report shows we are making significant progress for working families.
