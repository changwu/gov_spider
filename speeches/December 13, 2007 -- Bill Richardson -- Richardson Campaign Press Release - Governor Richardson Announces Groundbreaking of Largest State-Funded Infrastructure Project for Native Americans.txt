    SANTA FE-- Governor Bill Richardson has announced the groundbreaking of New Mexico's largest infrastructure project to serve Native Americans. Today's groundbreaking is part of a $15.3 million project connecting Native American and non-Native American communities in New Mexico.
"I am pleased to see construction begin on the largest state-funded infrastructure program aimed at improving the quality of life of Native Americans," said Governor Richardson. "The people of the Navajo Nation deserve to have access to a dependable water supply, and this project is a tremendous step forward."
This is the first phase of a $15.3 million project allocated to build a pipeline connecting Indian and non-Indian communities through the Eastern Navajo Reservation in Western New Mexico to safe, clean water. The communities of Torreon, Ojo Encino, Whitehorse Lake, Counselor, Nageezi, Huerfano and Burnham will benefit from the new pipeline.
The Eastern Navajo Water Supply project will provide a dependable water supply to hundreds of people in western New Mexico and the eastern Navajo Nation and enhance their quality of life.
This project was a priority of Governor Richardson's Year of Water and is a result of a government-to-government partnership between the Navajo Nation and the state of New Mexico.
