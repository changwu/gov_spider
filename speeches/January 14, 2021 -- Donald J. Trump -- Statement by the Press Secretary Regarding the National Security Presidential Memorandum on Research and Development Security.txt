    Today, President Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum on Securing United States Government-Supported Research and Development. This Presidential action strengthens the protections of United States Government-supported research and development (R&D) against foreign government interference and exploitation.
The open and collaborative nature of the United States R&D enterprise underpins America's innovation capacity, science and technology (S&T) leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security. Today's action by President Trump ensures that Government-supported research can occur in an open environment and foster new discoveries for the benefit of our Nation while also protecting intellectual capital, discouraging research misappropriation, and ensuring the responsible management of United States taxpayer dollars.
America must remain the world's leader in S&T during this era of great power competition, and today's signing builds on the long and successful history of actions taken by President Trump to protect American technology from adversaries. This whole-of-government approach to R&D security will protect America's technology and innovation advantage. Whether in trade, military cooperation, or S&T research, President Trump refuses to let other countries take advantage of America.
