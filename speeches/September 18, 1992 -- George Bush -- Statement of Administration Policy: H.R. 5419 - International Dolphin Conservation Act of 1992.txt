    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/21/92)(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and 49 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5419. The approach taken in the bill builds upon efforts by the Administration to protect dolphins.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 5419 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimate for this bill is that its net pay-as-you-go effect would be zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate. If H.R. 5419 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
