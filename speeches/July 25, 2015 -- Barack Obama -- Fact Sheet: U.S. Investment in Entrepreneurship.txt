    President Obama and President Kenyatta opened the 6th annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), co-hosted by the United States and the Government of Kenya, and announced new commitments to promote entrepreneurship as a driver for economic growth, social inclusion, and secure communities. Following his historic 2009 Cairo speech, President Obama elevated innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. engagement agenda and hosted the first GES at the White House in 2010. Over the past six years, the United States has been a leader in catalyzing entrepreneurship globally by developing innovative ecosystems; advocating for stronger business climates through rule of law and transparent business conduct; promoting entrepreneurship for women, youth, and marginalized communities; and mobilizing the private sector to expand impact.
GES 2015, held in Nairobi, Kenya, is the first summit held in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the entrepreneurial dynamism of the continent. The summit brings together approximately 1,000 outstanding entrepreneurs and investors from across the world for dynamic, outcome-oriented sessions; mentoring; and opportunities to showcase their work. With a strong focus on African-based solutions, the summit showcases how investors and entrepreneurs from other regions of the world can connect with the continent in new ways. GES has become a preeminent annual gathering that provides emerging entrepreneurs with exceptional networking, insight, and investment opportunities.
At the 2014 GES in Marrakesh, Morocco, the U.S. Government set a goal of sparking $1 billion in new private investments over the next three years for entrepreneurs worldwide. President Obama issued a call to action in May to governments, companies, organizations, and individuals to help reach that target. Today, President Obama announced over $1 billion in new commitments from banks, foundations, philanthropists, and the U.S. Government, with half of that money going to support youth and women entrepreneurs.
U.S. Investment in African Entrepreneurs 
President Obama announced that the U.S. Government is committing significant new resources to advance entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa:

• The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will support up to $200 million for Equity Bank Group lending of $450 million in foreign currency, with a focus on youth and women, to small and medium enterprises over the next five years.
• OPIC signed a memorandum of understanding to explore OPIC financing of $100 million in Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women and the International Finance Corporation's Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, extending debt investments to help support financial institutions supporting women-owned small and medium enterprises worldwide.
• OPIC announced the  Portfolio for Impact program, a two year, $50 million pilot program that will support smaller earlier stage companies that generate positive social impact. The first three commitments under this program support companies focused on expanding their operations in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Private Sector Impact
President Obama has called upon the private sector to lend their support to entrepreneurs around the world through capital mentorship, training, and partnerships. At GES 2015, private sector companies around the world committed to train and mentor over 1 million burgeoning entrepreneurs and pledged nearly $700 million of capital to the next generation of entrepreneurs:

Impact of U.S. Government Entrepreneurship Programs
U.S. Government entrepreneurship programs and partnerships developed and implemented over the past six years have been instrumental in driving entrepreneurship around the world:

• The State Department's LIONS@FRICA and TIGERS@MEKONG Partnerships strengthen the technology and innovation entrepreneurship ecosystems across Africa and the Lower Mekong region respectively. Within a year of its inception, LIONS@FRICA reached approximately 2,000 entrepreneurs and mobilized more than $75 million in new commitments from Microsoft.
• USAID's Partnering to Accelerate Entrepreneurship (PACE) Initiative, started in 2014, continues to catalyze private-sector investment into early-stage enterprises and identify innovations that help entrepreneurs bridge the gap between early stage and scale-up funding. PACE has created six public-private partnerships and 163 entrepreneurs have been reached, catalyzing $34.4 million in funding for early stage entrepreneurs.
• The Department of State's Global Entrepreneurship Program (GEP) has worked with UP Global to introduce StartUP Weekends and other UP Global signature programs to U.S. embassies, consulates, and entrepreneurial contacts worldwide. UP Global now boasts 726 communities and approximately 7 percent of businesses that are created through StartUP Weekends are acquired or go public.
• USAID and the Department of State's GEP formed an alliance to support Centers for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) in Tunisia and Morocco.
