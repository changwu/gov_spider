    I am very pleased today to acknowledge the efforts of President Bush, President Carter, and President Ford in convening a group of prominent citizens for NAFTA. Never before have former Presidents joined forces to speak to the Nation about such a pressing issue.
This group includes distinguished Americans who have demonstrated achievement in such diverse fields as government, industry, and civil rights. These individuals have taken many paths to prominence, but they have come to a common conclusion that this trade pact is good for America and good for America's economic fortunes.
This debate is fundamentally about creating jobs and defining America's role in an increasingly competitive global economy. Our fundamental choice is whether we will respond to change and create the high wage jobs of tomorrow or attempt to cling to the jobs of the past. America is always at its best when we look to the future.
While I continue to be concerned about America's rate of economic growth, it is increasingly clear that exports are a key factor in boosting our economy. NAFTA represents the best immediate opportunity to expand our markets and create new jobs at home.
I am increasingly confident that this agreement will be approved by Congress. When thoughtful people look at the facts about NAFTA, they will come to the same conclusion as this group of distinguished Americans. I am hopeful that this group will elevate the debate about NAFTA and participate vigorously in the discussion about which direction America should take.
