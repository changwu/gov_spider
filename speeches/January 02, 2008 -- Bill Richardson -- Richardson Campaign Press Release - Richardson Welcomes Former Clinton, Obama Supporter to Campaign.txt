    Switch shows caucus goers still deciding, indicates race is still wide open
CENTERVILLE, IA-- Today Governor Bill Richardson welcomed Susan Klopfer as a new supporter to his campaign.
"We welcome Susan and the tens of thousands of other supporters that have decided to stand with me on caucus night," Richardson said. "This just shows how fluid the race still is and the momentum my campaign is seeing on the ground. We are surging. We are confident we will surprise folks with a strong finish on Jan. 3."
As NBC reports, Klopfer had been volunteering for Hilary Clinton. She later switched her support to Barack Obama.
But after hearing Richardson speak yesterday, Klopfer again changed her position and decided to caucus for the New Mexico Governor on January 3.
"In both [Clinton and Obama], I didn't see the experience that I'd like to see and kind of the groundedness that I'd like to see," Klopfer told NBC.
Klopfer added: "Probably I'll caucus for Richardson."
"Like Susan, caucus goers across Iowa are looking for real experience, proven results, and someone who can bring true change to Washington," Richardson said. "There are a tremendous amount of undecided Iowans still out there. And as they begin to decide who they will support on caucus night, I am confident they will see me as the most experienced candidate in the race and the one best ready to lead on Day One."
