    Manchester, NH -- Hundreds of Obama supporters went door-to-door in 47 towns today to share Senator Obama's plan to turn the page in Iraq as part of our nationwide Canvass for Change. These canvasses come less than two weeks after thousands of Obama supporters across the country highlighted Senator Obama's judgment opposing the Iraq War in 2002 at Rallies for Change.
"Five years ago this week, while other Democrats were lining up behind George Bush, Barack Obama stood to the politics of the moment and opposed the war in Iraq," New Hampshire State Director Matt Rodriguez said. "In 47 towns across the state today-and in towns all across the country-Obama supporters are talking to their neighbors about the judgment we need in our next President. That's how real change happens."
Obama supporters in New Hampshire canvassed the following towns today: Allenstown, Antrim, Bedford, Boscawen, Bow, Claremont, Concord, Conway, Derry, Dover, Durham, Exeter, Franklin, Goffstown, Grantham, Greenfield, Greenland, Hampton, Hancock, Hanover, Hooksett, Jaffrey, Keene, Kingston, Laconia, Lebanon, Littleton, Londonderry, Manchester, Merrimack, Milford, Nashua, New London, Newmarket, Peterborough, Pittsfield, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Rochester, Salem, Sanbornton, Somersworth, Stratham, Tilton, Whitefield, Wilton, and Wolfeboro.
