LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul is polling in second place in the key early voting state of New Hampshire, according to poll averages calculated by Real Clear Politics.
The poll averages reveal Paul has 20.8 percent support, nearly double the support of third-place rival Rick Santorum, whose poll average totals a mere 10.6 percent. Mitt Romney leads with 40.2 percent in these polls, which were taken from January 1st to 7th.
Jon Huntsman, who has prioritized a New Hampshire win, polls on average just 9.4 percent.
Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have on average just 8.6 and 1 percent, respectively.
"Ron Paul is polling a solid second place in the 'Live Free or Die' state, where his message of personal and economic liberty resonates well. At media-staged debates where theater trumps discussion of today's pressing issues, voters are encouraged to choose from establishment candidates, big government conservatives, and those unviable in New Hampshire and elsewhere," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"New Hampshire voters know better and that is why Ron Paul's voter outreach events, ads, and other message delivery efforts are yielding a respectable degree of growth. As in Iowa, we are hoping for a strong top-three finish and our top-class organization is well prepared for the final push," added Mr. Benton.
