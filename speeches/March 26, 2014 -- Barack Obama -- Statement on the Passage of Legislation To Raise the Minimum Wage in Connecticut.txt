    Today the Connecticut Legislature took an important step towards raising the State minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and giving more Connecticut workers the raise they deserve. When I visited Connecticut earlier this month, I was joined by Governor Malloy and three of his fellow New England Governors, who represent just a few of the many States, cities, and counties across our country working to raise their minimum wages. I support these efforts, and I commend Governor Malloy for his leadership. But to truly make sure our economy rewards the hard work of every American, Congress must act. I hope Members of Congress, Governors, State legislators, and business leaders across our country will follow Connecticut's lead to help ensure that no American who works full time has to raise a family in poverty and that every American who works hard has the chance to get ahead.
