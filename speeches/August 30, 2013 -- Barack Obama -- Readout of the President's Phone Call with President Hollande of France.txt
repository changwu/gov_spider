    The President and President Hollande spoke today as part of their continuing consultations regarding the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons on August 21. The two leaders agreed that the international community cannot tolerate the use of chemicals weapons and must hold the regime accountable and send a strong message that the use of chemical weapons is not acceptable. The United States and France are close allies and friends, and we will continue to consult closely with France on Syria and other global security challenges.
