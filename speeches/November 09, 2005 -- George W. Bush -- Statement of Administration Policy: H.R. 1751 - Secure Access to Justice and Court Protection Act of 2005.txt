    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Gohmert (R) Texas and 9 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1751 to strengthen judicial security. The legislation would enhance the ability of the Federal government to prosecute individuals who attack or threaten participants in the Nation's judicial system, including judges, lawyers, and witnesses. A Nation founded on the rule of law must protect the integrity of its judicial system, which must apply the law without fear or favor. Enactment of this bill is important to vindicate the essence of the rule of law. The Administration also supports the provision to prohibit the filing of false liens against judges, prosecutors, and other government officials to retaliate against them for the performance of their official duties. The Administration does not believe the provision requiring consultation between the Federal courts and the Marshals Service is necessary, as such consultation occurs on a regular basis all around the country, but the Administration does not oppose the provision. Further, the Administration does not believe that the creation of new grant programs should be a priority at this time. The Administration opposes Section 22 of the bill, added during committee markup, that would allow media coverage of Federal court proceedings under certain circumstances. While the Administration understands the public interest in viewing trials, the Administration believes Section 22 has the potential to influence court proceedings unduly and to compromise the security of participants in the judicial process. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to address constitutional issues raised by certain provisions of this bill and to enhance judicial security through this bill and other measures.
