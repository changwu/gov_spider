    Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 has raised over $800,000 since Wednesday night's debate, marking a sharp uptick in fundraising support since Cory Booker's standout debate performance.
Additionally, Thursday, November 21st, is now the second-best online fundraising day of Cory's campaign for president to date -- second only to Wednesday, November 20th.
"Cory differentiated himself on the debate stage by drawing from his lived experience and showing that he not only has the policy agenda to lift struggling families, but the temperament and leadership style needed to unite the party to defeat Donald Trump," said Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie. "It's clear that voters liked what they heard, and want to keep him on the December debate stage so they can hear more about how Cory will heal our country and deliver real justice and opportunity for everyone."
