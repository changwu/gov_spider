    President Bush will welcome King Abdullah of Jordan to Washington for a working visit on September 28. The United States and Jordan share many vital interests in the Middle East. Jordan is a strong partner of the United States in combating terrorism, as well as in the pursuit of regional peace. The President looks forward to discussing with King Abdullah ways to deepen our cooperation against terrorism.
The two leaders also will discuss the importance of promoting peace and stability in the Middle East, including by encouraging Israeli and Palestinian efforts to end violence and return to dialogue.
This will be the King's second visit to the White House this year; he met with the President previously on April 10.
