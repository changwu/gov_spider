    Today the White House released the United States Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan.
The United States has long been a leader in maritime security, including in countering the threat of piracy. Since 2009, the United States has organized and led the international effort that has seen successful pirate attacks decline off the coast of Somalia dramatically.
In the spirit of this leadership and in ensuring safety at sea, the United States developed the Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan. This Plan implements the National Strategy for Maritime Security, and the Policy for the Repression of Piracy and other Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea. The United States will continue to seek to strengthen regional governance and rule of law to maintain the safety and security of mariners, preserve freedom of the seas, and promote free flow of commerce through lawful economic activity.
The Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan provides clear strategic guidance for counter-piracy efforts and outlines that the United States will use all appropriate instruments of national power to repress piracy and related maritime crimes. The Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan focuses on three core areas: Prevention of Attacks, Response to Acts of Maritime Crime, and Enhancing Maritime Security and Governance; and provides specific frameworks for the Horn of Africa and Gulf of Guinea regions. These frameworks establish the tailored and specific methodology for these regions and provide guidance on how the United States will respond to the regional threats associated with the varying geographic, political, and legal environments.
The "Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan" supersedes the "Countering Piracy off the Horn of Africa: Partnership & Action Plan" of 2008.
