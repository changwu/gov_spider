If an accident occurred and you needed major spinal surgery, which of the following would be you choose: (a) the esteemed medical professor, (b) the recent graduate of orthopedic school, (c) the orthopedist who operates on knees or (d) the orthopedist who has performed thousands of successful spinal surgeries?
Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson seem to be like the "a" group â€” intelligent but with no experience in running a government. As a state senator for 11 years, I can tell you that it is totally different than running a business. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are less qualified because they have no executive experience.
Being a governor is helpful experience for the chief executive of the United States, and Jeb Bush is at least familiar with running state government, but he has no experience dealing with Congress.
However we have one candidate who has all the experience: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who had 16 years in the Congress, including on the Armed Forces Committee, and worked with President Reagan on balancing the budget. He was such a successful governor that he was easily re-elected in a swing state.
We do not need another president who will learn on the job. The future of our country needs to be in the hands of an experienced person such as John Kasich. Why my friends cannot see that baffles me.
