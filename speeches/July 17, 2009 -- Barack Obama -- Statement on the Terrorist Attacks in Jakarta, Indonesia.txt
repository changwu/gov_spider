    I strongly condemn the attacks that occurred this morning in Jakarta and extend my deepest condolences to all of the victims and their loved ones.
The American people stand by the Indonesian people in this difficult time, and the U.S. Government stands ready to help the Indonesian Government respond to and recover from these outrageous attacks as a friend and partner.
Indonesia has been steadfast in combating violent extremism and has successfully curbed terrorist activity within its borders. However, these attacks make it clear that extremists remain committed to murdering innocent men, women, and children of any faith in all countries. We will continue to partner with Indonesia to eliminate the threat from these violent extremists, and we will be unwavering in supporting a future of security and opportunity for the Indonesian people.
