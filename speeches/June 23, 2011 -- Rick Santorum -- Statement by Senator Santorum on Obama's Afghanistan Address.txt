    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to President Obama's speech regarding the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan:
"President Obama speaks of winding down our engagement in Afghanistan, but he does not emphasize the need for victory," said Senator Santorum. "Every American wants our brave men and women home safely, but we cannot let those who've given the last full measure die in vain by abandoning the gains we've made thus far. We must be squarely focused on succeeding in Afghanistan rather than on politically motivated troop withdrawals. Sadly, President Obama doesn't seem to share that commitment."
