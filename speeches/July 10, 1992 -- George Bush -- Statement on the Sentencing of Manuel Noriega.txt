    The sentence imposed today on Manuel Noriega is a fitting punishment for drug crimes that have harmed all Americans. It demonstrates that international drug felons are not above the law, no matter how great their wealth, their status, or their armed might.
Illegal drugs inflict great suffering throughout our Nation and the world. Anyone who trafficks in them should be brought to justice. Operation Just Cause freed the people of Panama from a brutal tyranny; the sentence handed down today demonstrates that it also led to the conviction and just punishment of an unrepentant drug criminal. For that, Americans and our allies abroad have reason to be proud.
