    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
"As approved by Director for Rules Committee."
(House Rules)(Vento (D) MN and 72 others)
If H.R. 1484 were presented to the President, the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend that he veto the bill. This bill's limitation on the President's authority to remove the Director of the National Park Service, and the exemption from Presidential review of the Director's legislative and budgetary recommendations to Congress, represent an unwise and unconstitutional impairment of the unitary powers of the Executive branch. Moreover, the removal of the Director from the supervison of the Secretary of the Interior would reduce accountability and be contrary to sound management principles.
