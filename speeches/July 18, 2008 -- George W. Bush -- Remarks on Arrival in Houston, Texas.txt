    Congressional Candidate Pete Olson
It sure is good to be back in Houston, Texas. I am—I've come back to help Pete Olson win the congressional seat in the 22d Congressional District. I'm proud to support him. He's a Rice University graduate; he went to the University of Texas Law School; Navy fighter pilot; proud father, loyal husband, and a smart guy.
I—our country faces some big issues, one of which is to make sure we defend our homeland against coldblooded killers. I'm convinced Congressman Olson understands that. We've got to make sure we keep our taxes low. And one thing is for certain: We need to explore for more oil and gas here at home. People are worried about the high gasoline prices. One way to take the pressure off gasoline prices is to make it clear that the United States is going to be active about finding crude oil and natural gas right here in our own hemisphere, in our own country. And I'm convinced we can do so in environmentally friendly ways.
No doubt in my mind, Pete Olson will make a fine United States Congressman, and I'm proud to be here to support him.
