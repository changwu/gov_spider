My dear Sir:
Some time ago the original script of your treatise on Ellerstadt and its generation of Hubers in the first half of the 18th century was transmitted to me together with a picture of the old church at Ellerstadt, described by you in your monograph.
I take this occasion to thank you kindly for your treatise, the contents of which are of great interest to me and other members of my family.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
