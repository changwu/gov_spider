    We are following events in the region closely and our representatives are in touch with all interested parties. We hope the Palestinian legislature will continue to act in a way that empowers the prime minister to fight terror and bring a better way of life to the Palestinian people. The creation of the office of prime minister was a key turning point for the Palestinian Authority in the development of new institutions to serve all the people, not just a corrupt few tainted by terror. The prime minister must be supported by a cabinet committed to fighting terror, political reform, and rooting out corruption.
At this critical moment, it is important that all parties consider carefully the consequences of their actions. We remain committed to implementation of the roadmap, working with Israelis, Palestinians, Arab States who seek peace, and our Quartet partners to realize the vision outlined by the President on June 24, 2002.
