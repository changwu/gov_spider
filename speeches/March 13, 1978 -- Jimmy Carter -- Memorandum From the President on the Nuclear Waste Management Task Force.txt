    Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, Chairman, Council on Environmental Quality, Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy, Assistant to the President for National Security AffairsSubject: Interagency Nuclear Waste Management Task Force
By this memorandum I am establishing an interagency Nuclear Waste Management Task Force to formulate recommendations for establishment of an Administration policy with respect to longterm management of nuclear wastes and supporting programs to implement this policy. I have asked the Secretary of Energy to chair this Task Force.
The Department of Energy is issuing a draft report setting forth preliminary views on key issues in the waste management area. This report should serve as the basis of initial discussion for the Task Force. Areas which should be considered, leading to establishment of an Administration policy for nuclear waste management, include wastes from commercial nuclear power operations, existing lowlevel, transuranic (TRU), and high-level defense wastes. In addition, on-going programs should be reviewed to assure that the policy is implemented in a timely manner. Attention should also be given to the necessity of legislation, environmental assessment, support for our non-proliferation objectives, and budgetary impacts including potential involvement in waste management programs by private industry.
The deliberations of the Task Force should include opportunity for appropriate participation by the interested public, industry, States, and Members of Congress.
I am directing that the activities of the Task Force be initiated by March 15 and final recommendations should be completed by October 1, 1978.
JIMMY CARTER.
