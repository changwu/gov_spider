    (Denver, CO) – The Clinton campaign announced its Colorado for Hillary LGBT Steering Committee at a kick-off event last night with Senator Jennifer Veiga. The LGBT Steering Committee will organize support for Hillary in Denver and across the state.
"Hillary Clinton will end the divisive politics of the past seven years and move our country toward the promise of fairness and equality for all Americans," said State Senator Jennifer Veiga.
"Clinton has fought hard to end the politics of fear and discrimination. She will be a strong advocate for the LGBT community as President," said Anthony Aragon, community activist.
"Hillary has been a longtime friend of the LGBT community. As President, she will continue fighting to make sure all Americans have equal rights and benefits," said Stan Griffith, a Hillblazer and realtor.
Clinton has been a strong advocate for LGBT Americans. As a U.S. Senator, she has worked to expand federal hate crimes legislation and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. As President, she will sign this legislation into law, end the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and work to ensure that all Americans have equal benefits – from health insurance and life insurance, property rights, and more.
