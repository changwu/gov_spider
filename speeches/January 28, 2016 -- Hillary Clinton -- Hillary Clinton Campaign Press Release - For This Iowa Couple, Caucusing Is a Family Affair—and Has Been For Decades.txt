When Iowa holds the nation's first caucus in less than a week, Jim and Karen Gorham will be there—just as they've been to every single caucus since 1972.?
This year, they'll be caucusing for Hillary Clinton.


The Gorhams live in Washington, Iowa—halfway, as they like to say, between Washington D.C. and Washington State.

"One of the things that's been really good about our 55 years together is that our ideas have grown together," Karen says.
For Jim and Karen, politics have been close to home from the start.
The first time they caucused together, they volunteered to run their neighborhood location. Since Washington is such a small town, they decided their home was as good a place as any. 
They're proudly doing everything they can to pass this family tradition down to the next generation.

Karen and Jim remember when they first realized caucusing was having an effect on their children.
"When our son was 5, maybe 6, at school they were required to make a banner for the caucuses. So he made his banner with McGovern, and everybody else made theirs with Nixon. He came home and told us that story, and we thought, ?Hmm, at that young age they're picking up things already.'"
This year, there's a lot on the line.

And the Gorhams are ready to do their part to help elect Hillary Clinton—and keep the Republicans out of the White House.

"We've never had a chance," they say, "since we started voting in 1960, to vote for somebody that has the issues that are closest to us in her heart. We have four granddaughters and two daughters. That's as personal as you can get for us. Hillary Clinton focuses on things that will make a huge difference in our daughters' lives."
