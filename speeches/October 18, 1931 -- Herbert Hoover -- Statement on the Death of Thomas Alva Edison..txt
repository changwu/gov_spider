    THE PRESIDENT said:
"It is given to few men of any age, nation, or calling to become the benefactor of all humanity. That distinction came abundantly to Thomas Alva Edison whose death in his 85th year has ended a life of courage and outstanding achievement. His lifelong search for truth, fructifying in more than a thousand inventions, made him the greatest inventor our Nation has produced, and revolutionized civilization itself. He multiplied light and dissolved darkness; he added to whole wealth of nations. He was great not only in his scientific creative instinct and insight but did more than any other American to place invention on an organized basis of the utilization of raw materials of pure science and discovery. He was a rare genius. He has been a precious asset to the whole world.
"Every American owes a personal debt to him. It is not only a debt for great benefactions which he has brought to every American, but also a debt for the honor he brought to our country. By his own genius and effort he rose from a newsboy and telegrapher to the position of leadership amongst men. His life has been a constant stimulant to confidence that our institutions hold open the door of opportunity to those who would enter. He possessed a modesty, a kindliness, a staunchness of character rare among men. His death leaves thousands bereft of a friend, the Nation bereft of one of its notable citizens, and the world bereft of one of its greatest benefactors. I mourn his passing as a personal friend over a quarter of a century."
