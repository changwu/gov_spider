Over the past few days, a lot of folks are talking about "Marcomentum." Check it out:

While Marco's surging campaign has certainly led to a lot of recent mentions of Marcomentum, the word was actually coined way back in April of last year, by Scott Yeager on Twitter:
#MarcoRubio #Marcomentum is going to sweep the GOP primary and lead to the Wh!

After Marco's dominant performance in the last debate, this tweet featuring Marcomentum went viral:
Focus Group on @marcorubio: electable, game-changer, positive, strong, articulate, believable, not negative. #gopdebate #Marcomentum
