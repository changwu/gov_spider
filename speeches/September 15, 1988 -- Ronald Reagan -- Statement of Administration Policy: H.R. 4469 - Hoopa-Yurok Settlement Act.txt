    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bosco (D) CA, Coelho (D) CA, and Miller (D) CA)
The Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend that the President veto H.R. 4469, unless it is amended to delete a provision requiring a gratuitous Federal contribution of $15 million to the Hoopa-Yurok Indian settlement. The Federal Government has no liability with regard to the intertribal dispute that this Act would resolve, and there is no justification for a Federal contribution.
The Administration, therefore, urges that H.R. 4469 not be considered under suspension of the rules, and that it be amended accordingly.
