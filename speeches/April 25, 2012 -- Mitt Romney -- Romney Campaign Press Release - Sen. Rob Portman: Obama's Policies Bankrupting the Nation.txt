    Ohio Senator Rob Portman made the following statement on the announcement of President Obama's upcoming campaign rally in Columbus, Ohio:
"After three and a half years, it is clear that President Obama does not have a plan to get spending under control or our economy back on track. In less than two weeks, President Obama will be in Columbus, where he will argue for four more years of the same failed policies that have produced record unemployment and skyrocketing gas prices. Mitt Romney has a plan to create jobs, reduce spending, and restore America's promise. Our country can't afford four more years of President Obama - it is time to put a proven leader with the record to back it up in the White House. That is why I support Mitt Romney and why Ohio will support him in November."
