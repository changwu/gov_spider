    Despite repeatedly promising to release a health care proposal, President Trump has never offered a plan of his own. Instead, he cheered on attempts by Congressional Republicans to rip health care away from more than 20 million Americans, and sides with Republicans in North Carolina who stand in the way of expanding Medicaid coverage to more than 700,000 North Carolinians. During a pandemic that has infected nearly 200,000 North Carolinians and cost 3,300 lives in the state, President Trump is currently trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to take us back to the days where as many as 4.1 million North Carolinians with preexisting conditions could be charged more or denied health care coverage entirely. If President Trump succeeds, he will also increase prescription drug costs for many seniors, and eliminate their access to free recommended preventive services, including vaccines.
As President, I will bring people together to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, lower health care costs for working families and seniors, and ensure that all Americans have access to the quality, affordable coverage they deserve.
