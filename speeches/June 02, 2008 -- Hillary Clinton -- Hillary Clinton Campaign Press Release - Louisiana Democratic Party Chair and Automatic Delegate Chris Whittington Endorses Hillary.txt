    Louisiana Democratic State Party Chair and automatic delegate Chris Whittington announced his support for Hillary Clinton today.
"Hillary Clinton has what it takes to turn around our economy and rebuild the middle class," Whittington said. "There is no question that she is the strongest Democrat to go toe-to-toe with John McCain in a general election. It is our responsibility as automatic delegates to choose the candidate we believe best fit to beat Senator McCain. That candidate is Senator Clinton."
Whittington was elected Chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party in January 2006, after serving as the Party's Legal Counsel, as a member of the Democratic State Central Committee and as a member of the Democratic Party Executive Committee.
