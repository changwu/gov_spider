Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large 'Caravans' of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws.....Retweets: 19753Favorites: 76422

...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to do their job. Act now Congress our country is being stolen!Retweets: 23709Favorites: 90143

DACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime!Retweets: 23176Favorites: 90936

Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!Retweets: 19555Favorites: 77338

So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke.Retweets: 19085Favorites: 82200

Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!Retweets: 18414Favorites: 77519

So sad that the Department of 'Justice' and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!Retweets: 21137Favorites: 80206
