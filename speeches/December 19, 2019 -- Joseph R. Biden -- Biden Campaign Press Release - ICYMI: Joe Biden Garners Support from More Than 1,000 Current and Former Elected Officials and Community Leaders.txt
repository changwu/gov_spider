    Joe Biden has now amassed more than 1,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, mayors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
The endorsements represent the diverse coalition that Biden is putting together across the country. The influential leaders come from a variety of key states — including early states and Super Tuesday states — critical to the Democratic nomination and ensure Democrats are positioned to defeat Donald Trump.
