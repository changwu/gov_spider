    COLUMBUS, OH -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Ohio Small Business Leaders for John McCain. Dozens of Ohio small business owners endorsed McCain's economic proposals, joining business leaders across the country who have praised his Jobs for America plan to grow the economy as president.
"Small businesses are an engine for job growth in Ohio, and with John McCain's leadership they will only grow stronger," said Ohio Speaker of the House Jon Husted. "John McCain understands that the key to creating jobs and getting our economy back on track is to promote and encourage small business, not to stifle it."
Jim McGregor, president of McGregor Metalworking Companies, added, "Raising taxes on small business not only hurts entrepreneurs, it hurts every worker. That's why John McCain's plan to reform the tax code and keep tax rates low is critical to keeping good jobs here in Ohio."
John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan yesterday, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states. During his visit to Portsmouth, Ohio tomorrow, John McCain will continue to discuss his comprehensive blueprint that will create millions of good American jobs, ensure our nation's energy security, get the government's budget and spending practices in order, and bring relief to American consumers.
