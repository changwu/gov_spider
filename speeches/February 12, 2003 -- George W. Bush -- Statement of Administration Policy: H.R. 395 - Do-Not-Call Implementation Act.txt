    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Reps. Tauzin (R) Louisiana and Dingell (D) Michigan)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 395. The bill recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of Americans in their own homes and protecting them against unwanted intrusions from telemarketers. To that end, individuals and families should be given the tools they need to reduce the number of unwanted calls from telemarketers. Therefore, the Administration supports the establishment of a national "Do-Not-Call" registry and believes that enactment of H.R. 395 will facilitate the implementation of such a registry. The expeditious passage of H.R. 395 would help ensure collection of the funding necessary to give consumers a powerful new tool to reduce unwanted telemarketing solicitations.
