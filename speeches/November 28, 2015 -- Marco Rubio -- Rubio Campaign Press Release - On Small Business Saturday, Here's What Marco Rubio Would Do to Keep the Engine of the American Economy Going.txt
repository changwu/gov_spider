Marco knows that small businesses are a key piece of American prosperity: They grow the economy, keep our communities vibrant, and offer ordinary Americans a chance to pass a living onto the next generation.
Unfortunately, the torrent of new taxes and regulations enacted in recent years have made it harder and harder for small businesses to get by and compete with their larger competitors.
Marco will take a number of steps to help make businesses competitive again, especially through reforming our outdated, burdensome tax code and our cumbersome system of federal rules.
He has a plan to limit the overall cost of federal regulations, which disproportionately impact small businesses. New rules from ObamaCare and the EPA in particular are forcing employers to spend their hard-earned money on compliance, instead of hiring new workers and expanding.


    
  
He'll also reform our tax code so that it's optimized for growth, and no longer taxes small businesses at a higher rate than larger corporations. Under Marco's plan, no business will pay more than 25%, and job creators will be able to immediately expense the cost of investments like equipment and machinery.


As President, Marco will fight for small businesses.
The American economy couldn't have become what it is without them â€” and we won't be able to compete in the 21st Century without them, either.
