    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on Parliamentary buildings in Kabul today that killed at least 38 Afghans and wounded more than 70. An attack on Parliamentary facilities and lawmakers is clearly an assault on Afghanistan's efforts to build democratic institutions. We also strongly condemn the terrorist attack today in Kandahar that killed at least seven people and wounded 18, including the United Arab Emirates' Ambassador to Afghanistan and several Emirati diplomatic personnel, and the suicide bomb attack in southern Helmand province today that killed at least seven Afghans, including both civilian and military personnel. We commend the Afghan police and other security forces who bravely responded to these attacks, and fully support Afghan efforts to bring those responsible to justice. The United States stands with the people and Government of Afghanistan as we work together to build a more secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan.
