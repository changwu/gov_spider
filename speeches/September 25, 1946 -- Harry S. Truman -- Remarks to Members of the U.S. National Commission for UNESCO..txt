    Thank you Mr. Benton:
I have to keep this handshaking arm in good trim during election year--and to a bipartisan group it's good exercise!
It's a pleasure to have you here. I think this organization can, if it will, contribute as much as any other organization--in connection with the United Nations--to the peace of the world.
It is understanding that gives us an ability to have peace. When we understand the other fellow's viewpoint, and he understands ours, then we can sit down and if there are differences work them out.
If there is no understanding, there can be no peace; and if there is no education, there can be no peace. If we can exchange educators with all the countries in the world, and send ours to those countries to show our viewpoint, it won't be long until we have the world situation as we have it in the 48 States--we don't have any difficulties, or any insoluble difficulties, between the 48 States that can't be settled on a peaceful basis. The reason for that is that we understand each other.
I am extremely interested in this organization. I think it can make the greatest contribution in the history of the world to the welfare of the world as a whole, if it really goes at it in the spirit that is intended.
From what Mr. Benton has told me about the people you have elected to your official positions, I believe that you are on the road to do the job. That's all I ask of you.
There are two things in the world I want above everything else--peace in the world and unity at home. That's what I have been fighting for since I have been here. That's what President Roosevelt was fighting for while he was here.
You can make that contribution on a world basis. I want you to do it.
Thank you very much.
