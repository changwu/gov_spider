    #TeamJulián is growing larger every day! To keep the momentum going, we're calling on his supporters in every state to join our movement and become a volunteer!
Build Your Team
Our biggest ask of you is to organize your own community. We need you to build your own Team Julián! A team that can host events, spread the word and mobilize voters. We'll provide everything you need — training, resources and a network of your fellow volunteers.
Host a Debate Watch Party
You can start by planning a debate watch party! On Wednesday, July 31st, Julián will return to the national stage and debate Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and six others. Cheer him on with fellow supporters at your very own watch party!
When you sign up to join the team, check out our resources on organizing your community to access a watch party guide, order a starter kit, and post your event.
Be a Virtual Volunteer
We know that your time is valuable. That's why we created an 'online virtual field office' where we post projects daily that can be completed from the comfort of your own home! Plus, in our virtual field office, you can make connections with staff and other volunteers on Team Julián.

There are many important elements of a campaign, but there is no path to victory without organizing! Join the thousands across the country in the Team Julián family by lending your voice to our grassroots movement.
