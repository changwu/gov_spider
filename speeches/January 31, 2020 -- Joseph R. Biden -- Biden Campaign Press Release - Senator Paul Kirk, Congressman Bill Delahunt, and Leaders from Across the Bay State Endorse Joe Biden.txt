    Boston, Massachusetts â€” Today, former United States Senator Paul Kirk, former United States Congressman Bill Delahunt, and over 35 leaders from across the Bay State announced their endorsement of Joe Biden for President.
"By experience and qualifications, former Vice-President Joe Biden will be best prepared and equipped on January 20, 2021 to restore a patriotic spirit of unity and a culture of public service defined by decency, civility, inclusion, bi-partisanship, and constitutional order. Uniquely, he will immediately be held in the highest esteem, trust, and confidence by other world leaders. Politically, when the stakes for our democracy could not be higher, Joe Biden will be the strongest asset to our Democratic senate nominees in the 'must-win' battleground states in November. I have known Joe Biden since his days on the Wilmington City Council. His character, authenticity, decent human spirit and seasoned, steady statesmanship will be gifts to our nation at its hour of maximum need for a more hopeful and progressive future," said former Senator Paul Kirk.
"Years before we worked together to champion the International Violence Against Women Act, then-Senator Joe Biden wrote and passed the original Violence Against Women Act -- landmark legislation that changed the way our country handles domestic and sexual violence. Biden fought for years to pass the Violence Against Women Act, refusing to give up as he gave a voice to those in our communities who are too often silenced. I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for President because I know that he'll be able to bring people together, get things done, and move our country forward." said former Congressman Bill Delahunt.
"This campaign is quite simply about the character of our nation and that is why I am proud to support Joe Biden for President. Vice President Biden is a man of great character and integrity who understands the soul of our nation and who will fight to protect it each and every day. Joe Biden knows America and we know him. He understands the hopes and dreams of Americans and the challenges people face in their pursuit and he will restore America's place in the world and Americans' confidence in the presidency. Joe and Jill Biden have dedicated themselves to making the lives of others better. That's the kind of leadership we need in the White House.," said former CEO of the DNC Steve Kerrigan.
"I am pleased to endorse Joe Biden for president. One of the key reasons is his practical approach to ensuring access to healthcare for all, and in my opinion he is THE candidate who can beat Donald Trump," said former MA Commissioner of Public Health Cheryl Bartlett, RN
