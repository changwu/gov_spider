    Three in a Row: "Sen. Hillary Clinton's decisive win in Saturday's Nevada Democratic presidential caucus" is her third consecutive victory. According to the Las Vegas Sun, "Clinton clearly connected with voters - they understood she has the right ideas to jump-start the economy and to provide universal health care" as she overcame institutional hurdles and nasty negative ads to win Nevada.
Tremendous Support: According to a CNN entrance poll, Latinos voted for Hillary by an overwhelming margin, 64 percent to 26 percent for Sen. Obama. Hillary also won union members, women and men, and low- and high-income voters. She won rural areas and in and around Las Vegas, including seven of the nine at-large precincts set up essentially for members of the Culinary Workers Union, who endorsed Sen. Obama.
If You Read One Thing Today: "Want to impress me? Come up with something that has an immediate impact on people's lives" writes Washington Post personal financial columnist Michelle Singletary before embracing Hillary's plan to jumpstart the economy. Read it here.
Momentum in Missouri: "An estimated 4,000 people showed up" to hear Hillary in St. Louis last night. "An hour before the doors officially opened, the high school gym was already full - as were the halls outside, a neighboring cafeteria and another meeting room."
Endorsement Watch: Reps. Silvestre Reyes and Loretta Sanchez recently endorsed Hillary.
In Case You Missed It: Sen. Obama thinks "it's fair to say that the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10-15 years." During that time period, Republicans sought to privatize Social Security, abolish the minimum wage, give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, run up huge deficits, and overturn Roe v. Wade.
