    Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"Bob Dole believes all gun, not just handguns, should be kept out of the hands of domestic abusers. That's why the Dole instant check initiative would prevent anyone under a court order for stalking or harassing their spouse from purchasing any gun -- rifle, shot gun, or handgun.
"If Bill Clinton is as serious about domestic abuse as he would like for us to believe, why has his Justice Department prosecuted only 19 individuals under the Violence Against Women Act which Bob Dole ushered through the Senate? As long as he is explaining shortcomings an this issue, Bill Clinton might also explain why, as of last month, his Administration had released just $ 473,000 of the $ 175 million appropriated by Congress for the Department of Justice's Violence Against Women program?
"Dealing with America's epidemic of domestic violence will take touch laws and tough prosecutors, not more empty rhetoric."
