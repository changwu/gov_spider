    I am grateful for the confidence Iowans have placed in me, as tonight we defeated three former sitting governors and two previous Iowa Caucus winners. Regardless of how the media has attempted to marginalize me and my campaign, I still have the highest favorability rating and have remained among the leading candidates in every major survey.
For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it. Even tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains to announce that I had suspended my campaign - in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes.
One of the reasons I got into this race was to stop these deceptive and destructive practices, and these reports have only further steeled my resolve to continue and fight for 'We The People,' and return control of the government back to them.
I want to thank Ryan Rhodes, Iowa State Director, who has led an incredible team of staff and volunteers. His leadership and their commitment to building a strong ground game will provide the momentum needed to move forward to the next state contests, in New Hampshire, South Carolina - and beyond.
