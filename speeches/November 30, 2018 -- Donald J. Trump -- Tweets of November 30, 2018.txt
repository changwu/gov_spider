'This demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between Trump and the Russians. Russian project legal. Trump Tower meeting (son Don) perfectly legal. He wasn't involved with hacking.' Gregg Jarrett. A total Witch Hunt!Retweets: 19109Favorites: 73215

Alan Dershowitz: 'These are not crimes. He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner. I don't see any evidence of crimes.' This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately.

Just signed one of the most important and largest Trade Deals in U.S. and World History. The United States Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!Retweets: 27974Favorites: 125660
