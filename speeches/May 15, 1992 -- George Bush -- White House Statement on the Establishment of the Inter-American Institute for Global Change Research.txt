    The President today announced that the United States has joined 10 other countries of the Americas in signing an agreement that will formally establish an Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research. The Institute will bring together the resources and capabilities needed to address important issues of global change in the Western Hemisphere.
The agreement was signed this week by D. Allan Bromley, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, at a meeting hosted by President Lacalle of Uruguay in Montevideo.
The President first announced the concept of a network of regional institutes to study global change in his closing remarks to the White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change, which was convened by the President in April 1990. Since then, the United States has actively developed this concept and promoted the establishment of the first of these institutes which will be located in the Western Hemisphere. The United States will continue to work with senior representatives in the areas involved to establish institutes in the European/African region and in the Western Pacific region.
This agreement reflects the President's commitment to global stewardship and his desire to promote responsible environmental policies. It is consistent with his conviction that major decisions on the environment should be based on a sound, informed understanding of the scientific issues involved.
