    "Mitt Romney and I are running because we believe that Americans are better off in a dynamic, free-enterprise-based economy that fosters economic growth, and opportunity and upward mobility instead of a stagnant, government-directed economy that stifles job creation and fosters government dependency." — Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "We owe every child a chance to succeed in life in this country. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, we owe them 'an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.' Upward mobility is the central promise of life in America. But right now, America's engines of upward mobility aren't working the way they should.
 
"Mitt Romney and I are running because we believe that Americans are better off in a dynamic, free-enterprise-based economy that fosters economic growth, and opportunity and upward mobility instead of a stagnant, government-directed economy that stifles job creation and fosters government dependency.
 
"You know, there's is something wrong in our country when 40 percent of children born to parents in the lowest fifth of earners never know anything better. The question before us today — and it demands a serious answer — is how do we get the engines of upward mobility turned back on, so that no one is left out from the promise of America?"
