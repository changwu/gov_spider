    Today, the Republic of Mali became the tenth country to sign a Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The President congratulates Malians for developing a results-oriented program focused on reducing poverty and creating a better life for its citizens. This agreement seeks to help Malians gain greater access to education, health services and markets through improvements in irrigation and the Bamako-SÃ©nou International Airport, a gateway for regional and international trade.
