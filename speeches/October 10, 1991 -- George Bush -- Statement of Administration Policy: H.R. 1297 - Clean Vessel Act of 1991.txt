    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 10/11/91)(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 22 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1297 because the bill would impose Federal restrictions on the expenditure of funds by States under the Sport Fish Restoration Program. Each coastal State should retain the responsibility to determine how its apportioned funds are used to protect coastal habitat.
