    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and two current beneficiary countries, Burma and the Central African Republic. The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
I intend to suspend indefinitely Burma and the Central African Republic from their status as GSP beneficiaries for failure to comply with section 502(b)(7) of that Act concerning internationally recognized worker rights. My decision will take place at least 60 days from the date of this letter.
Sincerely,
George Bush
