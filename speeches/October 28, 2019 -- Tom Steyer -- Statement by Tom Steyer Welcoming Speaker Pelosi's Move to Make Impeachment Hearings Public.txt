    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 28, 2019) â€” Today candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement following Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold a formal House vote on impeachment proceedings, declaring her intention to open up the process to the American public:
"Today's announcement by Speaker Pelosi is another significant step forward in restoring trust in our democracy. I launched Need to Impeach, a movement of over 8.3 million Americans, two years ago to hold Donald Trump accountable and to show that in this country, no one is above the law. I commend Speaker Pelosi and House leadership for their decision, and urge every member of Congress to vote their conscience and allow the American people to see the evidence for themselves. A public inquiry is the best and fairest way to shine a light on Donald Trump's crimes and corruption."
