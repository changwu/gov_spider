(House Rules)
(Rep. Camp, R-MI, and 14 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 6156, which would extend Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) treatment to the products of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Moldova.
In order for American businesses, workers, farmers and ranchers to reap the same economic benefits in Russia's markets that other WTO members receive, the Congress must end the applicability of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Russia and authorize the President to extend PNTR to Russia. H.R. 6156 is about providing opportunities for American businesses and workers and creating jobs here at home.
The Administration seeks to promote the rule of law and respect for human rights around the world and intends to continue working with the Congress to support those seeking a free and democratic future for Russia. The Administration supports Moldova's ongoing reform efforts and its aspirations for further integration into European institutions.
