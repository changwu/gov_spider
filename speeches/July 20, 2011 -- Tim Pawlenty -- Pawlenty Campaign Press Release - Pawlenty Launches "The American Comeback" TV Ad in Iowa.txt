TRANSCRIPT
Out here, you're tested.
You face an opponent experts say can't be beat.
You fight, you bleed, you prevail.
Our country's down but we're not out.
To come back, we need a leader with a proven record, not just rhetoric.
I took on the unions, and won.
I shut down a government, and won.
I moved a liberal state in a conservative direction.
Join me, and prove the experts wrong.
I'm Tim Pawlenty, and I approve this message.
