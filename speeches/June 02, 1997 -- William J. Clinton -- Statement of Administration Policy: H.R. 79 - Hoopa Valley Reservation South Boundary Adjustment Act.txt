    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Riggs (R) CA)
The Administration supports H.R. 79, which would transfer approximately 2,640 acres of land in the Six Rivers National Forest, California, to the Hoopa Valley Tribe to be held in trust by the United States and made part of the Hoopa Valley Reservation.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 79 would affect off-setting receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero.
