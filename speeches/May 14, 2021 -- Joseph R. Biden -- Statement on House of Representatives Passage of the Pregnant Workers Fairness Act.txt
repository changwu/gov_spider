    I applaud Chairman Nadler, Chairman Scott, and Ranking Member Kato for their leadership in passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a long overdue bipartisan effort to ensure equal protection in the workforce for women who are pregnant.
Across our country, too many pregnant workers are forced to choose between their health and a paycheck. They can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks, or forced to go on unpaid leave due solely to being pregnant. These practices are unfair and often dangerous. My administration has made it a priority to support the health and economic security of pregnant workers, particularly women of color, who experience unconscionably high rates of maternal mortality. It is long past time that all workplaces treat pregnant employees with dignity, respect, and fairness.
Today's bipartisan passage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in the House of Representatives marks a significant step forward on that front. I urge the Senate to act swiftly to pass this commonsense bill, and stand up for the health and economic security of pregnant workers and their families.
