    The Trump Administration is pleased that today, the United States House of Representatives acted on the President's request to provide critical relief from the recent natural disasters that have impacted millions of Americans living in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other affected areas. Moving forward, the Administration will continue to work with Congress to provide the resources necessary to recover and rebuild from the hurricanes and wildfires, and we urge Congress to adopt reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program to ensure the program's long-term financial viability.
