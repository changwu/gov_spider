    During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, Melania and I join all Americans in honoring the friends, family members, and loved ones we have lost to ovarian cancer. This month, we recommit ourselves to supporting every woman who bravely wages a battle of hope against this terrible disease.
The National Cancer Institute estimates that more than 22,000 Americans will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2017. Unfortunately, about 14,000 women in the United States will lose their battle with ovarian cancer this year alone. If diagnosed and treated early, however, the five-year survival rate for women fighting this disease is more than 90 percent. Regular medical checkups and learning about the early warning signs of ovarian cancer can save lives.
In addition to raising awareness, we reaffirm our pledge to prevent, treat, and defeat ovarian and other forms of cancer. Innovative and cutting-edge research in women's health can transform cancer detection and lead to new treatments that are less debilitating and even more effective. This is why my Administration will continue to clear the way for incredible breakthroughs in medical science, including by working with Congress to implement the 21st Century Cures Act. So far this year, the Food and Drug Administration has approved two maintenance therapies for ovarian cancer, to help women who are battling this disease lead longer, happier lives.
Melania joins me in sending our prayers to those affected by ovarian cancer, and we encourage every American to learn more about this important health issue. With the support of families and friends, healthcare providers, researchers, and advocates, we can create a healthier future for all Americans.
