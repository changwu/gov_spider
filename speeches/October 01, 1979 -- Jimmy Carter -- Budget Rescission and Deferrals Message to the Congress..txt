    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose rescission of $113,673 in unneeded funds appropriated to the International Communication Agency, and report 31 deferrals of fiscal year 1980 funds totalling $1,003.2 million. The deferrals are primarily routine in nature and do not, in most cases, affect program levels.
The details of the rescission proposal and each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
