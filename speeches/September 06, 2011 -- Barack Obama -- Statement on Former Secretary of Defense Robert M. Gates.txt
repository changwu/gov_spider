    I congratulate Robert Gates on his selection as the 24th chancellor of the College of William & Mary. In Bob, one of our Nation's oldest colleges has found one of our Nation's finest public servants. I'm confident that Bob will bring to this new role the same sense of duty and personal integrity that I and other Presidents valued during his distinguished career in Government. As he did at Texas A&M and the Department of Defense, Bob will again help lead an institution devoted to our Nation's most precious resource: our young men and women. I wish Bob the very best as he begins this new chapter at his alma mater, which helped to inspire his commitment to public service five decades ago.
