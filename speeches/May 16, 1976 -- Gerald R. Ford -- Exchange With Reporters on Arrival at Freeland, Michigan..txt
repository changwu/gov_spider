    IT IS great to be at the Tri-City Airport of Midland, Saginaw, and Bay City. We have had a great day and a half in Michigan. It's very encouraging, and we are very optimistic.
As I say on many occasions, I think the voters of Michigan will respond to what we have done. We have produced the peace. We have turned the economy around, and we have restored the faith and trust of the American people. Those are all strong and, I think, very sound assets for America in this very difficult time.
I will be glad to answer any questions.
REPORTER. How big do you think you might win by on Tuesday, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. I never make a point spread. I think we will do very, very well. I think the people of Michigan know what we have done under the most difficult circumstances, and we are counting on their support.
Q. Mr. President, can your campaign survive a loss in Michigan?
THE PRESIDENT. Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News], we aren't planning on it. So as long as it isn't planned on, doesn't take place, I really don't think it is a matter that we ought to be concerned about.
REPORTER. Okay, thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you all very, very much.
