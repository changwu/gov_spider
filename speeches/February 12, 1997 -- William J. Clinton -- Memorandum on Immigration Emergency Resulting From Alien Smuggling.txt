    Presidential Determination No. 97â€“16
Memorandum for the Attorney General
Subject: Immigration Emergency Resulting From Alien Smuggling
In September 1995, I determined that an immigration emergency was in existence with respect to the smuggling into the United States of illegal aliens. I therefore directed the use of up to $6,000,000 from the Immigration Emergency Fund to cover costs associated with repatriation of foreign nationals intercepted en route to the United States. To date, all but $700,000 of that amount has been used to cover these costs. While our policy to deter smuggling activity has been successful, attempts to smuggle illegal aliens persist and require continued efforts on the part of the United States.
Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 404(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, I hereby:

  Determine that the immigration emergency determined to exist in 1995 with respect to the smuggling into the United States of illegal aliens persists; and
Direct that up to $7,400,000 appropriated by the Congress to the Immigration Emergency Fund be used to cover costs associated with the repatriation of foreign nationals intercepted en route to the United States.

You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under this authority and to publish it in the Federal Register.
