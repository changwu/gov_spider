    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the first Annual Report of the Department of Education, as required by Section 426 of Public Law 96-88, the Department of Education Organization Act.
The Report outlines the progress of the Department during Fiscal Year 1980 in the attainment of its goals, priorities, and plans. It also emphasizes this Administration's efforts to provide more responsible and effective Federal support for education.
I believe that we have made substantial progress since the Department of Education opened its doors on May 4, 1980, in providing new leadership and support for American education.
JIMMY CARTER
