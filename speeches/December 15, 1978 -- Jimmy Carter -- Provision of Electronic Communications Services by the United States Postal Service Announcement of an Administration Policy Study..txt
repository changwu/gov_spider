    The President has directed Stuart Eizenstat, his assistant for domestic policy, to conduct a formal study to determine the administration's policy regarding the future role of the U.S. Postal Service in providing services by electronic communications. The study is directed toward developing a policy by early spring so that the administration will be prepared to respond definitively to the congressional committees which are expected to address this matter during the next session.
The following specific policy areas will be addressed:
—the possible future benefits to the Nation of Postal Service involvement in electronic message services and the potential costs to the Nation of establishing Postal Service competition in an industry that has previously been restricted to private competition;
—the impact of electronic communications on postal operations and revenues (both with and without USPS electronic services) and the overall economic impact, including potential reduction in postal costs, of a USPS investment in an electronic system; and
—the options for interconnection between the Postal Service physical delivery network and the electronic message industry.
An interagency coordinating committee, chaired by Eizenstat, met for the first time on December 13 to define the issues to be addressed to establish the administration's position. The Postal Service is represented on the committee and will assist in obtaining the necessary data and related considerations.
The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, under Henry Geller, will act as lead staff agency for the study. Other departments and agencies represented on the committee are: the Departments of the Treasury, Justice, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor; the Council of Economic Advisers; the Council on Wage and Price Stability; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Office of Management and Budget. In addition, the written views of labor, industry, and the general public will be solicited.
