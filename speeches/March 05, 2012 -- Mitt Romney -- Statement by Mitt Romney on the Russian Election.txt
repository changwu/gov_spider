    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the Russian election:
"What the world witnessed in Russia yesterday was a mockery of the democratic process. Instead of stating that it 'congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the Presidential elections,' as the Obama Administration has done, it should have condemned the flagrant manipulation and media restrictions that marred this election. With the dimming of democracy in Russia, a better label for President Obama's Russia policy is 'set back' rather than 'reset.'"
