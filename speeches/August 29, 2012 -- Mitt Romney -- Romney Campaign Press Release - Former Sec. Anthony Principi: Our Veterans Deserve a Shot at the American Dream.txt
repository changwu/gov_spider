    Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the American Legion:
"Mitt Romney understands that for our nation's veterans the fight doesn't end when they come home. Our returning vets have an unemployment rate that is significantly higher than that of the average American. We need a president who understands how to get the economy in gear so that it creates good jobs for everyone who seeks one, including our vets. After all our veterans have done for us, they deserve the dignity of pursuing the American Dream."
