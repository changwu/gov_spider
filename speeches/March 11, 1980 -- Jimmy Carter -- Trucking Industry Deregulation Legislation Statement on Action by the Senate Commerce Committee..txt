    The Senate Commerce Committee took a strong step in the fight against inflation today by reporting out a first-rate trucking regulatory reform bill. The committee's legislation will save consumers billions of dollars by opening the trucking industry to competition and by eliminating excessive restrictions and redtape. It will also save hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel by cutting away outdated restrictions on routing and backhauling.
I congratulate Chairman Howard Cannon, Senator Robert Packwood, and their colleagues on the committee for their bipartisan efforts on this bill. I urge the House and Senate to keep up the pace toward prompt passage of strong trucking reform legislation.
