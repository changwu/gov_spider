    Hillary and I, along with tens of millions around the world, were saddened to learn of the death of a man with rare insight and extraordinary spirit, Jacques Cousteau. While we mourn his death, it is far more appropriate that we celebrate his remarkable life and the gifts he gave to all of us.
Jacques Cousteau will be remembered for many things. He enabled mankind to truly become part of the sea and the creatures that live there, inventing scuba gear and creating the first one-person submarine. Most appropriately, he will be remembered for his service to us all on the good ship Calypso. Through his many documentaries, movies, and television specials, Captain Cousteau showed us both the importance of the world's oceans and the beauty that lies within. We are all far richer, and more caring, for his having shared his time on Earth with the human family.
One of his most important documentaries was titled "The World of Silence." Thanks to a life spent dedicated to serving all of God's creation, his legacy will be not silence. Rather, it will be continuing to inspire people the world over to love, appreciate, and respect the sea.
