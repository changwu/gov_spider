    THE PRESIDENT met this forenoon with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders to discuss matters concerning the defense and foreign policy of the United States.
The President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense made statements to the group concerning the gravity of the present international situation and the necessity for a very rapid increase in our military strength. The President indicated that a sharp step-up in our mobilization effort to support the increase in our military forces would be needed, and indicated that one of the things under consideration in this connection is the declaration of a national emergency.
The President called on each of the congressional leaders to make comments on these questions. There appeared to be unanimous agreement that our military strength should be built up with the utmost speed. There also appeared to be strong sentiment in favor of declaring a national emergency, although some of those present did not wish to state any views on this question without having an opportunity for further study as to its legal effects.
The President feels that all of those present at the conference approached the subjects under discussion in a constructive manner and that the discussion which took place will be most useful.
