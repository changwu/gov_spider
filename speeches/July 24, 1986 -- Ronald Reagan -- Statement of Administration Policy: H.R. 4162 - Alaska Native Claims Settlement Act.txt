    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Young (R) Alaska and Udall (D) Arizona)
The Administration cannot support H.R. 4162 because it contains fundamental policy flaws. It would expand upon the intended permanent settlement of Alaska Native Claims established in 1971, establish permanent racially-defined special economic and property rights, and could generate substantial litigation. The Administration will work in the Senate to have the necessary amendments made.
