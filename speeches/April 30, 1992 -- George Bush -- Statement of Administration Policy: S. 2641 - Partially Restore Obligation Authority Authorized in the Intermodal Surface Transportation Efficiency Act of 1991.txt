    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Moynihan (D) New York and 5 others)
The Administration supports enactment of S. 2641.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 2641 would have the effect of reducing outlays. It therefore is covered by the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 2641 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be detailed in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
