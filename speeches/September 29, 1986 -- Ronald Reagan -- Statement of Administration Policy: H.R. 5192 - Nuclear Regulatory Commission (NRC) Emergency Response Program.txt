    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Huckaby (D) Louisiana and 12 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5192. The bill establishes a federally-financed nuclear data link for communicating between NRC and nuclear licensees during nuclear incidents. This legislation is unwarranted in light of NRC's ongoing nuclear safety regulatory activities.
