    White House Underscores Progress through President Biden's Investing in America Agenda On First Day of Infrastructure Week and 18 Month Anniversary of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 18 months ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild our nation's infrastructure. While "Infrastructure Week" was a punchline under his predecessor, President Biden is delivering an "infrastructure decade" that is producing real results to connect communities, create good-paying jobs, and boost American manufacturing.
As part of the President's Investing in America agenda, the Administration has already announced over $220 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, including over 32,000 specific projects and awards, across over 4,500 communities in all 50 states, D.C., and territories.
Today, the White House released updated state by state fact sheets that highlight how across the country, the Biden-Harris Administration is rebuilding our roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, cleaning up legacy pollution, expanding access to affordable, high-speed internet, and ushering in a new era of clean energy.
In addition to announced funding to date, the fact sheets include key project highlights for all 50 states, D.C. and territories.
