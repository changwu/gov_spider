    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement on President Obama's visit to New Hampshire:
"I urge President Obama to suspend the never-ending campaign tactics and rhetoric on display in New Hampshire today. He needs to get back to Washington and work to cut taxes and spending and address our nation's fiscal crisis. Washington is broken. America needs Congress and the president to work through the holidays, work on weekends and do whatever it takes to cut spending and taxes and get America's economic house in order."
