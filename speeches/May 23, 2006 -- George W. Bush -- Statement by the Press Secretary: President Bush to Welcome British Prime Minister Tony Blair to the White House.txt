    President Bush will welcome British Prime Minister Tony Blair back to the White House on May 25, 2006. The President looks forward to continuing discussions with the Prime Minister on the full range of issues on our strategic agenda, including supporting the new Iraqi government, preventing Iran from acquiring the means to build nuclear weapons, bringing peace to the Middle East, ending the violence in Darfur, and promoting free trade. The United Kingdom is a key ally and a resolute partner of the United States in addressing these and other global challenges.
