    Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers today made the following statement on how President Obama's economic policies have failed women:
"For more than three years, President Obama's disastrous economic policies have wreaked havoc on women in the workplace with record levels of unemployment and the highest poverty rate in nearly two decades. Now the President has doubled down on his record of failure by proposing even more regulations and more taxes that will make it more difficult for women to find jobs. Mitt Romney supports pay equity for women and, as president, will do what President Obama has not â€” implement pro-growth economic policies that will allow women and all Americans to finally get back to work."
