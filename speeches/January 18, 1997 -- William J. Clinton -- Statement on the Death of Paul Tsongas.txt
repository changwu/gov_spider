    Paul Tsongas was a great American. He cared deeply about his beloved State of Massachusetts and about our country and its future. In a life devoted to public service, he set an unparalleled example of integrity, candor, and commitment. On behalf of the entire Nation, Hillary and I extend to his family our deepest sympathy and our profound gratitude for his life and work.
