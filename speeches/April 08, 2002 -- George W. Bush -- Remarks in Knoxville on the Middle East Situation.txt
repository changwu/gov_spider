    Let me say one thing before I leave. First of all, I meant what I said to the Prime Minister of Israel. I expect there to be withdrawal without delay. And I also meant what I said to the Arab world, that in order for there to be peace, nations must stand up, leaders must stand up and condemn terrorism, terrorist activity.
There is a mutual responsibility to achieve peace, and it's going to require leadership on both sides. And the United States is firmly committed to achieving peace and is firmly committedâ€”I am firmly committed to what I expect from both parties.
I repeat, I meant what I said about withdrawal without delay, and I mean what I say when I call upon the Arab world to strongly condemn and act against terrorist activity.
