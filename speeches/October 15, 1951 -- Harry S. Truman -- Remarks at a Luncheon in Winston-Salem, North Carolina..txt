    THANK YOU very much, Mr. Mayor. I shall treasure it all my life. It is very kind and thoughtful of your great city to think of making this presentation. I shall entrust it to the Secret Service to be sure that I get it home with me.
You remarked that General Washington was here in 1791, 160 years ago, and that he had come by stage coach. The most remarkable thing in our transportation system today is that I came from the capital of the United States in about an hour and a quarter. I imagine that George took at least 24 hours to come from Alexandria, Va., if that is where he started from.
And that is one of the situations that we have to meet. We have progressed so fast in things of that sort, transportation, and the know-how of other things, that we are not yet completely adjusted to them.
I hope we can make that adjustment, and I am sure that this institution we are setting up here today--or starting here today--will help us make that adjustment.
Thank you very much.
