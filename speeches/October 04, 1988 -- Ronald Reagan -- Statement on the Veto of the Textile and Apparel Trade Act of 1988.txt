    I am pleased that the House of Representatives sustained my veto of the protectionist textiles bill. With the defeat of this protectionist legislation, we remain committed to expanding the business, investment, and consumer opportunities for Americans. The decision of the House today continues the protrade progress we have made in this Congress with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act and the U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act. By sustaining the veto, the House has once again reaffirmed America's commitment to the free market and free international trade.
