    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that nearly 40 elected officials, First Responders, Republican community leaders and others in Michigan have publicly endorsed Mayor Rudy Giuliani for President.
The endorsements come as the presidential race begins in earnest in Michigan, and less than one week before a Republican presidential debate is held in Dearborn, MI.
"Rudy Giuliani has the right ideas for Michigan â€“ on the economy and taxes, on health care reform, on securing our borders and staying on offense in the Terrorists War on Us," said Congresswoman Candice Miller, who serves as Michigan state chair of Mayor Giuliani's campaign. "Michigan voters know that Rudy Giuliani will get the same real results as president that he did at the helm of one of the nation's largest governments, the City of New York."
