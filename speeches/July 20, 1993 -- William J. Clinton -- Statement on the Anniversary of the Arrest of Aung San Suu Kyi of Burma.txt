    Today, July 20, marks the 4th anniversary of the arrest and detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, the courageous Burmese opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The overwhelming mandate won by her party in the 1990 elections remains unfulfilled. This is a tragedy for Burma and a cause for outrage in the international community.
Despite her isolation, Aung San Suu Kyi is not forgotten. An authentic voice of Burmese democracy, she remains a symbol of hope to the people of her country who yearn for representative government and an inspiration to all who are striving for freedom and democracy elsewhere in Asia and throughout the world.
Today I renew my call to Burma's military rulers to release unconditionally Aung San Suu Kyi and all other prisoners of conscience, to respect the results of the 1990 elections, and to undertake genuine democratic reforms. History is on the side of freedom throughout the world, and I remain confident that the aspirations of all Burmese people for basic human rights and representative government will ultimately be fulfilled.
