    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Goodlatte, R-VA, and nine cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. This bill would ensure that American taxpayers are not subsidizing States and localities that work to affirmatively thwart Federal law enforcement efforts.
For States or localities determined to be in violation of Federal law, H.R. 3003 would restrict their eligibility to receive certain Department of Justice or Department of Homeland Security grants. Instead, under this bill, those grant funds would be reallocated to States and localities that comply with Federal law. Additionally, this bill would provide for more robust detention of criminal aliens. The Administration is committed to strengthening enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws in order to improve national security and public safety. This legislation is critical to these efforts.
If H.R. 3003 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
