 FLOTUS pool report #1 - Awaiting White House Christmas Tree arrival 
?Greetings from the North Portico driveway where we are awaiting the arrival of the White House Christmas Tree, which will be received by First Lady Melania Trump.
The tree is an 18 and 1/2 foot tall Fraser fir and is from Dan and Bryan Trees in West Virginia.
Owners of the farm - Dan and Anne Taylor - are here.
The tree goes in the Blue Room of the White House and its height is picked specifically to fit that room.
Ceremony starts at noon and is airing on White House live stream:

Down the drive, pool can see Winston and Ben - the two Clydesdales who are pulling the wagon with the tree.
Attached is an info sheet from the East Wing on the tree.

 FLOTUS pool report #2 - tree arrival 
?At 12:09 pm Winston and Ben trotted up the drive to deliver the White House Christmas Tree.
Melania Trump came out at 12:11 pm, wearing a black and white checked coat, black gloves and over the knee black high heeled boots.
She walked around the wagon to inspect the tree and waved to cameras. She spoke to the drivers and posed in front of the wagon for photos both solo and with the tree farm owners.
She did not answer a shouted question about how is the president. She did say "Merry Christmas."
At 12:14 pm she went back inside the White House.
A brass section of the United States Marine Band is here playing carols including Oh Christmas Tree and Hark the Herald Angles Sing.
It's windy, sunny and 58 degrees and that's a wrap from your White House Christmas Tree arrival.
