    Memorandum for A. Vernon Weaver
Subject: The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Membership on the Regulatory Council
When I established the Regulatory Council last year I directed that it be the focal point of efforts to assess the cumulative impact of regulation and to coordinate Federal regulatory activity. I hope that many of the improvements in government regulations that the Council is instituting will be of direct benefit to our nation's small businesses.
Government regulation sometimes poses special problems for small business. The Small Business Administration has done a great deal to make us aware of these problems and has worked closely with regulatory agencies to resolve them. This is an appropriate time to acknowledge formally the importance of the Small Business Administration's role in the Administration's regulatory reform effort by including SBA as a Council member.
I am pleased to grant your request for membership and I look forward to SBA's participation in the work of the Regulatory Council.
