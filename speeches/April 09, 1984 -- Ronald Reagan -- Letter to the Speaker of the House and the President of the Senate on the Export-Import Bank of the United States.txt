    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
This report is being submitted pursuant to Section 7(a) (2) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended. I have determined that the authority available to the Bank for fiscal year 1984 is sufficient to meet the needs of the Bank. This determination was based upon the transactions already approved, applications received by the Bank and estimates of the level of business likely for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
