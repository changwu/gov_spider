    By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization pursuant to the authority of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty ratified by the President on February 4, 1955, with the advice and consent of the Senate given on February 1, 1955 (6 UST 81, T.I.A.S. 3170), I hereby designate the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act.
The designation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as a public international organization within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which that organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or congressional action.
