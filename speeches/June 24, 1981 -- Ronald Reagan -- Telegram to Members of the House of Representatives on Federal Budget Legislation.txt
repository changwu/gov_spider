    Urgently request your support for Rule to permit single up-or-down vote on our bipartisan budget package to save additional $20 billion consistent with Gramm-Latta I. I consider this vote on the previous question vital to our Economic Recovery Program. Gag rule to deny House consideration of our entire package is unacceptable and denies American people opportunity to be heard on runaway Federal spending. Our previous efforts will be badly damaged unless we can stay together on this issue. Therefore, I seek your support to reconfirm your vote on the May 7 Budget Resolution.
