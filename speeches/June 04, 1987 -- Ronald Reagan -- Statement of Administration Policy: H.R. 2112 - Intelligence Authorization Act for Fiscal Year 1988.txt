    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Stokes (D) Ohio)
The administration supports House passage of H.R. 2112 but will seek to change the bill in conference to:

— Amend Title IV retirement benefits for certain former spouses of CIA employees to include the standards for retroactive, free benefits included in the Civil Service Retirement System.
— Delete Title VI on the Commission on Intelligence Personnel Systems because it is unnecessary. In addition the "hybrid" structure of the Commission is objectionable. Under Title VI, appointments to the Commission would be made by both the Executive branch (one member) and Legislative branch (two members). This conflicts with the Constitution's separation of powers requirements. Appointments to the Commission should be made exclusively by the Executive or Legislative branch.
In addition, the administration will seek in conference to restore certain program reductions to conform to the administration's request.
