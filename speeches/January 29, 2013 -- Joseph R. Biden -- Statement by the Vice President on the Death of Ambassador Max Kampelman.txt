    I was saddened to hear about the recent passing of Ambassador Max M. Kampelman. I was honored to have known this extraordinarily accomplished and decent man. For more than six decades, Democrats and Republicans alike relied on Max's advice and wisdom as he pursued a remarkable career in law, politics, and diplomacy. At the height of the Cold War, he championed and negotiated landmark agreements on human rights and nuclear arms reductions. Fittingly, Max devoted his final years to passionately advancing the vision he shared with Ronald Reagan and others â€“ that of a world without nuclear weapons. My thoughts and prayers are with Max's family.
