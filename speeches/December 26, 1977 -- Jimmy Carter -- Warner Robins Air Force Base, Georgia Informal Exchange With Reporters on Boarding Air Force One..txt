    THE PRESIDENT. I talked to Prime Minister Begin just before I left my home, about 10 minutes of 11.
Let me wait for Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International]. Helen, I wanted to wait for you. [Laughter]
I just told them that I talked to Prime Minister Begin just before I left home. He called me to give me a report. He says their visit to Ismailia was very successful, that he was pleased. They set up military and political committees to continue their work. And they'll meet for the first time January 15, one in Egypt and one in Jerusalem.
Q. Is Secretary Vance going to be joining the talks at all?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know yet.
Q. Have there been any discussions of that?
THE PRESIDENT. Prime Minister Begin said that they would like for Secretary Vance to join them, but I don't know if he will or not.
Q. There are some reports now that perhaps the meetings did not come out as well as was anticipated. Are you going to try to do anything to keep the momentum going?
THE PRESIDENT. We'll do all we can.
Q. Are you still optimistic?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, Prime Minister Begin was very pleased.
