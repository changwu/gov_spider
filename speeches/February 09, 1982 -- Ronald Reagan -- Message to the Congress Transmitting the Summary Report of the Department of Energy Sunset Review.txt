    To the Congress of the United States:
Transmitted herewith is the Summary Report of the Department of Energy Sunset Review. A Program-by-Program Analysis which provides detailed background information is being transmitted at the same time by the Secretary of Energy. These two volumes together satisfy the requirements of Title X of the Department of Energy Organization Act (P.L. 95-91).
I have asked Secretary Edwards and his staff to be available to respond to any questions or comments you may have regarding the Department of Energy Sunset Report.
