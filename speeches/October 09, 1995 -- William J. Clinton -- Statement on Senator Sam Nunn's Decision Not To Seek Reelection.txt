    For the last 23 years, Senator Nunn has served our country with tireless devotion and steady leadership. He has earned the respect and appreciation of all Americans for his leadership in national security, defense, and foreign policy. He has urged us to deal with the longterm challenges of our economy and to move beyond established political rhetoric to new policies that reward responsibility and work and to strengthen families and communities.
I am grateful for his wise counsel and personal friendship and look forward to his continued leadership in setting the new Democratic agenda and America's agenda in 1996 and beyond. I wish him and his fine family well.
