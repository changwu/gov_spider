    Today marks the eighth anniversary of the kidnapping of United States citizen Austin Tice, a journalist and veteran officer of the United States Marine Corps. Earlier this year, I asked the Government of Syria to work with us to find and return Austin. I am again calling on Syria to help us bring him home.
The United States, alongside partners in the Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, successfully destroyed ISIS' physical caliphate, and remains committed to mitigating the suffering of the Syrian people as the Syrian conflict enters its 10th year. As such, the United States continues to lead the globe in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.
There is no higher priority in my administration than the recovery and return of Americans missing abroad. The Tice family deserves answers. We stand with the Tice family and will not rest until we bring Austin home.
