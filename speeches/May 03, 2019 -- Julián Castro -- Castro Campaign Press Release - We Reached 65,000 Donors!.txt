    Thank you!
As of May 3rd, Julián Castro has secured 65,000 unique individual contributions, guaranteeing him for the first round of Democratic National Committee debates by both the polling and grassroots fundraising metrics.
Our campaign has reached the double threshold of polling and unique donors, and and we want to thank you for your support. We've received donations from all 50 states and have received at least 200 unique donors from more than 44 different states and territories!
"When I started this campaign on January 12, I knew our team would have to work harder with fewer resources," said Secretary Julián Castro. "Reaching this threshold of genuine grassroots support is encouraging and shows without a doubt that this campaign continues to become stronger and stronger. I'm grateful for the support of so many people from around the country and am looking forward to the debates in June and July."
That hard work is paying off. Our campaign is growing stronger every day. More and more people hear about our campaign and get on board. That's because of you, so let's keep up this momentum! 
See you at the debates!
