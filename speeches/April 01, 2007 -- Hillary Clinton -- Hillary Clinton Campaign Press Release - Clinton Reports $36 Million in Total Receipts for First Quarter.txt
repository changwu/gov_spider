    Total includes $26 million raised since Jan 20, $10 million transferred from successful senate reelection campaign
Hillary Clinton's campaign today announced it will report $36 million in total receipts for the first fundraising quarter, which ended March 31, 2007. The staggering number reflects the strength of support for Clinton from every walk of life and every part of America.
"We are overwhelmed by the tremendous enthusiasm and historic response this campaign has received so far," campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle said today. "Going forward we are poised to continue this success and make even more history."
Specifically, the campaign noted several key numbers demonstrating the overwhelming depth and breadth of Clinton's support:

$26 million raised in new receipts since launching her campaign on January 20
80 percent of the contributions were $100 or less.
$4.2 million raised on the internet (including $1 million in a week during the One Week, One Million campaign, and nearly $600,000 online in the 36 hours preceding the deadline)
$6 million in total grassroots donations (internet plus direct mail and telemarketing receipts)
50,000 donors (tens of thousands of them new donors)
Contributions received from residents of all 50 states (plus Washington, DC)
$10 million transferred from Senator Clinton's successful senate reelection account

In March of 2003, the highest total reported by a Democratic campaign in its first-quarter fundraising report was $7.4 million and the top four candidates combined raised just over $23 million. In March of 1999, incumbent Vice President Al Gore reported $8.9 million for his first quarter.
