    Jack Anderson's latest column alleging that the United States plans to attack Iran and that Soviet leaders believe in the seriousness of such plans is as false, grotesque, and irresponsible as were his columns a month ago on the same subject. The latest charges are complete inventions which can only damage efforts to obtain the prompt and safe release of the American hostages in Iran and the prospects for peace in that region. What is true, however, is that Soviet propaganda has exploited Anderson's similar false allegations to inspire anti-American sentiments in Iran and elsewhere, to prolong the hostage crisis, and to construct pretexts for aggressive Soviet actions.
