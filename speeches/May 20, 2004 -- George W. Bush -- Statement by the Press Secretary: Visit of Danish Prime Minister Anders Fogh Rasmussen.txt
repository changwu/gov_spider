    President Bush will host Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen for a meeting and lunch at the White House on May 28, 2004. Denmark is a close NATO ally of the United States, a key contributor to the international effort to bring peace and democracy to Iraq, and a strong proponent of close transatlantic relations. The President looks forward to discussions with Prime Minister Rasmussen on the war on terrorism, Iraq, and nonproliferation, as well as efforts to achieve a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and support to calls for democracy and reform throughout the broader Middle East region.
