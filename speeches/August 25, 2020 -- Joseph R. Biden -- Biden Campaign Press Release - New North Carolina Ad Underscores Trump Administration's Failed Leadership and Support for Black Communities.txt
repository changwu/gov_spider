    Today, Biden for President released a new ad in North Carolina to highlight the Trump administration's failures in uplifting, supporting and empowering Black communities across the United States.
The 30-second ad, "Failure," features North Carolina State Representative James A. Gailliard, who has served as senior pastor of Word Tabernacle Church in Rocky Mount, North Carolina for the past 15 years. Rep. Gailliard points to President Trump's botched COVID-19 and public health, and ineffective approaches to building a stable middle class as reasons for Americans to support Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris and change the nation's trajectory.

Additionally, two national digital ads geared towards African American voters will begin airing on television in North Carolina and demonstrate how Joe Biden's Build Back Better plans for working families will support small businesses and expand educational opportunities. "EcoPower" outlines how Biden's plan will build a future of wealth and ambition for African American small businesses and "Preschool" notes how a Biden Administration will ensure all children have access to free, high-quality preschool.
The ads premiere on local cable, radio, and digital channels this week across North Carolina as a direct counter to the Republican National Convention. It is part of the Biden for President's ongoing national paid media program across television, radio, and digital, with $26 million in spend this week.
