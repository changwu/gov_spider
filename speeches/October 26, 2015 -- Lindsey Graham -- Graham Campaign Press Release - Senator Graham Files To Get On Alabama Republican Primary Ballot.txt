    Alexandria, VA â€” Ahead of the November 6th deadline, Lindsey Graham 2016 today filed more than 1,000 signatures of qualified voters (double the minimum) and submitted the qualifying fee to the Alabama Republican Party to gain access to the Alabama Republican primary ballot.
"We want to thank all of our volunteers and staff for their hard work in getting Senator Graham on the ballot in Alabama," said Nick Connors, Director of Ballot Access and Delegates for the Graham Campaign. "Senator Graham is the only candidate in this race ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one, and we are confident that Alabamians, and people throughout the so-called SEC Primary states, will respond favorably to his common sense conservatism and strong national security message."
Lindsey Graham 2016 has met every ballot access deadline to date.
