Script For "Cuts" (Radio :60)
SENATOR JOHN WARNER: Hello, this is Senator John Warner.
Hampton Roads is home to the world's largest military facilities.
Barack Obama's liberal colleagues in Congress announced they will cut defense spending by 25%.
Fellow Virginians: cuts in the defense budget will weaken Virginia's economy and weaken national defense.
John McCain is a true fighter. He'll champion Tidewater's leading role in our nation's defense.
ANNCR: Newspapers document Congressional liberals have announced a plan to cut defense spending by 25% after the election.
It would mean huge job losses right here in Tidewater.
Independent studies prove it will mean fewer jobs. Fewer benefits for more communities in the middle of a recession.
That's the Congressional liberals' plan if you give them your vote.
Paid for by McCain-Palin 2008 and the Republican National Committee.
JOHN MCCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approve this message.
