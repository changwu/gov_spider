    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Rep. Graham (R) SC and 95 cosponsors)
The Administration supports protection for unborn children and therefore supports House passage of H.R. 503. The legislation would make it a separate Federal offense to cause death or bodily injury to a child, who is in utero, in the course of committing any one of 68 Federal offenses. The bill also would make substantially identical amendments to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Administration would strongly oppose any amendment to H.R. 503, such as a so-called "One-Victim" Substitute, which would define the bill's crimes as having only one victim - the pregnant woman.
