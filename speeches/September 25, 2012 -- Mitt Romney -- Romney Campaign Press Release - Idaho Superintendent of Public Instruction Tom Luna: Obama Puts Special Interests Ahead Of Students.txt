    Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan to reform education:Â 
"If we want to keep the American Dream alive and give young people the opportunities they deserve, it is essential that we bring our schools up to the demands of the 21st century economy. President Obama's four years in the White House have demonstrated that we cannot improve our schools until we have a president who is willing to put students before special interests. We need reforms that will offer parents greater and better quality choices for their children, hold schools accountable, and attract and retain the best teachers. Mitt Romney's record shows he understands these facts, and that's why we need his leadership in the White House."
