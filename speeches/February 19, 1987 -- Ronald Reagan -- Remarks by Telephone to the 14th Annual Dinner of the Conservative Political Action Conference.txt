    Mr. Keene. It's my understanding that the President of the United States is on the line and that he will have a chance to say a few words to you. Mr. President?
The President. Thank you very much. And good evening to all my friends there and all you loyal conservatives that are gathered there at dinner this evening. I know now that you're about to hear from the Attorney General. I discovered where he was when I tried to get him on the phone. I wanted to ask him where I could find a cheap lawyer. But I'm glad he's there. It's all in fun, Ed.
I look forward to being there personally tomorrow, joining you for the largest of CPAC's 14 conferences involving 50 groups representing some 3 million Americans. Well, I'll spend some time tomorrow outlining goals for the future. But for tonight, if you are listening, let me deliver to you my deep and lasting thanks for what you believe and for what you've done in the name of those beliefs. And we'll talk tomorrow, and it won't be by phone.
Now, enjoy the assembled stars of Broadway and the talents of my friend Yakov Smirnoff. I hope you hear this partâ€”I know you'll all join me in congratulating him on acquiring his United States citizenship this year. [Applause] Now, I know you heard that. So, Yakov, welcome aboard! We're glad to have you be one of us. So, until tomorrow then, God bless you all, and good night.
Mr. Keene. Mr. President, thank you, and we look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
The President. Okay. Good night. Thanks.
