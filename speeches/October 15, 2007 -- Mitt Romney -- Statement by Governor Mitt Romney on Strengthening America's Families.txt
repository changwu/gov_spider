Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding the appearance by Bill Cosby and Dr. Alvin Poussaint on NBC's "Meet the Press" with Tim Russert:
"On yesterday's 'Meet the Press,' Bill Cosby, Dr. Alvin Poussaint and Tim Russert brought much-needed attention to an issue of national importance – the crisis afflicting families and, as they specifically noted, families in African-American communities. Our nation prospers when children are raised in strong families. Bill Cosby, Dr. Poussaint and Tim Russert are to be commended for bringing the national spotlight to the importance of having strong families with a mother and a father. America's inner strength, the strength of our families and communities, is just as important as our economic strength and military strength. Strong families form our heart and our culture and that's what makes America special. Some of the most important work being done in our country today is the work going on within the four walls of the American home."
