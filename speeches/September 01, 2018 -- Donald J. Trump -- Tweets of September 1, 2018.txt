.@Rasmussen_Poll just came out at 48% approval rate despite the constant and intense Fake News. Higher than Election Day and higher than President Obama. Rasmussen was one of the most accurate Election Day polls!Retweets: 20400Favorites: 84744

The ABC/Washington Post Poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 Election. I call it a suppression poll - but by Election Day they brought us out of shame to about even. They will never learn!Retweets: 14825Favorites: 66829

Report: There were no FISA hearings held over Spy documents.'It is astonishing that the FISA courts couldn't hold hearings on Spy Warrants targeting Donald Trump. It isn't about Carter Page it's about the Trump Campaign. You've got corruption at the DOJ & FBI. The leadership....Retweets: 19901Favorites: 72506

'You have a Fake Dossier gathered by Steele paid by the Clinton team to get information on Trump. The Dossier is Fake nothing in it has been verified. It then filters into our American court system in order to spy on Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton's political opponent......Retweets: 22652Favorites: 82755

There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decade of abuse Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere with these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off..Retweets: 916Favorites: 2954

....Remember NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made. The U.S. lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. We were far better off before NAFTA - should never have been signed. Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for. We make new deal or go back to pre-NAFTA!Retweets: 19907Favorites: 81782
