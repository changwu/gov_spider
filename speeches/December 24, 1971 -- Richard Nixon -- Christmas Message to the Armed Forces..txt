    AS WE move into this season consecrated to the ideals of human brotherhood, for the first time in many years this Nation can see a day when those ideals may become a reality. We see before us a generation of peace for America.
Because we have seen the potentialities of war, we know the necessity of peace. But at this time of the year, we are especially conscious that peace is more than a practical necessity--it is a spiritual imperative.
We are equally conscious that the price of peace--like the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. In the long journey toward peace, our men and women in uniform have kept the vigil. It is you who have recognized that peace without freedom is not acceptable, and that freedom without strength is not possible. It is because of your devotion, your courage, and your sacrifices that we now come to this season of light with the firm belief that the light will not fade again and that there may be at last peace on earth, good will towards men for our time and for all time.
Mrs. Nixon and I join with a grateful Nation in wishing you the warmest blessings of this Christmas season.
