    "During his time in office, President Obama has repeatedly shown how out of touch he is with the realities of our economy. Two years ago today, he kicked off a 'Recovery Summer' campaign that never arrived. Now, he claims the private sector is 'doing fine.' Time and again, President Obama has shown an extraordinary misunderstanding of how our economy works. From day one of his presidency, Mitt Romney will deliver pro-growth policies that will get our country back on track and get Americans back to work." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
