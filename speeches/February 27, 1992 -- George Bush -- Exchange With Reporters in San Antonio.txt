    North American Free Trade Agreement
Q. Mr. President, did you make any breakthroughs on free trade this morning?
The President. No. We had good discussions on that with the President of Mexico. And we just reassured him that we want an agreement, a good agreement as soon as possible. No politics, no nothing is going to stand in the way of our doing what is right and what is best for the American people. And what's best is to get a fair trade -- free trade agreement through as soon as possible.
Q. Do you think there will be one this year, Mr. President?
The President. Well, we're hoping so, yes.
