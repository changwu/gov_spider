HOUSTON, Texas — Below are ten falsehoods in less than four minutes that Sen. Marco Rubio made against Ted Cruz during an interview with Fox's America's Newsroom this morning. Cruz has led the fight to restore a strong foreign policy and to keep Americans safe and free.

The budget spends more on military each year.
4. "With an Air Force that would not have the bombs necessary to carry out what he's talking about": FALSE
