    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the Transportation Communications Union. TCU has 65,000 active and retired members, mostly employed in the railroad industry.
"The best candidate for our members and all of labor is Hillary Clinton," said TCU President Bob Scardelletti. "She gives American workers the best opportunity to have a friend in the White House and a strong advocate for their issues. "
TCU is an affiliate of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which has also endorsed Hillary.
"I am honored to receive the support of the Transportation Communications Union," Clinton said. "America's working families will not be invisible to my administration."
The IAM and its more than 700,000 members and the United Transportation Union and its 125,000 members endorsed Clinton last week.
