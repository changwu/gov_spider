    In response to Donald Trump's comments on health care and COVID-19 at tonight's ABC Town Hall, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Donald Trump has lied to the American people throughout his presidency, and tonight he lied to a woman whose very life is threatened by his relentless assault on our health care. Even in the middle of a pandemic that his mismanagement continues to badly worsen, Trump is trying to dismantle Obamacare -- and in the process strip away protections from more than one hundred million Americans who are living with pre-existing conditions.
"What's more, after almost 200,000 Americans lost their lives because of his failed response to COVID-19, Trump again suggested tonight that the virus would just "go away." The American people are crying out for real leadership on this pandemic, but Trump just confirmed tonight, yet again, that even after 8 months of letting the worst public health crisis in 100 years spiral out of control that not only does he not have a plan -- he doesn't have a clue.
"Now, more than ever, we need a President who will fight to make health care more accessible, and more affordable, for the middle class families who are struggling because of Trump's failed leadership. Joe Biden fought to expand health care access to more than 20 million Americans, and as President will finally bring the pandemic under control and build our economy back better."
