Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the court decision striking down Iowa's Defense of Marriage Act:
"The ruling in Iowa today is another example of an activist court and unelected judges trying to redefine marriage and disregard the will of the people as expressed through Iowa's Defense of Marriage Act. This once again highlights the need for a Federal Marriage Amendment to protect the traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman."
