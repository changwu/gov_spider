    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom to discuss North Korea's claimed September 3 test of a hydrogen bomb. They agreed that this latest reckless act only strengthens the world's determination to confront the growing North Korean threat. President Trump reiterated that now is not the time to talk to North Korea, and made clear that all options remain open to defend the United States and its allies against North Korean aggression. The two leaders resolved to continue working closely together on increasing diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea, and to call on others to do the same.
