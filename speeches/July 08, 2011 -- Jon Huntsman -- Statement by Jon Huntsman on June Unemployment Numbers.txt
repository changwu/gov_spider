Today's jobs report revealed yet another month of anemic job creation and rising unemployment. The American people expect and deserve better.
We need new leadership and pro-growth policies to unleash a wave of job creation. Below is Gov. Huntsman's statement from this morning:
"Rising unemployment rates and extremely anemic job creation are not acceptable. Even in great hardship, the American people have been extraordinarily patient in waiting for the better and brighter times promised to them by this Administration. Their patience has rightly worn thin. We need free-market, pro-growth policies to spark a wave of job growth - the same policies we implemented in Utah to make it the fastest-growing state in the nation. America needs new leadership to turn our country around."
