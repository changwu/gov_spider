VP Pool Report #1 - COVID-19 booster 
Good morning everyone,
the rain finally stopped, it's nice and sunny here at the White House. I'll be your pooler for the VP's booster shot. The Vice President is scheduled to receive her booster of the Moderna vaccine at 11:25am in the South Court. There is no other event on today's schedule.
Background from a WH Official

The Vice President received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on December 29, 2020 and the second dose on January 26, 2021.
The Vice President is required to travel frequently and interact with many individuals in the course of conducting her official duties; she is considered at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure due to her occupation and meets criteria for receiving a booster shot.
