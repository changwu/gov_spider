"I live in New York City. There is a tremendous movement on to have and allow gay marriage."
"Hey, I lived in New York City and Manhattan all my life so my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa, perhaps, but [gays openly serving in the military] is not something that would disturb me."
"I'm very pro choice. And again it may be a little bit of a New York background because there is some different having attitude in different parts of the country and you know I was raised in New York, grew up and work and everything else in New York City."
But you would not ban partial-birth abortion?
