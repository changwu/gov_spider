HOUSTON, Texas â€” Conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt recently discussed the current state of the race for the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States where he observed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is "the front runner."


Excerpts appear below:
"I think that Ted Cruz, if he's the nominee, I advise [Hillary Clinton] don't get in the debate stage. Simply reject debates, he'll kill you, he'll take you by joint and arm.
"...Right now he's actually, I think, poised, given the rules set, is the front runner ... it starts very, very soon, because it's Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, with Nevada thrown in, and Nevada's going to be a Rand Paul win.
"...I actually thinks he's prepared better to run the board than anybody else. I know conventional wisdom says Jeb's got the money and Marco Rubio's lighting up the crowds, and he does. If you look at the social media engagement, if no other measure, Ted Cruz has got the deepest level of social media engagement."
