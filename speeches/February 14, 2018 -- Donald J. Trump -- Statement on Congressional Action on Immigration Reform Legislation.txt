    I want to thank Chairman Grassley for introducing legislation based on the White House immigration reform and border security framework. The Grassley bill accomplishes the four pillars of the White House Framework: a lasting solution on DACA, ending chain migration, cancelling the visa lottery, and securing the border through building the wall and closing legal loopholes. I am asking all Senators, in both parties, to support the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill these four pillarsâ€”that includes opposing any short-term, bandaid approach. The overwhelming majority of American voters support a plan that fulfills the framework's four pillars, which move us towards the safe, modern, and lawful immigration system our people deserve.
At the same time, I remain encouraged by developments in the House toward advancing legislation from Chairmen Goodlatte and McCaul that also enshrines our four pillars.
Now that our military is fully funded and will be rebuilt stronger than ever before, my focus is on enacting responsible and commonsense immigration reform that delivers for the American people.
