    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement on Senator Clinton's announcement that she has introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour:
"I am glad Senator Clinton has joined me in supporting a further increase in the minimum wage. Over five months ago, I challenged all of the candidates to help hard-working families and join my effort to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour, and now, just 14 days before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Clinton has answered my call.
"But changing America demands all of us do even more. In this spirit, I hope she will join me in rejecting the money of Washington lobbyists that is corrupting our system and hurting middle-class families."
