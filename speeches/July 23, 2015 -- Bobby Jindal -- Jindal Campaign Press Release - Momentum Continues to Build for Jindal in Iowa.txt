    Over the past several weeks, Governor Jindal has hit the ground running in Iowa, launching a 99 county tour that has not only granted extensive exposure for the Governor but has produced a plethora of positive earned media.
A poll fielded from July 19th through July 21st among 600 Iowa Republican Caucus attendees show the extent to which Governor Jindal's ramped up efforts in Iowa are not only boosting his image ratings but are directly translating to the ballot.
While the image ratings of other Republican hopefuls have stagnated or retreated, Governor Jindal continues to grow his positives and currently sits at an impressive 70-10 favorable rating among Iowa GOP Caucus participants.
More often than not, ballot follows image which is exactly what we see on the ballot test as Jindal finds himself in 4th place overall at 8%
