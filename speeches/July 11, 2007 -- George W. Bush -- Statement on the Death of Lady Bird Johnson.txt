    Laura and I mourn the passing of our good friend and a warm and gracious woman, Lady Bird Johnson. Those who were blessed to know her remember Mrs. Johnson's lively and charming personality, and our Nation will always remember her with affection. Mrs. Johnson became First Lady on a fateful day in November 1963 and was a steady, gentle presence for a mourning nation in the days that followed.
In the White House, Mrs. Johnson shared her love of the environment and nature with our entire country. The native wildflowers that bloom along roadsides today are part of her lasting legacy. She joined President Johnson in the struggle for civil rights, inspiring millions of Americans. Her commitment to early education gave many children a head start in life.
President Johnson once called her a woman of "ideals, principles, intelligence, and refinement." She remained so throughout their life together and in the many years given to her afterward. She was much-loved in our home State of Texas, and the Bush family is fortunate to have known her.
Lady Bird Johnson leaves behind her devoted daughters, Lynda and Luci, their fine families, and a nation that joins them in honoring a good life of kindness and service.
