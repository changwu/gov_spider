    Today retired Naval Intelligence Officer and Emmy-award winning TV personality Montel Williams endorsed Governor John Kasich for president.
Said Williams, "Now more than ever, Americans need a leader with the vision and experience to unite the country and lead with a steady hand. In a sea of negativity and bluster, John Kasich is a much-needed dose of sanity. There's simply no other GOP candidate in the race with the wide appeal to bring people together.
As a veteran, it's clear to me that he is the most well-suited candidate to serve as Commander-in-Chief."
Montel Williams earned worldwide recognition as the host of the long-running Montel Williams Show and as a prominent advocate for the military and veterans who led an aggressive campaign to institute drastic reform at the VA. A graduate of the Naval Academy, Williams served in both the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy for 22 years before being honorably discharged.
Said Kasich, "People know Montel Williams as a gifted entertainer, but not as many know that he spent several decades serving his country in the armed forces, or that he is a tireless advocate for veterans and people with debilitating illness. We may not agree on every issue, but we share a common vision for a stronger, more unified America. I am truly grateful for his support."
