    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2417, and will work in the Senate to delete, effective October 1, 1987, the "dual choice" provision, section 1310 of the Public Health Service Act, requiring employers to offer the option of HMO membership as part of their employee health benefit plans. Since HMOs are now sufficiently attractive that employers willingly offer them, this provision is unnecessary and overly prescriptive.
