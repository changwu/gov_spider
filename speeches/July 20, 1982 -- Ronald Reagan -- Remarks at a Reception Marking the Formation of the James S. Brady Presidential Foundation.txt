    The President. Well, of course we all know why we're here. And I think it's wonderful that so many of you would join in what is a most, I think, wonderful and worthy endeavor, the idea being to start a foundation. It'll be named the Brady Foundation in honor of Jim Brady. And, of course, the purpose is to have a permanent foundation for individuals who have happen to them what happened to Jim in attempts of the same kind, from the past and for the future.
Jim Lynn is going to serve as president of the Brady Foundation. Joe Rodgers and Bob Strauss are going to be the Foundation's cochairmen.
You know, I don't know how many of you at the Old Timer's Baseball Game last night noticed—I think all of us here have a love for Jim Brady, and he certainly proved he has high connections. He was out at the ball game—and I don't think you even knew that—and it was raining. And he was introduced, and it stopped raining. [Laughter]
So, there is much more to be said for it than that. This thing—and we—I think all of us are going to do everything we can to see that it succeeds and that it does become permanently established and able to make provision for those who paid a price and who need its help.
I couldn't say anything to any of you about the man we honor, Jim Brady, that you don't already know. And so—have you got anything to say?
Mrs. Reagan. Oh! [Laughter] Oh, dear.
The President. Well, you said you wanted the youngest and most handsome— [laughter] —
Mrs. Reagan. My Y and R.
The President. Well, I'm not going to keep you here. I think the purpose is a little entertainment and—
Mrs. Reagan. Y and H, not Y and R.
The President. Yes, Y and H.
Mrs. Reagan. Y and H.
The President. Yes.
Mrs. Reagan. Young and handsome.
The President. All right. Well, thank you again, all of you, for being here.
