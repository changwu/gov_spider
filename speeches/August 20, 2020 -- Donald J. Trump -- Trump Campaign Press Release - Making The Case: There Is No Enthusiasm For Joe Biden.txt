    Throughout the past three nights of the lifeless Democratic National Convention, the Democrat Party confirmed what we already knew - there is no enthusiasm for Joe Biden. While hypocritical, out-of-touch politicians try to paint a doom and gloom image of America, President Trump knows we are the greatest nation in the world and puts our country first each and every day. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would usher socialism into our country with open arms, making it clear that President Donald J. Trump is only choice this November.
Donald Trump Jr. discussed all this and more on tonight's 'Making The Case,' hosted by National Chair of Trump Victory Finance Committee Kimberly Guilfoyle.

"The Democrat Party has spent their entire convention shaming Americans for wanting to achieve greatness and pushing lectures from out-of-touch, failed Washington bureaucrats," said Kimberly Guilfoyle, National Chair for Trump Victory Finance Committee. "Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the most radical ticket in modern American history, and Americans will not rally around their socialist agenda. The enthusiasm for President Donald J. Trump is growing stronger by the day and we must fight to re-elect him this November."
"There is a reason that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can't muster any enthusiasm for their ticket, even in their own party - they are spineless, career politicians that have been failing the American people for decades," said Donald Trump Jr. "While President Trump uplifts our great nation and leads us forward, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to fundamentally change America with their radical, socialist agenda."
