Travel pool #3 — Camp David 
Motorcade arrived at Camp David and broke from pool vans at 7:47 pm after a 40-minute ride.
Pool vans sat on a secluded road as president's SUV and other vehicles turned up another road.
Pool held in vans in wooded area before starting trip back to D.C.
Earlier, the motorcade traveled through a small business area near the airport and a man filmed it with his phone and waved vigorously outside the Break Away II Sports Lounge.
Law enforcement blocked off a few intersections as lines of cars waited for the motorcade to go through.
From there, it was mostly a slow roll through rural towns on state routes 60, 418 and 64 with the red and blue lights blinking against the darkness.
A sign in front of one small house-like structure advertised "dinner rolls" and "cut lettuce."
On windy roads closer to Camp David, a Smoky the Bear sign said the fire danger was "Low" today.
