    I have signed an Executive order to implement the portion of my Executive Office reorganization plan that abolishes the Office of Telecommunications Policy. While reducing the size of the Executive Office, this reorganization will enhance the administration's ability to exercise leadership in communications policy.
Advances in communications are having a tremendous effect on the way people live. Developments in computers, satellites, electronic funds transfers, electronic mail, mobile radios, and cable TV will change many aspects of .our daily lives. These changes pose important choices for our country.
The Office of Telecommunications Policy was never equipped to play a strong role in this debate. Now, for the first time, communications policy will be handled at the Cabinet level.
The Commerce Department will take the lead in conducting research, developing policy proposals, and representing the administration before Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. Commerce will also assign frequencies for the Federal Government's radio stations.
Some functions have been kept in the Executive Office because they could not be performed effectively in a line agency. The Office of Management and Budget will set policy for procurement and management of the Government's telecommunications systems and will decide appeals from Commerce's frequency assignments. The National Security Council and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will handle certain national security and emergency preparedness policy functions. The Domestic Policy Staff will keep me informed on communications developments.
I am pleased to have nominated a talented expert, Henry Geller, to handle Commerce's responsibilities. He will hold the new position of Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information.
