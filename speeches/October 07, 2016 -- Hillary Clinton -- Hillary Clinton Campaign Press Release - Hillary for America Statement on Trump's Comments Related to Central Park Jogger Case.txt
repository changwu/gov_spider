    After Donald Trump doubled down his view that the five men convicted and later exonerated on DNA evidence in the Central Park Jogger case are still guilty, Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Maya Harris released the following statement:
"The facts here are clear: These men were exonerated. Another man has admitted to committing the crime, as proven by DNA evidence. Trump rushed to judgment on the case, has refused to admit he is wrong and continues to peddle yet another racist lie, a pattern for him and a clear reason why he is unfit to be president."
