    In recent weeks, government affiliated armed groups and independent "self-defense" militias in the Central African Republic have committed shocking and horrific atrocities against innocent civilians that demand a swift response by the international community.
Today's passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 is an important step in preventing further atrocities or an escalation of the violence. It provides African Union-led peacekeepers (MISCA) and French forces a Chapter VII mandate to protect civilians, restore security, and ensure humanitarian access. It also calls for contingency planning in the event the Council decides in the future that it is appropriate to consider the deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation.
In support of these efforts, the United States is providing $40 million in assistance to the African Union security mission, and we continue to evaluate what more we can do to help stabilize the situation and support a political transition. We join the international community in condemning the violence that has taken place, in demanding accountability for the perpetrators, and in calling on all parties to work toward a restoration of democracy.
