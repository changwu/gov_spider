    On December 1, World AIDS Day, there will be a commemoration in Washington to remember all those with HIV infection and all who have died from it. The end result of this infection, AIDS, has been diagnosed in over 112,000 people in this country as of October 1989, and 65,000 people have died since the beginning of the epidemic. Though the problem is great and taxing our health care system now, far greater difficulties await us in terms of human suffering and provision of health care.
We have committed resources at an unprecedented rate to HIV-related research of all kinds. Though there is no cure for AIDS at present, we will continue the most vigorous research efforts. At the same time, we must also educate and prevent. The disease is spread through known ways, and it is clear that education on the facts is our best means of combating AIDS at this time.
Finally, we must remember those Americans who have become infected with the virus, including some who may be unaware of their infection. These people need our help and our compassion. Our hearts go out to those afflicted, as our heads work towards finding solutions. In the meantime, we must continue to educate those around us regarding the prevention of this terrible disease.
