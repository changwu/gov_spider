    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 3 of Public Law 94-90, I am forwarding to the Congress a Report on the Investigation and Study of the War Risk Insurance Program of the Department of Transportation.
This Report states that the existing authority of the Secretary of Transportation under Title XIII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 should be expanded in certain respects. This Report will provide the basis for developing remedial legislation. Such legislation should authorize the Secretary of Transportation, after appropriate consultations with other Federal agencies and with the approval of the President, to provide insurance for international U.S. commercial aviation when such insurance is not available commercially and when it is necessary for the continuation of a particular required air service.
I transmit this Report for consideration by the Congress. The Department of Transportation will soon be transmitting implementing legislation.
