    Dole/Kemp '96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today on the new report on teenagers and drug use:
"Today we got yet another report from the field showing the terrible casualty count from Bill Clinton's failure to wage a real war on drugs. According to a report released by Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, nearly 70 percent of students say drugs are being kept, used or sold at their schools.. And just as drug use has doubled under Bill Clinton, so has the percent of students who my they plan to use drugs in the future -- up from 11 percent to 22 percent - a tragic and preventable increase.
"The blame for this massive increase in teen drug use falls solidly on Bill Clinton's doorstep. Yesterday's Washington Post documented how the Clinton administration's policies have caused a huge increase in illegal drugs entering the U.S. through Mexico.
"The students in the survey ranked drug use as the biggest problem facing young people today. If only Bill Clinton would make teen drug abuse as high a priority as today's teenagers do."
