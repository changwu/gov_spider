    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to learn that it has received the vote of the Governor of Alabama, Robert Bentley. On the nationally syndicated radio show, "Rick and Bubba Show," Alabama Congressman Robert Aderholt made the following announcement:
Congressman Aderholt said: "He and his wife will be voting for Rick Santorum for President. I was very excited to hear our Governor felt his values were in line with Rick Santorum... He has told people that he is voting for Senator Santorum and he holds the values and principles he believes in."
Rick Santorum said: "I am honored to have Governor Bentley's support. Governor Bentley is a true public servant who goes to work each day fighting for Alabama and her people. He understands what small business owners and entrepreneurs are facing, and he has applied those principles day-in and day-out. That is the mindset we need in Washington, one that doesn't represent 1%, 95%, or 99% of Americans - but all Americans. I am committed to doing just that, representing all Americans and with support of great Americans like Governor Bentley, I am confident we have taken one more big step toward realizing that opportunity."
Governor Robert Bentley was elected to the governorship in 2010 promising to "put Alabamians back to work" and committed that he would not accept a salary as Governor until Alabama reaches full employment. Governor Bentley previously served two-terms in the Alabama House of Representatives and was a small business owner, founding the Alabama Dermatology Associates - which grew to be one of the largest dermatology practices in the southeast. Governor Bentley currently chairs the Appalachian Regional Commission and is a member of the Economic Development and Commerce Commission with the National Governors Association.
