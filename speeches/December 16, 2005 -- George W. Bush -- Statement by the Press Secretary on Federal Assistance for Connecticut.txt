    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Connecticut and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding from October 14-15, 2005.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of Litchfield, New London, Tolland, and Windham.

The Agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
