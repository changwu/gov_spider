    For more than 40 years, from his service on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors to his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Sam Farr has worked tirelessly for the people of California. Sam has helped protect our oceans and our environment, remove trade barriers for Californian businesses, and promote travel and tourism throughout the United States. A proud alumnus of and advocate for the Peace Corps, Sam also has worked to improve lives in communities around the world. I look forward to continuing to work with Sam in the months ahead, and Michelle and I send him and his wife Shary our best wishes as they begin this new chapter of their lives.
