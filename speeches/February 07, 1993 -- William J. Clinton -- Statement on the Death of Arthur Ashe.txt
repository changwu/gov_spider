    I am deeply saddened by the death last night of Arthur Ashe. The embodiment of true sportsmanship, Arthur rose from the segregated courts of Richmond, VA, to the championship at Wimbledon displaying grace, strength, and courage every step of the way.
Arthur Ashe never rested with fame. He used the strength of his voice and the power of his example to open the doors of opportunity for other African-Americans, fighting discrimination in America and around the world.
In the last years of his life he continued his tenacious battle for others in the face of a disease he could not beat. He was a true American hero and a great example to us all.
