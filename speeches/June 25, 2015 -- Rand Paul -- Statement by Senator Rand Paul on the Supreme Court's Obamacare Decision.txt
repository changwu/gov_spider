    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Sen. Rand Paul issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold Obamacare subsidies: "This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head. Obamacare raises taxes, harms patients and doctors, and is the wrong fix for America's health care system.
As President I would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our healthcare system.
As a physician I know Americans need a healthcare system that reconnects patients, families, and doctors, rather than growing government bureaucracy," Sen. Rand Paul said.
