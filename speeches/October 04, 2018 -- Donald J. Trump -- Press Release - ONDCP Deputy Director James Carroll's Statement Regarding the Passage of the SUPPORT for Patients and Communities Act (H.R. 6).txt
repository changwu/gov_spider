    I commend Congress for passing this essential legislation, which will bolster our work to combat the opioid crisis. As the Trump Administration and Congress continue working together to combat our addiction crisis, we are very pleased to see the reauthorization of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. This legislation makes meaningful reforms to keep illicit drugs out of our communities and help people who are addicted get the treatment they need. I want to thank Members of Congress for leading this bipartisan effort to help our states and communities prevent drug use, treat addiction locally, and stop the flow of drugs into their communities.
