    I am grateful to Jim Jones for his service to this administration â€“ and to our nation. In a time of extraordinary challenge and change, he led our national security team with a steady hand, sound judgment and genuine decency. Jim never sought the position he is leaving; instead he answered once again the call to service. Like President Obama, I am thankful that he did.
Tom Donilon has been my friend and advisor for nearly 25 years. These past two years, he has been at the heart of our foreign and national security policies. He brings to his new responsibilities a remarkable depth of knowledge about the challenges and opportunities our country faces around the world. President Obama and I are fortunate to be able to rely on his counsel and leadership.
