Discussions With Prime Minister Hashimoto
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, the last time you met with Mr. Clinton, you gave him a saxophone. What are you going to do this time to make him happy? [Laughter]
The President. And I played it, too.
Prime Minister Hashimoto. What should I do about that? I think you're giving me more difficult questions than you're giving to the President. Well, it's a diplomatic secret. [Laughter]
