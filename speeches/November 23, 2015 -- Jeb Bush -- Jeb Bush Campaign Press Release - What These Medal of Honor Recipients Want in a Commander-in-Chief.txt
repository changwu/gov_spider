We've almost gone backwards where we should be going forward…And I think, Jeb Bush will push it forward. I want this nation to be the best nation in the world like it used to be. We need Jeb Bush, we really do." Jay Vargas, Colonel U.S. Marine Corps Retired

"When we join the military, we fill out a check and we say, pay to the order of up to and including my life…We need to elect a strong president who understands the value of freedom.

He represents the beliefs of this country." James Livingston, Major General U.S. Marine Corps Retired
