    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doak.
"I am thrilled to announce the endorsement of such a respected Oklahoma leader," Cruz said. "Commissioner Doak is a courageous conservative who has led the fight against Obamacare in Oklahoma, stands firm in his pro-life advocacy and has operated his agency under budget, returning $28.5 million in unspent funds to the state treasury. He joins an impressive group of conservatives supporting our campaign in Oklahoma, led by Congressman Jim Bridenstine."
"Ted Cruz is the trusted, consistent conservative we need in the White House," Doak said. "We can count on him to stop Obamacare, restore the rule of law, and follow the Constitution. I am honored to support him for president."
In 2011, John D. Doak became the 12th Insurance Commissioner of Oklahoma. He was sworn in to office for a second term on January 12, 2015, after receiving 77 percent of the vote. Doak is actively involved with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and currently serves on the Executive and Government Relations Committees.
Doak agrees with Cruz that regulation of insurance needs to be left to the states. Doak has been a small businessman and executive in the insurance industry for over two decades.
