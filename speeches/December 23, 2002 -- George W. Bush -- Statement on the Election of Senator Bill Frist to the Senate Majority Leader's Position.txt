    I congratulate Senator Bill Frist on his election to Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate. Senator Frist has earned the trust and respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I look forward to working with him and all Members of the Senate and House to advance our agenda for a safer, stronger, and better America.
