They have demonstrated remarkable professional achievement early in their careers, a commitment to public service, and the leadership skills needed to succeed at the highest levels of the Federal government.
National Finalists have advanced through a highly competitive selection process, including a comprehensive written application and regional interviews with civic leaders in eight different cities across the country.
