    I WILL BE obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those present at the dinner to Senator Morrow in New York this evening and also my deep sense of the great value of his work in improving the prison system of New Jersey, this being one of the outstanding contributions to prison administration made in this country which assisted in a sound background for the eight measures of reform of Federal prisons which we were able to enact in the last session of Congress, now placing the Federal Government to the forefront in these matters.
