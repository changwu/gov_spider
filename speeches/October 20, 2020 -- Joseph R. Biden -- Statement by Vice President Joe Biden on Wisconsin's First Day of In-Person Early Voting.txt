    As in-person early voting kicks off in Wisconsin today, Jill and I want to remind everyone to make a plan to vote and, if you can, vote early. You can be one of the first to move our country forward.
This election is bigger than any one candidate. The future of our economy, our health care, our climate, our commitment to racial justice, our democracy, and so much more is on the ballot. Together, we can beat President Trump and restore the soul of our nation.
