    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement tonight on his acceptance of an invitation from Liberty University to speak at the Sept. 14 convocation at the school in Lynchburg, Virginia:
"Liberty University was kind enough to invite me to address a convocation and I decided to accept. It goes without saying that my views on many issues – women's rights, gay rights, education – are very different from the opinions of some in the Liberty University community. I think it is important, however, to see if we can reach consensus regarding the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in our country, about the collapse of the middle class, about the high level of childhood poverty, about climate change and other issues.
"It is very easy for a candidate to speak to people who hold the same views. It's harder but important to reach out to others who look at the world differently. I look forward to meeting with the students and faculty of Liberty University."
