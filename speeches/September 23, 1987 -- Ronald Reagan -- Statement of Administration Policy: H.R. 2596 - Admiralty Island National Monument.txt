    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Young (R) Alaska and Rep. Miller (D) California)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2596. The bill would set undesirable precedents, such as granting Kootznoowoo Regional Corporation preferential rights to a timber sale area and changing the effective conveyance date for lands already granted by Congress to Kootznoowoo. Furthermore, requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with Kootznoowoo in preparing a study of land exchange options is unnecessary since such consultation can be done under existing authorities. Finally, the bill would unnecessarily increase the cost and complexity of managing National Forest System lands on Admiralty Island.
