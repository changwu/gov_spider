In-town pool report #1 — checking in 
Happy Monday, folks.
It's currently 57 degrees and drizzling at the White House. At the moment, POTUS has only 1 public event on his schedule: a 1:15pm infrastructure meeting with a bipartisan group of Congressional lawmakers, all of them former mayors and governors. Here's the attendee list as of last night, per the WH:<
The President will meet with Members of Congress to discuss the historic investments in the American Jobs Plan in the Oval Office. These Members of Congress represent a bipartisan, bicameral group of some of the former governors and mayors now on Capitol Hill. These former state and local elected officials understand firsthand the impact of a federal investment in rebuilding our nation's infrastructure on their communities.
Senator John Hickenlooper (CO)Senator John Hoeven (ND)Senator Angus King (ME)Senator Mitt Romney (UT)Senator Jeanne Shaheen (NH)Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05)Rep. Charlie Crist (FL-13)Rep. Carlos Giménez (FL-26)Rep. Kay Granger (TX-12)Rep. Norma Torres (CA-35)
We've also got a coronavirus advisory board briefing (10:30am) and Jen Psaki's daily press briefing (12:15pm). Both of those will be streamed here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
I'll send updates on any changes to the schedule as I receive them, and as always free to reach out to me directly with any questions.

In-town pool report #5 — in the Oval
Pool entered the Oval Office at 1:36pm.
POTUS was seated at one end of the room with members surrounding him.
POTUS opened by thanking his colleagues for coming... "I am prepared to compromise... It's a big package but there are a lot of needs"
Biden said discussions would focus on what will be in package and how to pay for it: "That's what we're going to try to figure out today..."
POTUS notes that all the members joining him were ex-mayors and govs so they know how to get stuff done at the local level.
Q: what do you think about paying for the plan with user fees?
A: that's what we're going to talk about today...
Pool was ushered out at 1:38pm

In-town pool report #9 — 4/20 virtual tour of Proterra plant
Passing along one final piece of background from the White House ahead of POTUS' Tuesday virtual tour of the Proterra plant in Greenville, South Carolina.
Tomorrow, the President will take a virtual tour of a Proterra electric bus and battery manufacturing plant in Greenville, South Carolina. There are over 475,000 school buses and 65,000 transit buses on our streets today, serving millions of students and transit riders. Most of these buses currently run on diesel, which has a negative impact on human health, especially for children.
The President made a commitment that all American-made buses would be zero-emission by 2030. To advance this goal, the American Jobs Plan includes a total of $45 billion to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission transit buses and school buses. This investment will create good jobs, support domestic manufacturing, tackle a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and improve health for some of our most vulnerable populations.
And that, as the kids say, is a wrap.
