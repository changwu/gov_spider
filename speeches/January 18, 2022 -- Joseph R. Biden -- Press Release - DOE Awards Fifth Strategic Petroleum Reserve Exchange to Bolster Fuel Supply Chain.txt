    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) approved a fifth exchange of 400,000 barrels of crude oil for release to Atlantic Trading and Marketing, Inc. from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). This release falls under the authorization published in the DOE announcement on November 23, 2021.
Combined, DOE has provided over eight million barrels of SPR crude oil to boost the nation's fuel supply, including four previous exchanges. As with all exchanges, companies that receive SPR crude oil through the exchange agree to return the amount of crude oil received, as well as an additional amount, dependent upon the length of time in which they hold the oil.
Additional information about SPR exchanges can be found here. Those interested in receiving future announcements from DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management can sign up here.
