Pool Report 6/Remarks
President Biden walked to a lectern at 2:07 at FEMA's national command center. The large room was full of workers seated at desks and also standing.
DHS Secretary Mayorkas introduced Biden, who began speaking at 2:09 and mentioned Administrator Criswell's trip to Florida and his calls with Gov. DeSantis about hurricane recovery.
He thanked the FEMA staffers for their hard work "with climate change really kicking in."
"There are still some deniers out there," he added.
He also mentioned Maui wildfire recovery briefly and called on Congress to approve more funding for federal disaster relief initiatives.
Remarks ended at 2:15 and Biden took some questions, including about Overdose Awareness Day, a possible government shutdown and Mitch McConnell.
He said he called McConnell today and "he was his old self." He said something about how his symptoms resemble those of a person who had a concussion.
Biden heard but didn't seem to orally answer questions about whether he would provide his bank records to Congress, as requested by Speaker McCarthy, to prevent his possible impeachment.
Biden said he is going to Florida on Saturday morning.
Around 2:19 the pool was pulled from the room as Biden shook hands and told FEMA workers people "need hope" during disasters.
