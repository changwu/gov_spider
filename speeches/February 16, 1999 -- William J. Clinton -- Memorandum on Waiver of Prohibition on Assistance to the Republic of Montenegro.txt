Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Presidential Certification to Waive Prohibition on Assistance to the Republic of Montenegro
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, including section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160), I hereby certify to the Congress that I have determined that the waiver of the application of the prohibition in section 1511(b) of Public Law 103-160 is necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to the parties, to the extent that such provision applies to the furnishing of assistance to the Republic of Montenegro.
Therefore, I hereby waive the application of this provision with respect to such assistance.
You are authorized and directed to transmit a copy of this determination to the Congress and arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
