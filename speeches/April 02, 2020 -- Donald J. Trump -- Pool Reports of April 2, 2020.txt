in-town pool report 1 - good morning
Hi, all,
As of 10:55 a.m. ET, President Trump has no public events listed on the available schedule, though the daily coronavirus task force on-camera press briefing at the White House is still scheduled for 5:00 p.m. ET today. I'll send along additional info. if/when that changes.
Out on the driveway earlier this a.m., Dr. Deborah Birx did a TV hit. Several reporters tried to ask her questions, ranging from Q's about the millions of newly uninsured Americans to her scarves, around 10:35 a.m. ET, but Dr. Birx did not stop to gaggle, with staff citing that she was late for a meeting.
I'm your print pooler for the day, so if you haven't been able to make it to the White House lately due to concerns/issues surrounding the virus, and if you have question(s) for the task force briefing later today, please feel free to message me directly, and I'll see if I can get to them. Thank you.
Everyone stay healthy out there.

in town pool report 5 - lid on the day
At 7:43 p.m. ET, the White House called a travel/photo lid. Apologies that I wasn't able to get to all of your submitted questions, re: the daily briefing, but I got in as many as I could.
To everyone, be healthy and safe and at least relatively happy out there. Take care, all.
