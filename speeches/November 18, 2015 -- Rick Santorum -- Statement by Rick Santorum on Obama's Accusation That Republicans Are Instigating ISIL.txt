    Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum (R-PA) issued the following statement in response to President Obama's remarks that Republican are creating a "potent recruiting tool" for ISIL through rhetoric.
Rick Santorum said:
"President Obama should be ashamed of himself, but sadly he is so ignorant to the threat posed by radical Islam that he doesn't even have a clue how wrong he is. Radical Islam is not exploiting Republican rhetoric. Radical Islam IS at war with the West!"
"Christians are being beheaded and crucified by these savages. People of good conscience who want to protect Christians are not recruiting tools for ISIL. While I disagree that accepting Christian refugees is in the long-term security interest of the United States and long-term stability interest of the Middle East, the intent of those who do should never be vilified."
"Barack Obama fundamentally does not understand the motivations of this enemy. He does not understand that they hate us, not for what we do, but they hate us for who we are and what we stand for. Radical Islam is intent on establishing a caliphate to spread their version of Islam, and in the case of Iran, developing a nuclear weapon to bring about the end of the World," continued Santorum.
"Barack Obama needs to get a grip on reality right now! Stop blaming Israel, stop blaming people with compassion for the persecuted, and start looking in the mirror. Otherwise, Iran will continue on the path to a nuclear weapon to bring about the return of their 12th Imam. ISIS will continue to kill innocent civilians through coordinated attacks. And all of the western World will remain in danger from a threat that is real and present. May God have mercy on us if we do not elect a President prepared to defeat with this enemy," concluded Santorum.
