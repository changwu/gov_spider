    By breaking the gridlock and ending the filibuster on national service today, the Senate scored two victories. It won one for the American people, but it also won one for the Senate itself, showing that when Democrats and Republicans work together, we can move America ahead.
National service will be America at its best, energizing our youth, meeting our Nation's needs, and reuniting all of us in the common work of citizenship. This legislation joins our Nation's finest traditions of building community, rewarding responsibility, and offering opportunity.
I want in particular to thank those Republicans who found the courage and vision to support this landmark legislation. When we put partisanship behind us and work together, we really can change America.
