    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention between the United States of America and the United Mexican States for the Recovery and Return of Stolen or Embezzled Vehicles and Aircraft, signed at Washington on January 15, 1981.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Convention represents an effort by the two Governments to confront the serious law enforcement problems posed by the theft of vehicles and aircraft, primarily along our shared border, and the subsequent use of some of them in the commission of felonies in the two countries. It would supersede the 1936 Convention for the Recovery and Return of Stolen or Embezzled Motor Vehicles, Trailers, Airplanes or Component Parts of Any of Them, which has been found inadequate to meet present law enforcement needs. I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this treaty at an early date.
