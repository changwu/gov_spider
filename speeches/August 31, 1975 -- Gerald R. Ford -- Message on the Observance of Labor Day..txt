    LABOR DAY assumes a special significance this year as we prepare to celebrate our National Bicentennial. Designated to honor America's working men and women, Labor Day offers an excellent opportunity to review these contributions in the light of the new goals that will guide us in the third century of our independence.
America's workers are our national strength. Their skills have forged our greatness. Their pride in quality craftsmanship sustains it. We owe the unprecedented progress we have realized in this century to the initiative, determination and talent of the American worker.
We are a nation of working men and women whose willingness to sacrifice and eagerness to support responsible economic policies have pulled us through many rough periods in our past. This record provides inspiration and encouragement in this difficult time. It also gives those of us who work in Government an extra incentive to honor the trust our working citizens have placed in us by ensuring wise, responsive and sensitive planning for our future.
I pledge my wholehearted commitment to this task.
