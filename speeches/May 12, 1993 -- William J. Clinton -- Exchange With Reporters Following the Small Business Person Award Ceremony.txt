Associate Attorney General Nominee
Q. Do you still back Webb Hubbell's nomination?
The President. Of course. Why wouldn't I?
Q. What about the Republican calls for him to resign?
The President. A little inconsistency in their position. Look how they voted on a lot of other people.
Q. Such as who?
Deficit Reduction
Q. Mr. President, why do you feel you have to make this guarantee on deficit reduction?
The President. I just think it will help to reinforce the commitment that we already have: no taxes without spending cuts; all the taxes go to the deficit. I think that's what we ought to do. That's the way we set it up. Now we'll just put it into the law. It will be even better.
Q. What effects do you think it will have on Congress?
The President. It's consistent with what I did as the Governor at home, too. When I raised money at home for education, we put it into education, and it can only be spent on that.
Q. Is it a compromise?
The President. Gosh, no. It makes it better. I mean, I don't know who— compromise—I don't know if anybody's against it. But I think it's the right thing to do.
