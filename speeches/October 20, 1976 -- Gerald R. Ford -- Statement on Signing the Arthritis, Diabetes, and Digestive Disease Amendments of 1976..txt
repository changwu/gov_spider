    I HAVE signed S. 2910, the Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive Disease Amendments of 1976. Arthritis, diabetes, and diseases of the digestive tract affect millions of Americans and claim an inestimable toll in human suffering and disability among our citizens and their families.
A major purpose of S. 2910 is the establishment of national advisory boards for diabetes and arthritis, and a National Commission on Digestive Diseases to develop a long-range plan for the control of digestive diseases.
Since S. 2910 will clearly provide appropriate support of our efforts to solve the problems associated with these diseases, it has my enthusiastic endorsement. The state of the art study and development of the long-range plan by the National Commission on Digestive Diseases, for example, will be very helpful to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in planning its programs in this area.
The enactment of S. 2910 will aid the Government's efforts to alleviate the problems of those afflicted with these serious and disabling diseases. I am happy to approve it.
