    Legislation Will Be Sent to the President
WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that her effort to require the Department of Defense to consider the national security risks posed by global warming has received final Congressional approval as part of the revised Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The provision will require the Pentagon to address these risks in the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Quadrennial Defense Review.
This is the second time that Congress has approved the DoD Authorization Conference Report. President Bush vetoed the first version last month.
"We must act to address all the dangers posed by global warming, including where our national security is concerned. Congress's vote will guarantee that the administration is taking all due steps to address these challenges," said Senator Clinton.
The Clinton amendment implements many of the recommendations of a report authored by eleven retired three and four-star admirals and generals and released by the CNA Corporation in April. The study, "National Security and the Threat of Climate Change," concluded that global warming presents a "serious national security threat." The study examines how projected climate changes, such as rising sea levels, more intense tropical storms, increased flooding and drought, will have destabilizing impacts, including reduced access to fresh water, impaired food production, and displacement of major populations. The study concludes that these impacts could act as a "threat multiplier" and increase the potential for failed states, cause mass migrations that add to global tensions, and increase conflict over resources.
