    PHILADELPHIA â€“ Presidential candidate Nikki Haley released the following statements on the Supreme Court's rulings today:
On the Christian website designer case:
"Unlike in other countries, we don't force our citizens to express themselves in ways that conflict with their religious beliefs. It's called the First Amendment. I'm glad we have a Supreme Court that respects our Constitution."
On the student loans case:
"A president cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors, while leaving out all those who worked hard to pay back their loans or made other career choices. The Supreme Court was right to throw out Joe Biden's power grab."
