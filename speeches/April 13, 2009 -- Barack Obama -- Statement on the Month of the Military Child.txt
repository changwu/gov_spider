    In 1986, April was designated as the Month of the Military Child, and I am proud to mark the special recognition the Department of Defense has given to military children.
Like all Americans, I am grateful to the brave men and women in uniform who are serving our Nation. They are the living embodiment of the ideals of sacrifice, honor, and duty that have always made this Nation great, and their sacrifice is their families' sacrifice too; their children, especially, display tremendous strength and courage each day, bravely bearing the burden of having a loved one serving in harm's way. They may move many times across the Nation and even around the world as they grow up. They may not see their loved ones for months on end. It is not easy, and Michelle and I, as well as the Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden, admire and are deeply grateful to each and every one of them.
I call on all Americans to keep military children in their thoughts and prayers and to do their part to reach out to and support them and their families.
