    I applaud Members of the United States Senate for voting to strengthen our laws against convicted sex offenders.
The "Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006" will ensure appropriate sentencing for sex offenders and will provide local law enforcement officials with thetools they need to track those who prey upon children. By supporting this legislation, the Senate has taken an important step towards providing our country with a strict, uniform system for monitoring sex offenders to ensure that they do not commit additional crimes against our Nation's children.
I urge the House of Representatives to pass this good legislation as quickly as possible, so that I can sign it into law.
