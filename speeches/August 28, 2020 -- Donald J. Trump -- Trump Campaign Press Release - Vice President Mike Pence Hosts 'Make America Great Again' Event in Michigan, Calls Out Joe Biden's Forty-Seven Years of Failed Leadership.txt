    Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Traverse City, Michigan to deliver a strong condemnation of Joe Biden's nearly half-century of bad policies and leadership. While in Washington, Joe Biden has shipped jobs overseas, undermined our strength and security, and repeatedly attacked American values. Vice President Pence reiterated the need to re-elect President Trump in order to recover from the ongoing pandemic and Make America Great Again:
"Ask yourself who do you trust to rebuild this economy over the next four years. A career politician who presided over the slowest recovery from a recession since the Great Depression? Or do you trust a proven leader who created jobs at a record pace across America and will do it again? The choice is clear: to bring America all the way back we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House."
