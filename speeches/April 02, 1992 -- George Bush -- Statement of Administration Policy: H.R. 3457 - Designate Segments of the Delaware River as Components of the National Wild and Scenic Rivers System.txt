    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/3/92)(House)(Kostmayer (D) PA and Zimmer (R) NJ)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3457 because the river segments proposed for designation do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The proposed river segments have significant development along the shoreline and lack the outstanding natural and cultural characteristics required to make them eligible for inclusion in the System.
