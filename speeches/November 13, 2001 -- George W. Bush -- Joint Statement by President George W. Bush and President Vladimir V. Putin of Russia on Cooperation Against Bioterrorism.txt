    At Shanghai, we resolved to enhance cooperation in combating new terrorist threats, including those involving weapons of mass destruction.
We agree that, as a key element of our cooperation to counter the threat of terrorist use of biological materials, officials and experts of the United States and Russia will work together on means for countering the threat of bioterrorism, now faced by all nations, and on related health measures, including preventive ones, treatment and possible consequence management. We will continue to work to enhance the security of materials, facilities, expertise, and technologies that can be exploited by bioterrorists. We also confirm our strong commitment to the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.
We have directed all of our officials and experts working on these critical matters to expand their cooperation and to consult on strengthening related international efforts.
