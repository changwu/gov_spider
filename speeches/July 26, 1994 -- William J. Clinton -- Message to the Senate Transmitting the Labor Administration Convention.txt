    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of the Convention (No. 150) Concerning Labor Administration: Role, Functions and Organization, adopted by the International Labor Conference at its 64th Session in Geneva on June 7, 1978.
The report of the Department of State, with a letter from the Secretary of Labor, concerning the Convention is enclosed.
As explained more fully in the enclosed letter from the Secretary of Labor, the current system of labor administration in the United States fully satisfies the requirements of Convention No. 150. Ratification of this Convention, therefore, would not require the United States to alter its law or practice in this field.
Ratification of additional International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions will enhance the ability of the United States to take other governments to task for failing to comply with the ILO instruments they have ratified. I recommend that the Senate give its advice and consent to the ratification of ILO Convention No. 150.
