Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President Homeland Security Policy Advisory Group. This group of men and women will be tasked with advising Governor Romney on issues pertaining to America's homeland security including border security, infrastructure security and transportation security.
"Protecting our homeland requires a comprehensive approach that secures our border, protects critical infrastructure and integrates intelligence to detect threats to our security. Ensuring that the American people are secure means working across agencies and levels of government," said Governor Romney. "The men and women of this group bring extensive experience from Congress, homeland security, law enforcement and business to our efforts to craft the strategies needed to protect the United States. I look forward to their counsel and working closely with them on this vital issue."
The Homeland Security Policy Advisory Group will be chaired by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), who also advises Governor Romney on judicial matters.

He oversaw security efforts at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, served on the President's Homeland Security Advisory Council, and brought innovative tactics to Massachusetts' homeland security strategy.
