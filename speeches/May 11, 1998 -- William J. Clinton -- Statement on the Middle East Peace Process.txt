    I have just met with Secretary Albright, National Security Adviser Berger, and Ambassador Ross. Unfortunately, there will not be a meeting today with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to launch the permanent status talks. I regret that.
I have asked Secretary Albright to meet later this week with Prime Minister Netanyahu while he is in Washington. The objective of those discussions will be to seek to overcome the remaining differences so that we can proceed immediately with accelerated permanent status talks.
Secretary Albright will then report to me whether, as a result of her discussions with the Prime Minister, the basis exists to launch those talks in Washington.
