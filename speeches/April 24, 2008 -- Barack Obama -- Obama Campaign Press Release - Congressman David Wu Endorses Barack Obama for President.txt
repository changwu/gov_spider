    Portland, OR - Today U.S. Congressman David Wu from Oregon announced his support for Senator Barack Obama for president, citing his ability to make real change:
"I think we are blessed to have two strong candidates for president," Congressman David Wu said. "I am endorsing Barack Obama for president today because I believe that he is best suited to turn the page on this sorry episode in American history. He and I both had the judgment to oppose the Iraq War from the very beginning.
"Every dollar that we have spent in Iraq-which adds up to over $500 billion so far-is a dollar not spent at home, a school not built, a bridge not repaired," continued Wu. "We need new policies both at home and abroad. Like Americans, the international community wants to see real change in America and I believe that Senator Obama embodies that change."
"I thank Congressman Wu for his support, and look forward to working with him to bring this war in Iraq to an end, strengthening our economy and addressing the issue of climate change," said Senator Barack Obama.
Congressman Wu is in his fifth term representing Oregon's First Congressional District.
Wu is Senator Obama's 240th Superdelegate endorsement. Senator Obama is now 291 delegates away from winning the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
