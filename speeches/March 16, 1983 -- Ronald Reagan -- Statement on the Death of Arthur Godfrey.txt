    Arthur Godfrey was a familiar face and voice to millions of Americans over several generations and a broadcasting pioneer. In a long career, he not only won national popularity but triumphed over illness and physical disability in a way that was an inspiration to his fans. His tireless dedication to protecting our environment was one of many worthy causes he espoused as a concerned citizen.
Nancy and I join with Arthur Godfrey's family and countless friends and admirers in mourning the passing of an outstanding American.
