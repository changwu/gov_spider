    "What President Obama says is if you built a small business, you're not the result of that success. It's not because of you, it's because of somebody else, it's because of government. What the President rarely does is drop his veil about the true identity of his political philosophy. In this particular instance, he did that. He's done that before on a couple of occasions. He did it again. He just believes in a government-run economy and a government-centered society. We don't agree with that vision." â€” Rep. Paul Ryan

MARIA BARTIROMO: "So what about that, Congressman? Did Romney twist the President's words?"
REP. PAUL RYAN: "No, actually if you look at the President's words in perpetuity, in the full context, it's exactly what Mitt Romney said. Mitt Romney did not say President Obama doesn't like small business. What President Obama says is if you built a small business, you're not the result of that success. It's not because of you, it's because of somebody else, it's because of government. What the President rarely does is drop his veil about the true identity of his political philosophy. In this particular instance, he did that. He's done that before on a couple of occasions. He did it again. He just believes in a government-run economy and a government-centered society. We don't agree with that vision. We agree with the Founders vision. We agree with economic freedom, limited government, an opportunity society with a safety net where yes, if you're an entrepreneur, you work hard and you take risks, that is your success. We should be proud of that success and we should not be denigrating people who are successful by suggesting that it's not their result of their hard work, that it's somebody else or that it's some big government experiment that is the reason for their success in life."
