    Ron Paul Draws Big Crowds on Second of Two-Day Trip to Iowa Four town hall meetings yield a sizable outpouring of committed and new supporters
ANKENY, Iowa — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul again attracted big crowds at all four of his events in Eastern Iowa, closing out a two-day trip before he returns for a three-day trip to Central and Western Iowa next week.Crowds of this size would be uncommon had the 12-term Congressman from Texas not done this in Iowa just yesterday. Or, had he not done so previously at Youth for Ron Paul events in Iowa that recently gained national media coverage.
Paul's Jackson County Town Hall Meeting in Maquoketa attracted more than 200 people, noteworthy for the small venue, town, and county in which it occurred. The Dubuque Town Hall Meeting at the Grand River Center saw more than 350 people. The Delaware County Town Hall Meeting on the Delaware County Fairgrounds netted more than 150, exceptional for a small community. Finally, Ron Paul's Cedar Rapids Town Hall Meeting at The Hotel at Kirkwood Center — expected to be a large event — exceeded turnout estimates with more than 350 supporters.
