    The United States is encouraged by recent developments in the Colombia peace negotiations, including the six-month timeline for signing a final agreement. We are hopeful that negotiations will conclude successfully and lay the foundation for a lasting peace after more than 50 years of armed conflict. Sixteen years ago, the United States launched with broad bipartisan support Plan Colombia, a comprehensive program to support the Colombian government and people. Last year, at the request of President Santos, we appointed a Special Envoy to the Colombia Peace Process. We will continue to stand by Colombia to end the armed conflict and foster prosperity throughout the country. We congratulate President Santos and his team for their deep commitment to peace in Colombia and this major step toward a final accord.
