    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Food Aid Convention 1999, which was open for signature at the United Nations Headquarters, New York, from May 1 through June 30, 1999. The Convention was signed by the United States June 16, 1999. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Food Aid Convention 1999 replaces the Food Aid Convention 1995. Donor members continue to make minimum annual commitments that can be expressed either in the quantity or, under the new Convention, the value of the food aid they will provide to developing countries.
As the United States has done in the past, it is participating provisionally in the Food Aid Committee. The Committee granted the United States (and other countries) a 1-year extension of time, until June 30, 2000, in which to deposit its instrument of ratification.
It is my hope that the Senate will give prompt and favorable consideration to this Convention, and give its advice and consent to ratification by the United States at the earliest possible date.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 13, 1999.
