    Today, First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to meet with wounded service members recovering from injuries sustained while overseas. Upon arrival, Mrs. Trump was greeted by Colonel Rodney Gonzalez, Chief of Staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center, and Dr. Jesse Schonau, currently serving with the White House Medical Unit.
The First Lady presented the Purple Heart to a wounded warrior recently injured during combat. Also present were members of the wounded warrior's family.
Mrs. Trump met with two other injured service members and their families. All three patients have deployed multiple times and all three are expected to recover from their injuries.
"I want to thank the service members I met today," First Lady Melania Trump said. "As each of them recovers, we are reminded of the cost of our country's security. I am grateful to each of these warriors and their families for what they sacrifice for our country. The President and I will always stand with our men and women in uniform. I also want to thank all the medical leadership and staff at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for the care and support they give our military members."
