    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Reps. Udall (D) Arizona and Fascell (D) Florida)
The Administration urges prompt House consideration of H.J.Res. 187 as amended by the Senate under a rule that would allow consideration of a comprehensive amendment encompassing agreements reached between the House and Senate managers, the representatives of the freely associated States, and the Administration.
The comprehensive amendment would modify the Senate-passed resolution to (1) reduce the amount of compensation to the Micronesians for the loss of investment incentives included in the negotiated compact to $30 million, the highest figure the Administration could accept, and (2) clarify the language regarding Federal implementation of the Compact.
The Administration's support for the comprehensive amendment to H.J.Res. 187 depends upon the inclusion of these two elements. The Administration is not aware of the need for, nor does it support, any further amendments.
