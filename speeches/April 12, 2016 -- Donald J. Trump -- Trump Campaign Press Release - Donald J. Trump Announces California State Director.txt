    (New York, NY) April 12th, 2016 â€“ Today, Donald J. Trump announced that he has hired veteran California GOP strategist Tim Clark to direct the campaign's California effort. Clark has 20-plus years of experience running Republican campaigns in California, and has also served as a campaign advisor to several State GOP Chairmen.
Mr. Trump stated, "I am pleased to bring Tim on board to organize what is a very important state. I know he will be an asset to the team and ultimately deliver a win in California."
"This is an exciting time for the Republican Party," said Tim Clark. "Donald Trump's message of fiscally sound government, restored economic prosperity, and strong national security is reenergizing our Party's conservative base."
"We have a very important job to do in California," continued Clark. "By harnessing the excitement surrounding Mr. Trump's candidacy, it's our intention to deliver one-hundred and seventy-two delegates for Trump to the national convention."
Tim will build out a top-tier state-wide operation and Mr. Trump will be traveling to California several times before the primary in June, where he currently leads in all state polls.
