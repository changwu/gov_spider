    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revised(House)(Waxman (D) California and 11 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 2370, because the bill continues large obsolete Federal training subsidies designed to meet nursing shortages of the 1960's â€” not the surpluses of the 1980's. The Administration's proposals target nursing funds on needy students through improvements in the Nursing Student Loan program.
