LAKE JACKSON, Texasâ€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul remains competitive in the race for the nomination according to a new Reuters/Ipsos Poll.
Paul scores a solid second with 21 percent of the vote, faring better nationally than fellow GOP competitors Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. These latest numbers show Paul gaining on his main competitor nationally, Mitt Romney, whose support seems to be fading with 29 percent. Paul's support grew by 5 percentage points nationally since January, while Romney has seen a 30 percent decline in his support since January.
"This poll further illustrates that Ron Paul is emerging as the real conservative alternative to Mitt Romney, and that he can also obtain the needed support from Independents and disenfranchised Democrats to defeat President Obama in November." said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
This poll follows a January 30th Gallup Poll showing Paul within the margin of error of defeating Obama. Also, a January 16th CNN/ORC Poll showed Paul and Obama in a virtual tie in a general election showdown.
