    Twenty-five years ago, a suicide bomb destroyed the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. We remember the 241 American marines, soldiers, and sailors who lost their lives in that attack, and we pay tribute to their families and loved ones. The U.S. forces in Lebanon were serving as part of the multinational force working to bring peace and security to that country, torn by years of civil war.
On the anniversary of this unconscionable attack, we honor the memory of those brave service men and women through our commitment to succeeding in the war on terror. We express our gratitude to those serving abroad to protect America and promote peace and freedom around the world. And we reiterate our strong support for the voices of moderation and justice in Lebanon.
