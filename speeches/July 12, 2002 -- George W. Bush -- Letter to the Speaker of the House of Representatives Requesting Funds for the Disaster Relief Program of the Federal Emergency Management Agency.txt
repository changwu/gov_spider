    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-73, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, I hereby request and make available $500 million for the disaster relief program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
These funds would allow FEMA to continue providing assistance to victims of disasters in several States, including victims of recent flooding in Texas and wild fires in Arizona and Colorado. These funds would also be available for ongoing response to prior disasters and to ensure that FEMA has resources on hand to provide timely response to future disasters.
I designate the funds made available today as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
The details of this action are set forth in the attached letter from the Director of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
