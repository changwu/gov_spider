    Mr. Prime Minister, Begum Sahiba:
With a deep sense of the historical import of this occasion, and with the greatest personal pleasure, I am happy to welcome you both to the United States. Mrs. Truman and I, and the Americans throughout our country, have been looking forward to your arrival. We are glad you have found it possible to do us the honor of visiting us, and are thankful that you have been granted a safe journey.
The many Americans who have had the privilege of visiting Pakistan are unanimous in their praise of your heart-warming hospitality. I hope that while you are in the United States you will feel as much at home as Americans do when they visit your great country. It is likewise my sincere hope that in the course of your stay you will find that Americans and Pakistanis have much in common.
Knowing that the number of invitations from Americans wishing to extend hospitality has far exceeded the number which your sojourn in the United States will permit you to accept, I wish at this time to extend a warm and heartfelt welcome on behalf of all the American people.
