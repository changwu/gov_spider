    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report one proposal to rescind $30.0 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting four new deferrals of budget authority totalling $55.1 million and two revisions to previously transmitted deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $0.7 million in budget authority.
The rescission proposal affects the Department of Agriculture's drought and flood assistance program. The new deferrals and revisions to existing deferrals involve programs in the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and the Interior, the Corps of Engineers, and the International Communication Agency.
The details of the rescission proposal and the deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
