    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by an earthquake on December 22, 2003, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the county of San Luis Obispo.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the earthquake in the counties of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara.
