    To the Senate of the United States:
A convention having been concluded between John C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, especially authorized therefor by me, and the chiefs and headmen of the Cherokee Nation of Indians, likewise duly authorized and empowered by said nation, I now lay the original instrument before the Senate for the exercise of its constitutional power respecting the ratification thereof.
JAMES MONROE.
