    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest web video, entitled "Where is Obama?" The web video highlights Democrats, Republicans and Hillary Clinton supporters in Chicago speaking to Barack Obama's lack of leadership in the Hispanic Community in Illinois. While Barack Obama promises much for the Hispanic-American community on the campaign trail, these Democrats and Republicans wonder where Barack Obama has been during his years in the Illinois State Senate and United States Senate. The web video will be featured today during a press conference in New Mexico.
