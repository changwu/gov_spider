    Iowa State Representative Renee Schulte made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's record:
"The differences between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are clear. Mitt Romney spent his life working as a conservative businessman, growing businesses and creating jobs. Newt Gingrich spent the last decades in Washington as a professional politician, and only left to cash in. The problems facing our country were caused by career politicians â€” they certainly won't be solved by another career politician."
