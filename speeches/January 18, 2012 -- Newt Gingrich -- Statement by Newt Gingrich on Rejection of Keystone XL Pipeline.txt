Aiken, SC-Newt Gingrich released the following statement following the Obama administration's announcement today rejecting the Keystone XL Pipeline:
"President Obama's decision to reject the XL pipeline weakens America's national security and kills thousands of well paying American jobs.
Along with yesterday's decision to cancel the long planned U.S.-Israeli war game, the Obama administration is signaling extraordinary national security weakness at a time when the Iranian regime is threatening to shut down the Straits of Hormuz.
President Obama has made it clear once again that he is committed to Saul Alinksy radicalism at the expense of working Americans. This radicalism is especially evident in today's decision given that just 24 hours ago President Obama's own Panel on Jobs and Competitiveness published a report calling for the creation of new jobs through the construction of pipelines like Keystone XL Pipeline and the expansion of oil and gas production.
At a time when American families and businesses are facing record high gas prices and a weak economy, the President has made clear that is not going to do anything to help them. I will grant the permit to build the Keystone XL Pipeline on my first day in the Oval Office, as well as unleash domestic energy production to strengthen the economy and create jobs."
