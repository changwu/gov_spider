    In much of our Nation, the early part of summer has brought a chance to explore the outdoors or enjoy a day at the beach or lake. But in large parts of the eastern United States, these first weeks of summer have brought record high temperatures, extreme discomfort, and for some, severe danger.
Up and down the eastern seaboard, and as far west as Michigan, temperatures over the past 2 weeks soared to levels more than 30 percent higher than average for this time of year. Temperatures that hit the nineties and beyond can pose grave risks to the elderly, the very young, the disabled, and the ill. Tragically, this heat wave has already claimed the lives of more than 100 people.
Today I am releasing $100 million to help low income Americans in the affected areas cope with this terrible and life-threatening heat. These funds will help victims of the heat wave pay for the costs associated with home cooling, so that they are able to purchase air conditioners and fans and pay their electricity bills.
These resources will help protect the most vulnerable among us as the current heat wave runs its course.
