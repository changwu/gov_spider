  Dr. Paul shatters expectations, proves strength of candidacy

AMES, Iowaâ€” Congressman Ron Paul won 4,671 votes in today's Iowa Republican Straw Poll, topping Governor Mitt Romney's vote total from 2007 and drawing a near statistical tie with today's winner at 27.6 percent of the vote versus 28.5 percent.
Dr. Paul's finish earned him a strong second place and it was the fourth highest vote total ever received by a candidate at the important test of candidate strength.
Said campaign chairman Jesse Benton,
"Dr. Paul is surging in this race, and today's results show the strength of his grassroots support and top notch organization.
"These straw poll results, our growing poll numbers and our strong fundraising shows that our message is resonating with Iowans and Americans everywhere.
"Our message was the same in 2007 as it is in now in 2011, but this time we have quadrupled our support. That means our message is spreading, our support is surging, and people are taking notice.
"We are uniting a coalition of longtime supporters, fiscal conservatives, constitutional conservatives, independents, tea party and anti-big government activists to take on the Washington establishment.
"Today, Ron Paul has emerged as a top tier candidate and is a serious contender to win the Republican nomination and the Presidency."
