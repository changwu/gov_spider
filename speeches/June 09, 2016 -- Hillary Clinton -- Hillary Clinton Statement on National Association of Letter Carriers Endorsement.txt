    Today, following the endorsement of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and their 290,000 members, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the National Association of Letter Carriers.
"The Postal Service is consistently ranked as the most trusted government agency, and the brothers and sisters of NALC are one reason why. Since our nation's founding, efficient and effective mail service has connected families and enabled commerce. Today, more than 160 billion pieces of mail travel through the postal system each year—many of them in the hands of a Letter Carrier.
"As President, I will stand with the Letter Carriers to protect workers' fundamental rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security. And I will work with the Letter Carriers to build a bright future for the postal system and postal workers in the 21st century. I know that the postal system is still a vital lifeline for American communities from coast to coast, and recognize the Letter Carriers' vital role in building the American middle class.
"Above all, workers deserve a seat at the table and a champion in the White House. Because when workers are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
