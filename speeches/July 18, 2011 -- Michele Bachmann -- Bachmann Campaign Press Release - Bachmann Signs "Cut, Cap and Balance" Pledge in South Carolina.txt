    Columbia, S.C. — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann signed the "Cut, Cap and Balance" Pledge today during a campaign stop in Columbia, South Carolina. Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) has authored and championed the Pledge, which represents a critical first step in the fight to rein in the Obama administration's out-of-control spending. In keeping with her priorities, Bachmann added a line to the pledge — the repeal and defunding of Obamacare. Bachmann is proud to join Senator DeMint in his fight to encourage legislators to address the $14.4 trillion national debt and set the stage for fiscal responsibility for future generations.
"The principles found in this Pledge are a historic step in the right direction toward the fundamental restructuring we need in the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars," Bachmann said. "I commend Senator DeMint for his tireless and relentless efforts to fight for America's taxpayers, for America's economy, and for America's future."
Bachmann continued, "In signing the Pledge, I am adding a line; I also pledge that along with cutting spending, putting in place enforceable spending caps, and passing a balanced budget amendment, we must repeal and defund Obamacare."
With signing this Pledge, Bachmann is speaking for the many voices from across the country that will face the devastating impact and uncertainty of Obamacare on their businesses and families.
"Obamacare is the largest spending and entitlement program in our nation's history," Bachmann said. "Without its repeal, we cannot have real economic reform."
