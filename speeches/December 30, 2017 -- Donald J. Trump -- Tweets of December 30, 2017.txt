Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regimes corruption & its squandering of the nations wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their peoples rights including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtestsRetweets: 60821Favorites: 138901

On Taxes: This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow. Now real economics and jobs. @WSJ ReportRetweets: 16703Favorites: 73325

I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair press now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent sources are being used more often than ever. Many stories & reports a pure fiction!Retweets: 50342Favorites: 195754
