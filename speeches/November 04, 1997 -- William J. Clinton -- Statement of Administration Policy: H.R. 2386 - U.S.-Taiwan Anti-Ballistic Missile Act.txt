    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Hunter (R) CA and 13 cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2386, which would require a study on the architecture requirements of establishing a missile-defense system in the Asia-Pacific region for the protection of Taiwan. This study is unnecessary and unhelpful.
Taiwan's air defense needs are being met; Taiwan has purchased Modified Air Defense systems comparable to recent versions of the Patriot Advanced Capability system. U.S. dialogue with Taiwan on this subject is well-established. A regional missile-defense arrangement is not the best means of providing Taiwan a sufficient self-defense capability.
