    Roy Wilkins worked for equality, spoke for freedom, and marched for justice. His quiet and unassuming manner masked his tremendous passion for civil and human rights.
He once said, "The heritage of a man of peace will endure and shine into the darkness of this world." Although Roy's death darkens our day, the accomplishments of his life will continue to endure and shine forth.
I convey my deepest sympathy to his family, to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] that he helped to build, and to all people who shared his devotion to the dignity of human life.
