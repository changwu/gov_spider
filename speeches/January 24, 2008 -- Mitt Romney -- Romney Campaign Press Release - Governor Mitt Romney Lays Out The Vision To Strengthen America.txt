Boca Raton, FL â€“ Tonight, Romney for President Communications Director Matt Rhoades released the following statement on the Florida Republican presidential debate:
"The economic challenges confronting our country were central to tonight's debate. Governor Romney is the only candidate with a record of working in the real economy and creating jobs.

That is the leadership we need in Washington, and in a few short days, the people of Florida will cast their votes for change in this country."
