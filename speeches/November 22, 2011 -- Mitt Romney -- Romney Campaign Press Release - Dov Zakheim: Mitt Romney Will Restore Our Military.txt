    Mitt Romney's Special Adviser on Foreign Policy and former Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Dov Zakheim made the following statement after tonight's debate in Washington, DC:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by demonstrating that he is the best candidate to restore our military, defend American interests, and foster peace abroad. Governor Romney deeply understands that preserving U.S. national security requires a strong military. In the face of multiple, massive, and dangerous cuts to the defense budget under President Obama, America needs a principled and determined leader in the White House who will keep faith with our uniformed men and women, repair our special relationships with friends and allies, and ensure America's leadership role in the world. That leader is Mitt Romney."
