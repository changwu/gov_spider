    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conyers (D) Michigan and 109 others)
Although the Administration is sympathetic to the desire of supporters of H.R. 3193 for reliable data to assess the extent of "hate crimes," it opposes enactment of the bill. The bill would establish unrealistic requirements which would, at best, be difficult and expensive to observe and would impose unnecessary burdens on law enforcement officials at the Federal, State, and local levels. Indeed, there is widespead doubt among professional statisticians familiar with the criminal justice system that reliable data of the kind contemplated can be produced.
