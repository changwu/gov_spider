  A Proclamation

In June 1956, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 and the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 were enacted to provide for the construction and financing of the National Interstate and Defense Highway System. Nineteen hundred and eighty-six marks the 30th anniversary of the passage of this legislation.
During the last 30 years, the construction of the Interstate System has brought about tremendous change and progress in our society. As the world's largest and most successful transportation and public works project, it has enhanced travel and has helped join the Nation together to supply raw material, finished goods, food, and other essential products and services, and contributed to the national defense.
The Interstate System accounts for just over one percent of the total road mileage in the United States, yet it carries approximately 20 percent of the Nation's total traffic volume. Employing the most advanced highway safety designs ever devised, the Interstate System is one of the Nation's safest modes of transportation.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 636, has designated June 26, 1986, as "National Interstate Highway Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 26, 1986, as National Interstate Highway Day, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
