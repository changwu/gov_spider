    Today Education Secretary Margaret Spellings released the report of a commission whose focus was to help make America's higher education system more affordable and more accessible and to provide parents and students with information that will help them make better-informed choices. I strongly support the thrust of this important report and look forward to working with Secretary Spellings, the higher education community, the Congress, and the States to ensure that our higher education system remains the finest in the world.
America's colleges and universities have always played an important role in advancing innovation, opportunity, and prosperity throughout our Nation and the world. We must all work to provide our students with the knowledge and skills they need to shape a hopeful future for our country.
