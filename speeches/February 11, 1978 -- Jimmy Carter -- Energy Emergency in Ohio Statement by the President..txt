    Based on a petition submitted to me by the Governor of the State of Ohio, pursuant to Section 110(f) of the Clean Air Act, I hereby determine that a regional energy emergency exists in the State of Ohio of such severity that a temporary suspension of certain particulate control regulations under the Ohio Air Quality Implementation Plan may be necessary, and that other means of responding to the energy emergency may be inadequate. This determination shall be effective for not more than thirty (30) days, provided that the State of Ohio shall hold the public hearing required by Section 110(f) of the Clean Air Act within 1 week of this determination. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency retains full authority to disapprove temporary suspensions of regulations in Ohio on a case-by-case basis and to exercise his emergency powers authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and if necessary.
I urge the Governor to act with due care if he suspends air pollution regulations under the authority provided by this determination, since such regulations are important to protect public health.
