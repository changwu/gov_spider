    President Donald J. Trump applauds the House of Representatives for its work on the "Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017," which passed the House today. This bipartisan piece of legislation provides important tools for Federal prosecutors and State officials to fight the scourge of sex trafficking. The Administration remains concerned about certain provisions in the bill, as expressed in the Department of Justice's technical assistance, and hopes that these issues can be resolved in a final bill presented to the President for signature. The President looks forward to continuing to work with Congress in order to hold people who participate in human trafficking accountable for their horrific crimes.
