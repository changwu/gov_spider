    The President was very disappointed to learn of the action taken by President Fujimori in suspending the Peruvian Constitution and dissolving the Congress and the judiciary. This is a regrettable step backwards for the cause of democracy in the hemisphere. We will be consulting with other countries in the hemisphere and are currently reviewing our assistance programs to Peru. We urge a rapid return to constitutional rule.
