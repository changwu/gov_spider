    The Hillary Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of California Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, illustrating the continued growing support Senator Clinton has in the Golden State.
"America is ready for a leader who will end the war in Iraq and a president who will respect our Armed Forces and military families," said Rep. Tauscher. "Hillary Clinton is the candidate with the experience to lead our country and I'm confident she will make a great President. I am very proud to endorse her candidacy."
Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher is currently serving her sixth term and is Chair of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, becoming only the third woman in history to Chair an Armed Services Subcommittee. Rep. Tauscher is also the first California Democrat to be elevated to an Armed Services Subcommittee Chairmanship since 1992. She is a leader on defense, homeland security, high-tech, transportation and veterans' issues and is known as one of Congress's leading experts on nuclear nonproliferation.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Tauscher has taken an active role in foreign policy and national security. She has traveled to the Middle East five times since the start of the Iraq war, including three trips to Iraq, and has visited troops and foreign leaders in Afghanistan and other Central Asian countries while serving in Congress.
"I am honored to have the support of Congresswoman Tauscher," said Hillary Clinton. "In Congress she is a leader on many national defense and military issue, and is also a staunch advocate for working families, students and businesses."
