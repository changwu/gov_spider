    Laura and I were deeply saddened to learn of the crash this morning in central Vietnam of a helicopter carrying 16 people, including 7 U.S. military personnel, who were on an important mission to find and recover the remains of servicemen missing from the Vietnam war. The families of the service personnel lost in today's tragic accident know better than most the contribution their loved ones made in bringing closure to scores of families across America. Today's loss is a terrible one for our Nation. Although not lost in a hostile act, like those for whom they search, they too have lived lives of great consequence, answering a calling of service to their fellow citizens. As we enter a period of religious holidays across America, may we remember their sacrifice and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
