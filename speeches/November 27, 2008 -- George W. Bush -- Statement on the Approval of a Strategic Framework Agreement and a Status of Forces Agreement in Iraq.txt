    Earlier today, in another sign of progress, Iraq's Council of Representatives approved two agreements with the United States, a strategic framework agreement and a security agreement, often called a status of forces agreement or SOFA. The strategic framework agreement sets the foundation for a long-term bilateral relationship between our two countries, and the security agreement addresses our presence, activities, and withdrawal from Iraq. Today's vote affirms the growth of Iraq's democracy and increasing ability to secure itself. We look forward to a swift approval by Iraq's Presidency Council.
Two years ago, this day seemed unlikely, but the success of the surge and the courage of the Iraqi people set the conditions for these two agreements to be negotiated and approved by the Iraqi Parliament. The improved conditions on the ground and the Parliamentary approval of these two agreements serve as a testament to the Iraqi, coalition, and American men and women, both military and civilian, who paved the way for this day.
As the two agreements move to Iraq's Presidency Council for final approval, we congratulate the members of the Council of Representatives for coming together to approve these historic agreements that will serve the shared and enduring interests of both our countries and the region.
