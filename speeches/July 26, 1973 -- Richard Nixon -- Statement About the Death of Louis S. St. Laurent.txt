    THE death of Louis St. Laurent ends a long life of distinguished service to Canada and to the community of nations.
As I recall Prime Minister St. Laurent's many contributions to the structure of world peace, I think particularly of his instrumental role in the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Today NATO stands as an important monument to his leadership.
The many friends of Louis St. Laurent in the United States also remember with special gratitude and affection his tireless contributions to the cause of friendship and cooperation between our countries. Mrs. Nixon and I join in mourning his death.
