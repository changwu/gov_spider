    Today, Biden for President announced the four co-chairs of the campaign's Vice Presidential Selection Committee: former U.S. Senator Christopher J. Dodd; U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti; and former White House and Senate counsel to Vice President Biden, Cynthia C. Hogan.
"Selecting a vice presidential candidate is one of the most important decisions in a presidential campaign and no one knows this more than Joe Biden," said Jen O'Malley Dillon, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "These four co-chairs reflect the strength and diversity of our party, and will provide tremendous insight and expertise to what will be a rigorous selection and vetting process. We are grateful for their service to the campaign and for their leadership."
Vice President Biden announced on March 15, 2020 that he would choose a woman to be his running mate. The Co-Chairs of his selection process will conduct conversations across the party as well as work with a network of vetting teams led by former White House Counsel Bob Bauer, campaign General Counsel Dana Remus, and former Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco, to provide Vice President Biden with the background and information he needs to make his decision.

Former United States Senator Chris Dodd has been a longtime friend and colleague of Vice President Biden for almost forty years. Senator Dodd has earned a reputation as a leading voice on domestic and international issues during his service in the U.S. Congress. He chaired the Senate Banking Committee, where he co-authored the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Along with Vice President Biden, Dodd helped shepherd the historic Affordable Care Act through the HELP Committee as interim chair and to final passage. Senator Dodd has a long history of foreign affairs experience serving with then-Senator Biden on the Foreign Relations Committee for three decades. Senator Dodd served for almost thirty years on the Senate Children and Families committee. He considers his work on behalf of our nation's children, including such legislation as the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, to be some of the most satisfying and rewarding of his Senate career. Senator Dodd is no stranger to the importance of the upcoming election, having both served as the General Chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the reelection of Bill Clinton, and having coauthored landmark election reform legislation after the controversial 2000 election. After retiring from the Senate, Dodd served as the Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association and is currently senior counsel at the law firm of Arnold & Porter.
