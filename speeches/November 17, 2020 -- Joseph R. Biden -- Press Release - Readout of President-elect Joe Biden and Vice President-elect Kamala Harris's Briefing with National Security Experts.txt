    The president-elect and vice president-elect appreciated the opportunity to hear from some of our country's most experienced national security experts about the challenges facing our country and our institutions. The experts briefed them on the diplomatic, defense, and intelligence challenges the administration will inherit on day one, focusing on both the strategic landscape as well as the readiness of our foreign policy and national security departments and agencies. The broader Transition team will continue to hear from distinguished former practitioners, especially as the lack of GSA ascertainment prevents the Transition from meeting with and hearing from current Executive Branch officials, including on pressing matters of national security and foreign policy.
