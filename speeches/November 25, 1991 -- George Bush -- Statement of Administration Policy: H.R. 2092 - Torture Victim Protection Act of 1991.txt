    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Yatron (D) Pennsylvania and 44 others)
The Administration strongly supports the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This Convention establishes a multilateral framework for dealing with the problem of torture.
The Administration, however, opposes enactment of H.R. 2092, as reported by Committee, because it:

—   represents a unilateral extension of civil jurisdiction that is questionable under the Constitution;
—   may pose significant problems of reciprocity and retaliation by foreign countries; and
—   would direct the Judicial branch to exercise jurisdiction in a manner potentially detrimental to the Executive branch's role in the conduct of foreign relations. 
H.R. 2092 conflicts with the Convention's approach to combatting torture.
