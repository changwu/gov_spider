    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Markey (D) Massachusetts and 5 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2921.
"Junk fax" and automated telephone solicitation machines have engendered only a small number of public complaints. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the States already have adequate authority to address such complaints. H.R. 2921 calls for a nationwide list of persons who object to telephone and fax solicitations; developing and maintaining such a list would impose substantial costs and burdens on several parties. It has not been demonstrated that less drastic administrative remedies are insufficient.
