    The President has expressed his deep concern for people faced with the threat of spring flooding.
Melting snow coupled with rising temperatures and spring rains could bring floods to many parts of the country without warning. Other areas not hit by winter storms could be affected if they are in the path of flood waters.
Recently, major flooding has taken place in Nebraska, Indiana, and Ohio. Mudslides and floods have left people homeless in Southern California. The New England coast and parts of Arizona were unexpectedly flooded. Property losses amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars.
Many of these losses could have been averted if property owners had purchased flood insurance.
People living in flood-prone areas can take precautions before disaster strikes. Local insurance agents offer low-cost, federally subsidized flood insurance available through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Property owners can insure homes, businesses, and contents for as little as 25 cents per $100 coverage. Tenants can insure their personal belongings under the program.
It takes 15 days for flood insurance to take effect. Policies purchased today will cover damages if a flood hits in 2 1/2 weeks.
