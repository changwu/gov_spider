    New York Congressman Peter King today made the following statement on the recent leaks of sensitive national security information:
"David Axelrod said today that no one is more committed to ferreting out national security leakers from the White House than President Obama. If that is true, then the President should join with congressional leaders in calling for a thorough and independent investigation of these security breaches. Every time sensitive national-security information leaks from the White House or any part of the government, our soldiers, intelligence operatives, and our citizens are placed in jeopardy. President Obama must take the lead in putting an end to this threat to our security. The White House's exploitation of national security secrets for political gain must cease once and for all."
