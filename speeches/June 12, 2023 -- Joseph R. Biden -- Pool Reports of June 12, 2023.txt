In-town pool report #3: More updates
Hey all,
Another update from the White House: "Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will be joined by NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby at today's press briefing." I confirmed with the White House that the start time for this briefing is still 2:15 p.m.
For awareness, I've also put queries out on the root canal: Is the president's root canal considered an emergency procedure? What time will it take place? How long is the procedure expected to last? I will let you know if I get further information.

In-town pool report #8: briefing concludes
Won't go into too much detail here since it was streamed, but some quick notes since we did get some new information during the briefing about POTUS's root canal: Press secretary confirmed "that the procedure has been successfully completed. The president is doing just fine." She added that he will be working in the residence this afternoon. Called the root canal a "routine dental procedure" done with local anesthesia that had no broader effects.
