    Today, the country's most restrictive legislation regulating access to reproductive health care was signed into law in Oklahoma. This law makes providing an abortion illegal in the state of Oklahoma, with only a narrow exception for medical emergencies and no exception for rape or incest.
This unconstitutional attack on women's rights is just the latest and one of the most extreme state laws signed into law to date. Protecting the right recognized in Roe v. Wade continues to be a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, and we call on Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, which would shut down these attacks and codify this long-recognized, constitutional right. Make no mistake: the actions today in Oklahoma are a part of disturbing national trend attacking women's rights and the Biden Administration will continue to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures.
