    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Cranston (D) CA and five others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of its substitute bill to S. 2344. The Administration, however, will work with the Conference Committee to delete the provisions of the bill that would create a new grant program to establish medical research centers at certain State medical schools.
The Administration strongly supports medical research. In FY 1992, $227 million was appropriated to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for medical research. In addition, the National Institutes of Health (NTH) award over $5 billion annually in grants to medical schools and universities for research. Both the VA and NIH research include the types of research specified in the House version of S. 2344. In light of this substantial existing Federal commitment, the Administration opposes the new research grant authority in the House version of S. 2344. In addition, this provision would also cause the Department of Defense to divert research funds from higher priority defense bio-medical research projects.
The Administration is pleased to note that the House bill authorizes VA and community health facilities to share in the acquisition and use of major medical equipment. This promotes cost effective and sound health policy.
