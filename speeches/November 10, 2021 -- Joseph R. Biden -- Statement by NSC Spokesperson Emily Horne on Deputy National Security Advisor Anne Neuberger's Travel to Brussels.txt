    From November 8-10, Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger was in Brussels to continue the Biden Administration's work with allies and international partners to advance cybersecurity on both sides of the Atlantic, to promote responsible state behavior in cyberspace, and to work together to chart a 21st century course for cyberspace and emerging technology.
On Monday, Neuberger met with a range of EU officials and members of EU parliament to discuss cybersecurity and emerging technology policies. On Tuesday, Neuberger consulted with the North Atlantic Council at NATO on ways to enhance national and Alliance resilience in cyberspace. On behalf of the U.S., Neuberger recommended areas where NATO Allies can work, both independently and collectively, to defend against, deter, and respond to the full spectrum of cyber threats. The discussions follow NATO's adoption of a new Cyber Defense Policy, its first in seven years, strongly supported by the United States, that provides NATO Allies the strategic direction to advance a shared deterrence and defense posture in cyberspace.
Neuberger's trip builds on the Biden Administration's ongoing work to build international cooperation to tackle cyber threats. The Administration's efforts have included rallying G7 countries to hold nations who harbor ransomware criminals accountable; working with allies and partners to impose costs on nation-states for malicious cyber activity, and disrupt the ransomware ecosystem; and hosting an international counter-ransomware initiative at the White House in October with over 30 countries and the European Union, to accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware.
