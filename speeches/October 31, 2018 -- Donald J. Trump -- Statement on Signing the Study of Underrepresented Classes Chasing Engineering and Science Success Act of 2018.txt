    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 6758, the "Study of Underrepresented Classes Chasing Engineering and Science Success Act of 2018" or the "SUCCESS Act" (the "Act"). The Act extends the authority of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) within the Department of Commerce to set patent and trademark fees for 8 years. It also requires a report on patents issued to certain groups.
Section 3 of the Act would require the Director of the USPTO to submit legislative recommendations to the Congress. My Administration will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President the discretion to recommend to the Congress only "such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
