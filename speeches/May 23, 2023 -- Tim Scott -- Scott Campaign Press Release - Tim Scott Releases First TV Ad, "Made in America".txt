    "To the radical left that says we're an evil, declining country, I say the truth of MY life disproves YOUR lies."
CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott released his first TV ad today, titled "Made in America." The ad comes on the heels of Tim Scott announcing his candidacy for President of the United States on Monday in North Charleston.
This first ad is part of a more than $6 million ad buy that will air statewide starting Wednesday in Iowa and New Hampshire. This first buy also includes a substantial digital ad campaign. Tim entered the race for president with $22 million cash on hand, the most of any presidential candidate in American history.
The ad can be viewed here.


TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: "I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity.  
I was raised by a single mother in poverty. She taught me to have stubborn faith, faith in God, faith in ourselves, and faith in America. 
I rose from a child of poverty to a candidate for President of the United States because we chose patriotism over pity, and to be victors, not victims.  
Made in America – that's MY story.
That's why it pains my soul to see the Biden liberals attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. Indoctrination in our schools, Inflation in our economy, crime in our neighborhoods, victimhood in our culture. 
To the radical left that says we're an evil, declining country, I say the truth of MY life disproves YOUR lies. 
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because I have faith in America, and our president should too."
