    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Darden (D) and Lewis (D) GA)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2121. While the administration agrees that U.S. Highway 27 should be relocated out of the park, the problem is basically a State and local traffic issue. Accordingly, the relocation should be addressed and funded by the State of Georgia using either the State's allocation from the Highway Trust Fund or State and local funds.
