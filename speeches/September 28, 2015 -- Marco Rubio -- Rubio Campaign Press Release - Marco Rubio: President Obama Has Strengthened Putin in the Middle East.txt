On how he sees Russia's role in the Middle East and President Obama's failure in the region:
Here's the argument Russians are making: The United States broke the Middle East. . . . They invaded Iraq, then they left too early, and the place collapsed into chaos. And, now that they broke it, they're leaving, and they're leaving us with this mess. So we — meaning the Russians — we're going to step in and provide the leadership this region needs. And we're a much more reliable than the United States is.
This is the argument they're making to multiple countries in the region. This president has fallen into that, he's in fact strengthened Putin's hand.
If I were president, the argument would be the reverse: We would provide a clear strategy to deal with ISIS; we would have done so already. Those nations would prefer to work with us, but if left with a choice between Russia and nothing, they're going to choose Russia.
