    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Richardson (D) MN and 14 others)
While the administration supports designation of some parts of the Rio Chama as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the administration opposes H.R. 1839 because it includes several miles of the river as it flows through non-Federal property. This would expose the Federal government to an unacceptable risk of having to buy such lands if the current owners propose to develop it in a fashion that would impair the wild and scenic characteristics of the river. Such acquisition could be very costly.
