    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Rutherford, R-FL, and five cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018. The bill would expand existing Federal criminal law pertaining to certain crimes targeting law enforcement officers. By permitting the Federal prosecution of individuals who knowingly cause serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer, or attempts to do so, H.R. 5698 would help protect the courageous men and women of law enforcement who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. Individuals who commit such crimes would be subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years. The penalty would increase if the offense results in the death of a law enforcement officer or includes a kidnapping, or an attempt to kill or kidnap. The Administration stands with the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs Association, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association in recognition and appreciation of the unwavering dedication and service of law enforcement officers to the Nation and the American people.
If H.R. 5698 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
