    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senator Lugar (R) Indiana)
The Administration commends the Senate for taking rapid action to address the urgent needs for emergency food aid and disaster assistance in the drought-stricken countries of Africa. However, the total funding authorized by this bill, $175 million ($137.5 million in disaster assistance and $37.5 million for migration and refugee assistance), substantially exceeds the $25 million authorization for disaster assistance requested by the Administration.
The Administration has made a total commitment for fiscal year 1985 of over $1 billion for Africa famine assistance. For emergency food aid alone, the Administration has volunteered that the United States will provide 50 percent or 1.5 million tons of food for 1985.
Only the requested $25 million of additional authorization is needed to meet the $1 billion commitment. Accordingly, the Administration is opposed to enactment of S. 457. It provides for disaster assistance at a significantly higher authorization than is needed and can be effectively used, and provides an unnecessary authorization for refugee assistance. The Administration urges the Congress to provide only the amounts requested.
