    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am pleased to transmit my Statement of Policy for the Recommended 1990 RPA Program regarding Federal management and use of our Nation's natural resources pursuant to the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1606). Accompanying the Statement of Policy is the RPA Assessment of the Forest and Rangeland Situation in the United States, 1989, and the Secretary of Agriculture's recommended program entitled The Forest Service Program for Forest and Rangeland Resources: A Long-term Strategic Plan.
The Secretary of Agriculture's proposed program provides important guidance for the conservation and wise use of the Nation's natural resources. The proposal recommits the Forest Service to multiple-use principles, while emphasizing the importance of seeking a proper balance among resources and the commitment to a healthy environment. It is a strategy that will help to ensure a proud legacy of diverse forests and rangelands for future generations of Americans.
Sincerely,
George Bush
