    With less than one week before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples' lives and marching our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging impacts across the country—including undermining our national security and forcing servicemembers across the country and around the world to work without pay.
During an Extreme Republican Shutdown, servicemembers would continue working every day to keep our country safe, including our 1.3 million active-duty troops—but wouldn't receive their paychecks until funding becomes available. Hundreds of thousands of their civilian colleagues in the Department of Defense would also be furloughed, affecting the ways in which the Department manages its affairs globally, including the vital task of recruiting new members of the military. All of this would prove disruptive to our national security.
The reason these national security priorities are now at risk: extreme House Republicans' relentless efforts to slash funding for vital programs rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs for the American people. House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that two-third of them voted for just a few months ago and have instead proposed devastating cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on.
Below is a state-by-state breakdown of the 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers at risk of not getting paid during an Extreme Republican Shutdown:
