    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Kildee (D) MI)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 2312, which would amend the Follow Through Act and Head Start Transition Project Act. The Administration will seek an amendment in the Senate to preserve the program's emphasis on the short-term demonstration of model projects. Deleting section 1 (a) of the bill would reinstate the five-year funding limitation on such projects.
