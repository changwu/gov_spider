    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(McCollum (R) Florida and 4 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3565.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3565 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that H.R. 3565 would increase direct spending by about $1 million per year. The bill does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending. The Administration will work with the Congress to find an appropriate offset(s).
