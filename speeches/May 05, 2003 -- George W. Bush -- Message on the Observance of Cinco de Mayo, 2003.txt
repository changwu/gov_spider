    I send greetings to those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
Today, millions of people in Mexico and around the world honor the heritage of a proud people by remembering the heroic Battle of Puebla. On May 5th, 1862, Mexico's General Ignacio Zaragoza and his troops achieved a remarkable victory in the face of tremendous challenge and helped secure Mexico's freedom. This example of courage and sacrifice continues to inspire us today, as we are reminded that people of every culture, of every race, and every background, yearn to be free.
This observance also provides an opportunity for the United States to recognize the invaluable contributions of Mexican Americans to our country. Through their vibrant culture and deep commitment to faith, family, and community, Mexican Americans have enriched our society and contributed to the diversity that makes our Nation strong. We also recognize the many Mexican Americans serving in our Armed Forces who are working to bring freedom and justice to oppressed people. As we remember our two countries' shared history and common values, we look forward to a future of continued friendship and prosperity.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a memorable celebration.
