Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Mr. President, give us an update on the debt ceiling deal. Are you confident it will pass Congress?
The President. Look, you know I never say I'm confident what the Congress is going to do. But I feel very good about it. I've spoken with a number of the Members. I spoke to McConnell. I spoke to a whole bunch of people. And it feels good. We'll see when the vote starts.
And look, one of the things that I hear some of you guys saying is, "Why doesn't Biden say what a good deal it is?" Why would Biden say what a good deal it is before the vote? You think that's going to help me get it passed? No. That's why you guys don't bargain very well.
Anyway.
Turkey 
Q. Mr. President, what's your message to—-
Q. Mr. President——

Q. And what would you tell them?
The President. I'm not going to tell you.
Q. Why not?
The President. Look, you guys all get on and say, "Tell them what a good deal it is." How about—how about if this was a hundred-percent deal for the Democrats? Do you think it would help me get it passed?
Q. Well, who got the better deal?
The President. Wait—do you think it's going to help me get it passed? Come on.
Q. Mr. President, who got the better deal?
2024 Presidential Election 
Q. What do you think of the way that the 2024 Republican field is shaking out?
The President. I haven't been able to keep up with it. [Laughter] It's moving so quickly. And you know, I'm not being facetious; I'm being very serious. I haven't focused on it that much. It seems that a lot of competent candidates who are trying to get the nomination. So we'll see.

Q. Mr. President, on defense, on defense spending, some of the—some Republicans are saying that this deal does not raise—does not give the Pentagon enough money. Can you guarantee that America's fighting force is going to have what it needs for the next couple years?
The President. Look, whatever the fighting force needs, if there's another—first of all, they passed my budget, what I asked for in defense. They passed that. Obviously, if there's any existential need for additional funding, I have no doubt we'd be able to get it because we'd jointly do it.
