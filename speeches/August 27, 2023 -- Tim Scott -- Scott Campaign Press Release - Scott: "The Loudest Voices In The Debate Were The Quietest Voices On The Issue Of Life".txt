    Charleston, S.C. - Tonight, Tim Scott joined Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy on Fox News to discuss his debate performance and the importance of standing up for life.

Tim Scott: The loudest voices in the debate were the quietest voices on the issue of life. Protecting life on the federal level with a 15-week limit is in America's best interest, and it reflects our Declaration of Independence that says our Creator gave us inalienable rights, including the right to life. So if we are going to allow California, New York, and Illinois to have abortion on demand up until the day of birth, shout it from the mountaintops about issues that do not matter, and then being quiet like a church mouse on the debate stage on the issues that are relevant to our primary voters, and frankly to a party based on freedom to deny that freedom and not stand for life, as three of the candidates did on the debate stage. That's a shame, and shouting and screaming about nothing, and then being quiet about something, does not reflect the kind of leadership that will get the job done.
