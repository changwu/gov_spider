    Au revoir. I will come again.
A very warm goodby and a beautiful day, but we had a very good visit with our friends from France. Of course, we couldn't go into many matters because of the occasion, but also, it was an opportunity to see many other people from around the world. But we always like to come to Paris.
I look forward to coming back some day when I have many hours as a tourist to try the restaurants again.
Forty years ago, I majored in French, had 4 years of French. After 4 years, I could speak it, I could write it. I read all the classics. And today, I just understand a little.
BYSTANDER. When do you come back in France, Mr. President, again?
THE PRESIDENT. Any time I have a good excuse. I love it. Goodby. Merci.
