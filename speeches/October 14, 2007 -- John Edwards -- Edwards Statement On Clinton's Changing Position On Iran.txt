    Dover, New Hampshire – Senator John Edwards today released the following statement from New Hampshire regarding Senator Clinton's changing position on Iran:
"In today's New York Times, we read that some of Senator Clinton's advisors are saying that her vote on Iran was part of her moving from primary mode to general election mode. We don't need a candidate who has a primary mode and a general election mode—we need a candidate whose only mode is truth telling. That's what we need in our president too.
"There is too much at stake in this election for any voter to be forced to question the sincerity of the Democratic nominee. More importantly, after seven years of George Bush, the strongest general election candidate will be a straight shooter, not a candidate who changes what they say depending on the day."
