    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, U.S. Congressman Sam Johnson endorsed Ted Cruz for President. Johnson has represented Texas' 3rd congressional district since 1991. He is the 7th Texas Congressional endorsement Cruz has received, joining Congressman John Culberson (TX-7), Louie Gohmert (TX-1), Michael Burgess (TX-26), John Ratcliffe (TX-4), Brian Babin (TX-36), and Randy Weber (TX-14).
Johnson attended Southern Methodist University and upon graduation enlisted in the Air Force where he served for 29 years. Johnson fought in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, winning multiple medals, including two Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, one Bronze Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross. While on his 25th combat mission, Johnson took enemy fire over North Vietnam and spent nearly seven years as a Prisoner of War at the infamous "Hanoi Hilton", more than half of that time in solitary confinement. He was awarded the National Patriot Award in 2009 from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.
"It is time. We need a real conservative in the White House who is a man of principle that can help get this country back on track," said Rep. Johnson. "America needs leadership, and Ted Cruz has consistently stood up and led the fight for conservative principles like defunding Obamacare, stopping President Obama's lawless executive action, and defending life and marriage. During this time in our world, we need someone who is prepared to be Commander-in-Chief in order to protect Americans at home and abroad."
"Sam is a man of principle and great courage," said Cruz. "He is a leader in the state of Texas and has served Texans well in Congress and served our country dutifully and honorably as a Colonel in the Air Force. Sam understands the dire need to restore America's leadership in the world during the time when the failed polices of President Obama are putting Americans in danger. I am honored to have his support."
