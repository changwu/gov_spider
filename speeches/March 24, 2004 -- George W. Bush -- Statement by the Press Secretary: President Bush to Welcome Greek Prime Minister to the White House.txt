    President Bush will welcome Greek Prime Minister Konstandinos Karamanlis to the White House on May 20, 2004. This visit will provide an opportunity to deepen our partnership with Greece in pursuit of democracy, prosperity, and peace in southeastern Europe and the Greater Middle East. The leaders will also discuss final preparations for a successful and safe Olympics in Athens, as the Summer Games return to the land of their birth this August.
