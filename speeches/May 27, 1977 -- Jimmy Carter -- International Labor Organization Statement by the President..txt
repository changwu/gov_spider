    The question of U.S. relations with the ILO remains a matter of high priority and will remain under continuing review by a Cabinet-level committee where, we hope, the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce will continue to play active roles.
Because of dissatisfaction in the U.S. Government and among labor and industry leaders with a number of unfortunate trends in the ILO, the United States submitted a letter on November 5, 1975, giving the required 2-year notice of intent to withdraw from the organization. In that letter, it was stated:
"The U.S. does not desire to leave the ILO. The U.S. does not expect to do so. But we do intend to make every possible effort to promote the conditions which will facilitate our continued participation. If this should prove impossible, we are in fact prepared to depart."
Those views are no less valid today. They will guide our actions and our ultimate derision in the critical months ahead.
