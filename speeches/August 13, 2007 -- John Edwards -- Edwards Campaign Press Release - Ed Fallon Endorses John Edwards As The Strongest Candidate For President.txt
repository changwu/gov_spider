    Des Moines, Iowa – The John Edwards for President campaign today announced that former Iowa gubernatorial candidate and state representative Ed Fallon has endorsed Senator John Edwards in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
"John Edwards is the only candidate who has offered progressive solutions on everything from universal health care to solving the global climate crisis," Fallon said. "He has been a strong and clear voice on ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home. He also has the backbone to stand up to the big corporations and the courage to tackle problems that other politicians simply ignore – like ending poverty in America. John Edwards can and will lead our party to victory in November 2008."
"I am honored to have Ed Fallon's support," Edwards said. "As a leading progressive voice in the Democratic Party, Ed understands the needs of Iowans, and I look forward to working with him in Iowa to build support for an agenda of bold change."
Fallon was a Democratic candidate for Governor of Iowa in 2006 and served as a member of the Iowa General Assembly from 1993 to 2006. A graduate of Drake University, Fallon is a former organizer for Iowa Citizen Action Network and founder of the Clarion Alliance, a non-profit focusing on peace and conflict resolution issues. Fallon is also a co-founder of "1000 Friends of Iowa," a non-profit focused on responsible land use and community development.
In 1992, Fallon won election to the Iowa House and over the next 14 years he earned a reputation as a progressive legislator with a keen interest in his constituents' needs and a commitment to campaign finance reform, universal health care and ending poverty. After leaving office, Fallon co-founded "Independence Movement for Iowa," or "I'M for Iowa," a grassroots statewide organization seeking to support local businesses, family farmers and progressive candidates for office.
