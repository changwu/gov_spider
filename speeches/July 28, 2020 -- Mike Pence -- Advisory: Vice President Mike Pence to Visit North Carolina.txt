    On Wednesday, July 29th, Vice President Pence will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina. There, the Vice President will visit Thales Academy, which dedicated over 40,000 working hours focused on safely reopening the school to students. On July 20th, the Academy reopened to over 300 students, allowing them to return to campus. The Vice President will participate in a roundtable to discuss the plan Thales Academy is using to safely open.
Following, the Vice President will tour NCBiotech which is conducting Phase-III trials for a Coronavirus vaccine. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration made it a priority to remove unnecessary barriers and red tape to allow Coronavirus vaccine trials to be expedited, while ensuring the same standards of safety and effectiveness. The Vice President will discuss President Trump's goal of making a Coronavirus vaccine available to the American people as soon and as safely as possible.
Later that evening, the Vice President will return to Washington D.C.
Additional details about the Vice President's trip are forthcoming.
