    President Reagan profoundly deplores the cowardly assassination of Turkish Honorary Consul General Orhan Gunduz in Massachusetts last night. He has directed Federal law enforcement agencies to take every appropriate measure in cooperation with local authorities in Massachusetts to apprehend those responsible for this vicious act.
The President is determined that the U.S. Government will provide no quarter for individuals or organizations engaged in terrorist activity. The Government and people of Turkey are our friends, and we join with them in mourning the loss of Consul General Gunduz and in condemning those responsible for his death.
