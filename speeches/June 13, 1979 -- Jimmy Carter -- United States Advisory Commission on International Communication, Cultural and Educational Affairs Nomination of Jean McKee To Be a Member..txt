She was also active in a number of Republican political campaigns between 1952 and 1962.
From 1962 to 1966, McKee was a partner and treasurer of a public relations and public opinion polling firm, Consensus, Inc., leaving the firm in 1964 to work on then-Governor Nelson Rockefeller's national campaign committee and the New York Republican State Committee, and in 1965 to work on former Senator Kenneth Keating's campaign for judge of the court of appeals.
In 1966 McKee worked for the New York Republican State Committee and the Republican State campaign committee. In 1967 she joined the staff of Senator Jacob K. Javits. She worked in his New York and Washington offices until 1975, and was named administrative assistant in 1973.
In 1976 and 1977, McKee served as Deputy Administrator, then Acting Administrator, of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. She was chief of staff to Minority Leader Duryea and operations director of his campaign during 1978.
