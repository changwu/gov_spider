    Oleson represents the second-most populous county in Iowa and has many Republican, civic affiliations
ANKENY, Iowa — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that Linn County Supervisor Brent Oleson has endorsed Ron Paul for the presidency.
Attracted to Congressman Paul's commitment, character, and courage Mr. Oleson said, "Ron Paul has the principals and conviction necessary to solve our national budget woes. With our national debt over $14 trillion, the spending by Washington D.C. continues to mortgage the fruits of our labor to fund programs we don't need and can't afford. Ron Paul puts people before politics and will work to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a strong economy and prosperous nation, not one saddled by debt."
Brent Oleson is an attorney residing in Marion, Iowa with his two children. For many years, he has been an active participant in Iowa politics — serving two terms on the Republican Party of Iowa's State Central Committee, six terms on the Linn County Central Committee, and as a Republican Party of Iowa Platform Committee Member.
Representing Iowa's second-most populous county of 211,000 residents, Oleson was elected to his district with over 58 percent of the vote in the heavily Democratic county. Mr. Oleson also serves on the boards of the Linn County Republican Party, Eagles Club, Linn County Solid Waste Agency, Marion Economic Development Corporation, Cedar Valley Humane Society, and Trees Forever.
"We're pleased to count Brent Oleson's endorsement among the many ones that will help our campaign achieve a strong top-three showing in January," Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers said of the upcoming caucus.
