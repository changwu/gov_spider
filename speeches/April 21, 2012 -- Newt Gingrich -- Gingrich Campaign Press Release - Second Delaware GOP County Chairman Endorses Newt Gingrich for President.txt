    Dover, DE - Newt 2012 announced today that Jerry Wood, Chairman of the Sussex County Republican Party is formally endorsing Newt Gingrich. Wood is the second Delaware GOP County Chairman to announce his support for Gingrich in the past 24 hours.
"Delaware will not be marginalized and will not be taken for granted," said Wood. "Newt Gingrich is the only candidate who has taken the time to campaign in every part of the First State. Furthermore, he has persuasively made the case that his detailed plans for jump starting the economy with bold tax reform, returning to a balanced budget, and an energy strategy to return gasoline to $2.50 per gallon are the right direction for America. This Tuesday, I will proudly vote for Newt Gingrich over Mitt Romney and encourage my fellow Sussex County Republicans to do the same."
"Jerry is a fierce advocate for his fellow Delawareans and a dedicated Republican activist. I am proud that he has decided to join our team," said Newt Gingrich. "I look forward to working with Jerry to share our positive message of bold, conservative breakthroughs across the state of Delaware ahead of Tuesday's primary."
Yesterday, Newt 2012 also announced that Hans Reigle, Chairman of the Kent County Republican Party, was switching his support from Mitt Romney to Newt Gingrich. Reigle has also served as the Mayor of Wyoming, Delaware and served for over 20 years in the United States Air Force.
Gingrich is campaigning in Delaware this week in advance of the state's April 24th primary.
