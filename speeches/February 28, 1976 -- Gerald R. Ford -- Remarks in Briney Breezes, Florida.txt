    Mr. Mayor and all of the wonderful people here at Briney Breezes:
We have made about 10 stops since we arrived in Florida this morning, and it seems like every one of them gets more enthusiastic and more--you know just warm, and the welcome and the weather is getting better, too.. [Laughter]
What I really appreciate is the friendliness--the indication of understanding and support. And it's great to see people from Cedar Springs, my old "red flannel town," and Kent City. They are all wonderful people. But I ran into about five people who said they were from New Hampshire. And every one of them said they voted for me, and I appreciate it very much.
I think they made a good investment because what we are trying to do, to be serious for a minute, is to take this country out of the problems we have had for the last 19 months, and we have had them at home--you know as well as I. But by doing the right thing and staying a steady course, being tough with the Congress and doing what is right, America is on the right path again.
And let me assure you that we are going to have a strong, firm, wise policy in meeting our adversaries abroad, in strengthening our relations with our friends. Freedom is dependent upon the strength of America, and the United States is going to be second to none in strength in dealing with either friends or adversaries.
Well I can't shake hands with everybody, but I will do it figuratively, if not literally. I appreciate every one of you coming out here. It has been a great experience, a wonderful opportunity for me to see some old friends and make some new acquaintances.
As I close, I would like to ask something of you. I hope what we have done to keep America strong at home and strong abroad has met with your approval. If it has, I ask that you help me on March 9. After we win on March 9, we are going to win in November--November 2.
Thank you very, very much.
