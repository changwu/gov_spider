    SUMMER VACATION PLANS
THE PRESIDENT. I have questions from time to time about what I propose to do for the summer. I haven't been able to reply to them because I haven't been able to give it any consideration.
I have been very much urged by the National Park Service to visit the Rocky Mountain parks: Glacier, Yellowstone, Estes, and the other parks. Those are the national playgrounds, and they are certainly beautiful enough to accommodate presidents, and if it can be arranged I propose to make a trip beginning at the northern ones and working down the Rocky Mountain section through the different parks, during the month of August, staying here in Washington during the early part of the summer, taking weekends up in the Shenandoah hills.
That I would rather not have for direct quotations. That is for your own information. Many of you will be condemned to go along on trips like that, and you may like to know in advance what will happen to you.
Q. Will there be a couple of press cars to your train, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. I would hope that this can be done after the arrival in the region by automobile rather than by train and in short stages.
