    
This is why elections matter.
President Obama just made an emotional call to stop gun violence in America—and backed it up by announcing executive actions intended to curb the epidemic of violence that's taking more than 33,000 American lives every year.
These are important steps that will respect the Second Amendment while working to protect our families and communities from gun violence. But there's more we have to do—and it's going to require all of us to stand up and say, "Enough."
That means demanding more from our elected officials.


  "All of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies." —@POTUS #StopGunViolence— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 5, 2016

That means standing up to the gun lobby.


  The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities.— President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016

And that means voting. If you want to defend President Obama's actions to help prevent gun violence from taking more American lives, you have to vote in this election—because the Republicans running for president would rip away these executive actions and the progress we've made.


  "We need voters who want safer gun laws, and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in the way, to remember come election time." —@POTUS— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 5, 2016


  Thank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress—not rip it away. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 5, 2016
