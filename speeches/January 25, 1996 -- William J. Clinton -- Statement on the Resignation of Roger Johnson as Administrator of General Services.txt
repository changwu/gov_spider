    I learned of Roger Johnson's resignation as Administrator of the General Services Administration with deep regret. He served his country with distinction over the last 3 years, bringing a common-sense approach and let's-get-downto-business style to the GSA.
He worked closely with the Vice President and the staff of the National Performance Review to implement real reforms at the GSA. Because of his work, today's GSA provides better service with a smaller bureaucracy and lower operating costs. We will continue to build on the work Roger started.
At a time when all Americans need to come together and confront our common challenges, we need people like Roger Johnson—a longtime Republican, a business leader—more than ever. Even as he leaves the Government, I hope public servants everywhere remember his example: to put partisan differences aside and work for the common good.
Hillary and I wish Roger and Janice nothing but the best as they return to California. I am deeply gratified by his kind words and look forward to working with Roger in the months ahead.
