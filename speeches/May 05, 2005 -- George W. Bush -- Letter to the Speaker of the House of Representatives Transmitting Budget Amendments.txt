    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and the Treasury; and the United States-Canada Alaska Rail Commission. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2006 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
This transmittal also contains FY 2006 budget amendments and an FY 2005 proposal for the legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of the legislative branch are commonly transmitted without change.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
