Marco on the media's misinformation about his personal finances:

I think it's absurd — Mitt Romney was too rich to be president, but I'm not rich enough? That's silly. The truth is, my finances especially — maybe not anymore, but certainly the first 10, 15 years of my marriage — looked a lot more like the people I represent than the people I serve with.
And so, instead of looking at that, and understanding why that makes me so passionate about the issues facing the American people, they focus on, why didn't I follow the advice of some financial adviser who analyzed my finances and thought I should have done this instead of that.
The truth is I've invested everything we've made into my children: All four of them have their college paid off for the first four years, so they don't have to take out student loans. Today the only debt I have is my home in Miami, which is four blocks from the house that I grew up in. That's the true analysis. . . . The media's not just driven by bias, it's also driven by conflict. They want there to be scandal or a story and sometimes they make mountains out of molehills.
