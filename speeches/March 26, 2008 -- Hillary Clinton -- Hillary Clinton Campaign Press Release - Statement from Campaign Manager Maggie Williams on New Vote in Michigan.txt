    In the wake of today's court ruling regarding Michigan's January 15th primary, we urge Senator Obama to join our call for a party-run primary and demonstrate his commitment to counting Michigan's votes.
Senator Clinton has consistently urged that the 600,000 votes cast by the people of Michigan be counted and if that is not possible, that a new election be held.
Michigan voters must not be disenfranchised and the Obama campaign must not continue to block Michigan's efforts to hold a new vote. Rather it should move quickly to announce its support for a party run primary.
Michigan will be a key battleground state in November. Disenfranchising Michigan voters today will, in the heat of a general election, provide Senator McCain with a powerful argument to use against the Democratic nominee. We cannot allow this to happen.
The people of Michigan must be counted and their voices finally heard. What the people of Michigan need now is just action, not just words.
