    At the invitation of Prime Minister Trudeau and the Government of Canada, Vice President Mondale will pay an official visit to Canada on January 18-19, 1978.
I have asked the Vice President to serve as my personal representative during this visit, which marks a welcome continuation of high-level U.S.-Canadian consultations begun at the outset of my administration with Prime Minister Trudeau's visit to Washington. Canada is one of our very closest friends, allies, and trading partners. The breadth of our bilateral and multilateral interests is great. The Vice President's visit will ensure that with our friends in Canada we continue to address those interests with the greatest possible cooperation and effectiveness.
