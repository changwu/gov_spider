    As a Representative of the people of New York in the U.S. Congress, Carolyn McCarthy has earned a reputation for principled and compassionate leadership. In particular, she's been at the forefront of the issue that brought her to Washington 17 years ago: reducing and preventing gun violence. She was also instrumental in the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act to prevent future financial crises and has been a leading advocate for improving education, especially college affordability. Like many across the Nation, Michelle and I admire Carolyn's determination and personal strength. We thank her for her service and send her and her family our warmest regards.
