    Fourth-generation Iowan is veteran of numerous campaigns in the state
The Clinton presidential campaign announced today that veteran Iowa operative JoDee Winterhof will run its state operation. Winterhof, a fourth-generation Iowan, served as Sen. Tom Harkin's chief-of-staff from 1999-2003, and worked on his presidential and senatorial campaigns.
"I am joining this effort because we need a new direction and new leadership in this country. Hillary Clinton has the experience and vision to lead this country from the moment she steps into office," Winterhof said today. "I grew up in Walnut, Iowa and love nothing more than introducing someone to more people and places across this great state. Senator Clinton is looking forward to many conversations with Iowans over the coming months and I am honored to have this opportunity to join her in this effort.
"I'm thrilled that JoDee has agreed to run my campaign in Iowa," Senator Clinton said. "She's a great organizer who clearly loves her home state, and will be a great asset to my team."
In addition to her work for Senator Harkin and other campaigns in Iowa, Winterhof served as the first Political Director of America Coming Together (ACT) during the 2004 election cycle, executing the largest progressive voter mobilization in history. She will take a leave as a principal at Grassroots Solutions, a firm that specializes in grassroots advocacy, political field consulting, training, and targeting.
Before that, Winterhof was the National Project Director for The White House Project, a non-partisan public education campaign working to see women at the highest levels of leadership in the country and served in the political operation of EMILY's List. Additionally, she served as a political appointee in the Clinton-Gore administration at the National Women's Business Council.
Winterhof grew up in Walnut, Iowa and received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Simpson College.
