    THE PRESIDENT. First of all, ever since I've been in office, since early 1977, we have worked almost day and night to solve the differences between Greece and Turkey, so that Greece could be reintegrated into NATO. And with the noble commitment of our Nation, I'm very pleased that Bernie Rogers, who is working, as you know, not as a representative of me directly but for the NATO alliance, was able to help work out an agreement by which the NATO leaders this morning voted unanimously to confirm Greece's commitment to NATO.
GROUP MEMBER. Greece back to NATO!
THE PRESIDENT. This is not only a great day for Greece and for the other European nations; it's also a great day for the United States of America. And I might say this is one of the most gratifying experiences of my time as President. Now, the next step, to which I am deeply committed, along with Fritz Mondale, as you well know, and all of my administration, is to resolve the question in Cyprus and to restore human rights. I need your help now.
