    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. hosted 'Team Trump Online! Triggered' featuring Donald Trump Jr. and UFC Fighter Colby Covington.
Donald Trump Jr. and Colby Covington discussed how celebrities and professional athletes continue to bow down to the "woke mob" and support their extremist beliefs, all in an effort to promote their personal agendas. As Joe Biden and the Democrat party carry out their political stunt of instilling fear in the American people, President Trump and the silent majority are stronger than ever. Both participants condemned the 'defund the police movement' and highlighted President Trump's commitment to stand with law enforcement officers as they put their lives on the line each and every day to keep the American people safe. As a UFC athlete, Colby Covington recognizes a strong fighter when he sees one, and expressed his complete confidence in the President's diligent efforts to defend this nation's basic freedoms and push his America First agenda.

"Joe Biden has become a trojan horse for the socialist Democrat Party's mission to oppress the American people and destroy this country." said Donald Trump Jr. "President Trump has adamantly condemned their deranged 'defund the police' movement and will always put the safety of the American people first."
"The 'woke mob' doesn't care about the American people, they care about silencing voices that dare to speak out against their agenda and support President Trump," said Colby Covington, UFC Fighter. "This country needs four more years of President Trump so he can continue his fight to drain the swamp and Make America Great Again."
