    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Edwards (D) California)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2583. There are no plans for additional land acquisition at the refuge, so authorizing additional appropriations for that purpose is unnecessary. Nearly 90 percent of the land included in the refuge is already in Federal ownership, and there are no apparent threats to the wildlife habitat on the remaining private land. Since the refuge provides significant local recreational and tourism benefits, it would be appropriate for State and local jurisdictions to fund further land acquisition if they deem such acquisition desirable.
