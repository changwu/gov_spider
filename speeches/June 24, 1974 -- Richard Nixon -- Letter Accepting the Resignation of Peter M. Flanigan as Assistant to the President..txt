    Dear Peter:
It is with the deepest regret and a personal sense of sadness that I accept your resignation as Assistant to the President and Executive Director of the Council on International Economic Policy, effective on a date to be determined.
While I have long known of your intention to return to private life, nevertheless, I am always reluctant to see so valued a friend and associate depart. You know of my profound admiration for your splendid achievements over the past five years, and I shall not dwell on them at length. Let me say, however, that of the many men and women who have served our Administration, few can match--and none exceed--the exceptional skills, energy and dedication you brought to your duties.
Through our early association in the campaigns, your work from 1969 to 1971 in the domestic field and, still more recently in the area of international economics and trade, I have always had full confidence in your abilities to deal with complex problems with immense effectiveness and unfailingly good judgement. It is with a particular sense of satisfaction that I recall the key roles you have played in such diverse areas as the transition from the draft to an all-volunteer armed forces, and the progress we have made toward reform of the international economic system. Throughout, we have shared a common commitment to a strong and prosperous America in a world at peace, and it has been a constant source of reassurance to me to have your assistance and productive support in these efforts. I shall always treasure your loyal friendship and your superb service to our Party, this Administration and to our Nation.
As you depart, I want you to know how much I appreciate your offer to devote part of your time in the future to public service. You may be certain we will take advantage of your generosity. Pat joins with me in extending to Brigid and you our heartfelt good wishes for every success and happiness in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
