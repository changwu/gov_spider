MONTPELIER - We support Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee for president because she has the experience, conviction and ability to change the direction our country has been heading.
Senator Clinton has presented a plan to lower the cost of health care for all Americans. Her plan promotes prevention and chronic care management. It is paid for through premiums based on ability to pay, administrative efficiency, and ending irresponsible tax cuts. It is built on a platform of shared responsibility for large employers and tax credits for individuals and small employers.
Hillary Clinton understands that global climate change presents an enormous challenge, but it also presents opportunities for economic development. She proposed ways to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050, to develop renewable energy and deploy energy efficiency. She would end unnecessary tax breaks for oil companies. Senator Clinton is committed to getting America out of the war in Iraq, beginning right away. Her plans provide for the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq and most importantly a new and intensive diplomatic emphasis in the region.
