Jaime Herrera Beutler, the 37-year old Congresswoman from southwest Washington State, endorsed Marco today, citing his plan to prepare our economy for the next century.

"I am proud to endorse Marco Rubio as he will focus on strengthening our economy and creating jobs. Marco understands that preparing the workforce for the changing economy continues to be a primary focus in the Pacific Northwest and across our country."
Herrera Beutler was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, making her one of the youngest conservative women in Congress.
A profile earlier this year in Marie Claire called her a "Republican spitfire" and highlighted her conservative record and the powerful story of the birth of her daughter, who battled the odds and won, despite a difficult health condition identified before birth.Congresswoman Herrera Beutler, welcome to Team Marco!
