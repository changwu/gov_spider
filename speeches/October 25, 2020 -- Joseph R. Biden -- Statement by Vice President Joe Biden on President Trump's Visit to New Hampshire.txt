    President Trump's failure to act on COVID-19 has resulted in 471 lives lost in New Hampshire, more than 10,000 Granite Staters infected, hundreds of small businesses permanently closed, and thousands of workers out of jobs. New Hampshire families deserve better than a President who, in the middle of a deadly pandemic, is working to dismantle the Affordable Care Act that provides critical protections to over 570,000 Granite Staters. And they deserve better than President Trump's attempts to divide our nation and distract us from the fact that he has no plan to protect us.
Election Day is just nine days away, and New Hampshire is ready to vote for change. As President, I will unite our nation so that together, we can beat this virus, expand access to health care and lower health care costs, and build our economy back better than before.
