MARK ALLAN, WDTN-TV (NBC-Dayton): "And there are now less than 100 days until the November election. And today former Minnesota Governor and Vice Presidential contender Tim Pawlenty was here in the Oregon district drumming up support for Mitt Romney. Jackie Sprague [is] live with more in this Decision 2012 update."
JACKIE SPRAGUE, WDTN-TV (NBC-Dayton): "We did build it. That was former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's message to supporters this afternoon at the Dublin Pub on Wayne Avenue. He says President Obama doesn't credit entrepreneurs for building their own businesses. However, the President says his words were taken out of context. Several small business owners came to the campaign stop. Pawlenty says they are the backbone of the economy and need to get the government off their backs, and Mitt Romney is just the man to do that."
TIM PAWLENTY: "He wants 20 percent across the board tax cuts for individuals and small businesses. He wants to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better, that's more consumer and market oriented."
SPRAGUE: "Pawlenty also made a plea to the crowd to help with Romney's campaign by putting up signs, making calls, talking to neighbors and raising money. After this campaign stop, Pawlenty headed to Springfield to officially open up the Clark County headquarters. Jackie Sprague, 2 News."
