I am transmitting to you the 18th annual report on employment and occupational requirements, resources, uses, and training, as required by section 127 (a) of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973, as amended. This report features a discussion of the serious unemployment problems experienced by many youth today, especially minority teenagers, and summarizes the Administration's proposals for a youth education, training, and employment initiative for the 1980's.
Also included in this volume are a report on services for veterans, as required by the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act; a report from the Secretary of Health and Human Services on cooperative program linkages with CETA programs, as required by section 127(b) of the 1978 CETA Amendments; a review of recently completed research and evaluation findings concerning employment and training programs, as required by section 313 (d) and (e) of CETA; a number of additional reports responding to requirements in the amended CETA and the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978; and a statistical appendix, containing information about the labor force and employment and training programs.
