    President Trump. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Lee of Singapore with us and his representatives at the highest level.
We've just signed an order with Boeing for almost $14 billion worth of airplanes. We do a lot of business with Singapore. The relationship now is at its highest point, and it will continue. It will continue.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. It's an honor to have you in the White House.
Prime Minister Lee. Well, thank you very much for inviting me and my delegation. We have a very good relationship with the United States, and we hope to take it forward further.
President Trump. Thank you.
Prime Minister Lee. And I'm very happy at the deal between SIA and Boeing. SIA is not a bad airline—[laughter]——
President Trump. It's a great airline.
Prime Minister Lee. ——and they try their best to buy the best airplanes, and I'm quite sure they've made a good decision.
President Trump. That's because they buy Boeing, right? [Laughter]
That's great. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
