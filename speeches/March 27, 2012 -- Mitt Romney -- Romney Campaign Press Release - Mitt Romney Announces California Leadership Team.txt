    Mitt Romney today announced his California Leadership Team.
"It is an honor to have so much support from such distinguished leaders in California," said Mitt Romney. "This is further proof that my pro-growth message is resonating with voters and that Californians want a conservative businessman to replace President Obama. I look forward to their counsel in my efforts to bring back jobs and restore fiscal sanity in Washington."
Announcing Mitt Romney's California Leadership Team, former Governor and Romney California Honorary Co-Chairman Pete Wilson said, "This election is too important for our party to nominate a candidate without the real-world economic experience and proven track record that Mitt Romney has demonstrated throughout this campaign and throughout his life. The members of his California Leadership Team have already been hard at work spreading his pro-growth message and working to ensure that President Obama is defeated in November. I am proud to be a part of this team and encourage my fellow Republicans to unite behind the one candidate we know can beat President Obama and create an economic climate that will bring jobs back to California."
