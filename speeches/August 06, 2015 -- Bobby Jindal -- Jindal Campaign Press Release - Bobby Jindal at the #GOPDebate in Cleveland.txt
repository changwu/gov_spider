On Medicaid expansion and the danger of owing so much debt to China:
"This isn't free money. I know some people like to say, 'well, this is free money.'... We are borrowing money from China today ... the President stunningly admitted this: He said, 'We don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government.' The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C."

On immigration:
"We must insist on assimilation â€” immigration without assimilation is an invasion. We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally. They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work."

On Planned Parenthood:
"Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood. This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation."
