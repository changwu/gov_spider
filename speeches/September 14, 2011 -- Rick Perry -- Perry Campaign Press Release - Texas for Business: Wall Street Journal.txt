Gov. Perry has made job creation a top priority while governor of Texas. By keeping taxes low, keeping regulations predictable, balancing state budgets without raising taxes, and passing sweeping lawsuit reform, Texas continues to allow job creators to let the private sector grow-even while the nation faces tough economic times.
Good news for GOP presidential candidate and Texas Gov. Rick Perry: His state has once again been voted the best place to do business, according to a survey to be released Monday by the DCI International.
