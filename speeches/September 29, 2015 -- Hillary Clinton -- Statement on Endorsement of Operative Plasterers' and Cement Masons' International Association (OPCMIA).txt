    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association (OPCMIA) endorsed her campaign for President. The Carpenters and Joiners follow the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, the American Federation of Teachers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers, and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry in backing Clinton.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association.
"For more than a century, the members of the OPCMIA have helped build and decorate the bridges, skyscrapers, and storefronts we all use every dayâ€”and along the way, they have helped build a stronger and more prosperous America, creating the good-paying jobs that help families get ahead and stay ahead.
"I've stood with organized labor throughout my career, and I was honored to earn the endorsement of the OPCMIA in 2008. As President, I will fight to defend workers' right to organize and unions' right to bargain collectively. I will fight to raise incomes for hardworking Americans and to ensure that people can retire with dignity and security. We have to make sure that every family in America doesn't just survive, but thrives. I'm thrilled to stand again with the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' union to support working families and grow our economy. Their fights are my fights."
