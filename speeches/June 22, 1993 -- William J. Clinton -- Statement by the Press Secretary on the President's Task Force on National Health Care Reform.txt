    The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled today that the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform, chaired by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Court of Appeals decision confirms that the task force operated in full compliance with the law.
In reversing the United States district court on this issue, the court of appeals held that Mrs. Clinton is a "full-time officer or employee of the Government" for purposes of the advisory committee act. The court of appeals decision means that the advisory committee act's requirements for open meetings and production of documents did not apply to the task force.
The President announced the creation of the health care task force, as well as interdepartmental working groups, on January 25, 1993. The task force held over 20 meetings in April and May and has presented health care reform proposals and options to the President. The President is now in the process of reviewing those proposals and options and will be preparing a final proposal for delivery to Congress.
The task force terminated on May 30, 1993. There are no plans to reconvene the task force.
