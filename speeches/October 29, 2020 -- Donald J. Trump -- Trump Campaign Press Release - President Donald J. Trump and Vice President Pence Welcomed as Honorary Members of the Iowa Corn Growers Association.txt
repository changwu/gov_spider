    In honor of the Trump Administration's strong defense of America's farmers and ethanol industry, the Iowa Corn Growers Association has announced that President Donald J. Trump is the first sitting president to ever be named an honorary member of their association. Vice President Pence has also been named a member, and accepted the honor today in Des Moines, Iowa. In a letter to the President and letter to the Vice President, the Iowa Corn Growers Association celebrated the Trump Administration's actions to protect Iowa farmers, including relief from this summer's derecho storms and protection from Chinese tariffs:
"We appreciate the time you took to come to Iowa to see the horrific damage done to our farmers by the derecho storm that hit our state this summer. Corn is a vital part of America's food and fuel security and the COVID-19 pandemic only highlighted how essential America's farmers are to the strength of the United States. Thank you once again for being the first ever sitting President of the United States to join and support Iowa's corn farmers and for that matter all corn farmers throughout the nation"
