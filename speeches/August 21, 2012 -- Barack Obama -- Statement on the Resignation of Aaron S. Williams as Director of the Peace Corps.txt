    From working tirelessly to improve volunteer support to his leadership in reforming and modernizing the agency, Aaron has been a champion of the thousands of remarkable Peace Corps volunteers serving across the globe. I know the positive change that Peace Corps volunteers make, and under Aaron's leadership, the agency's work has been at the forefront of this administration's efforts to increase global engagement. I want to extend my thanks to him for his dedicated service and wish him and his family the best.
