Hillary Clinton's disastrous foreign policy decisions have made America weaker, and Marco's not afraid to say it.
Hillary's "experience" is merely experience making the wrong decisions, Marco said this morning on Fox & Friends.

Brian Kilmeade: If you are looking for someone with experience to handle this, isn't the word experience best associated with Hillary Clinton?
Marco: Yeah, but experience of doing the wrong thing. Hillary Clinton is the architect of leading from behind. And that's what's led to this mess. You know, first of all, we have a president who believes that America is an arrogant, global power that needs to be cut down to size. That's how you get a foreign policy where we betray our allies and we cut deals with our enemies and we weaken the U.S. military, and the president apologizes, especially in the Middle East, for the United States of America, at least on ten separate occasions.
So that's where you get a Saudi Arabia, which is a military ally of the United States, feeling vulnerable. Because we cut a deal with Iran that is their Shia enemy and their mortal enemy, really, in many cases, in regards to this. You have the U.S. leading from behind, getting out of Iraq too early, leaving a space for ISIS to fill in. Same thing now happening in Afghanistan. And Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State over much of these decisions â€” when these decisions were being made.
Both she and President Obama are a complete and total disaster on their foreign policy.

There's a reason why Hillary Clinton is afraid of running against Marco: Hillary Clinton leads from behind. Marco Rubio will lead, period.
