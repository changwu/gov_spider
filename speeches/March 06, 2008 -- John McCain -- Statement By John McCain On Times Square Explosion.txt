    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released the following statement by John McCain on the attempted attack on a Times Square recruiting station:
"The attempted attack that happened in New York City this morning when someone tried to harm a recruiting station in Times Square is unacceptable in America. I know Mayor Bloomberg as well as other law enforcement agencies are actively working, and I have been assured a full investigation is taking place and hope they bring the individuals to justice as quickly as possible. We cannot allow this to happen to the men and women serving in our military whether they are at home or abroad."
