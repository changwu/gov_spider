    President Jacobi, and all of the wonder people connected with Interlochen:
Let me thank all of you on behalf of Betty and myself. I don't know who made the selections on the program, but everything on the list was on my list of favorites, and I thank you.
May I congratulate again, on Betty's and my behalf, the superb young people in the band, the orchestra, the chorus. It makes all of us extremely proud to see young people with such enthusiasm and talent and dedication.
As I sat back there, I couldn't help but be impressed to see the words that are on the back of the stage, "Dedicated to the promotion of world friendship through the universal language of the arts."
That is a hallmark; that is something all of us should strive for and seek. And all of you who participate, whether it is in the summer or year round, make a giant contribution to a better world through the spoken word of the arts.
Thank you very, very much.
