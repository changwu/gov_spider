    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 1525 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1985, I am submitting the attached report detailing actions taken by the United States Government in pursuit of our national goal of returning any servicemen who may still be held captive in Southeast Asia; the fullest possible accounting of those still missing; and the repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our Nation.
In doing so, I would like to reemphasize my personal dedication to this great national effort and my confidence that the actions of those involved throughout the Executive branch of Government in the resolution of this issue reflect this same dedication. In this effort, there can be no partisan or parochial views or any special interests, but only the interest of the entire American people to see to it that all of us do our duty toward those who served this Nation so well in time of war and their families who look to us to help secure the answers they so rightfully seek and deserve.
