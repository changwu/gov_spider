    Secretary-General Waldheim has announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry to go to Iran to hear Iran's grievances and to allow an early solution of the crisis between Iran and the United States. He has stated that the commission will speak with each of our people.
Both the United States and Iran have concurred in the establishment of the commission, as proposed by the Secretary-General, in mutually acceptable, official responses to him.
In concurring, the United States has taken note of the Secretary-General's statement that the commission will undertake a factfinding mission. It will not be a tribunal. The United States understands that the commission will hear the grievances of both sides and will report to the Secretary-General.
The American people are deeply aggrieved that Iran, after guaranteeing the protection of our people, has taken them hostage and held them in intolerable conditions for 108 days. The United States has no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of Iran, but it does insist on the prompt return of the 53 Americans now illegally held in Tehran.
The United States has also made clear its position that the meeting of the commission with our people must be consistent with international law and that the hostages must, under no circumstances, be subjected to interrogation. It is vital, how. ever, for the commission to determine that they are all present and to assess their condition.
We hope that the commission will, as the Secretary-General has said, achieve an early resolution of the crisis between our two countries, which requires the release of the hostages.
