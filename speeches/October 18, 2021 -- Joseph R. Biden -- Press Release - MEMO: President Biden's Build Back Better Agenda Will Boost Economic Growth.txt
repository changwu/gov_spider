    Today, the White House released a memo detailing the many ways President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda will grow the economy. Thanks to the President's American Rescue Plan, the U.S. is projected to grow faster than any other Major Seven economy next year. Building on the that progress, the Build Back Better Agenda boosts economic growth with investments child care, education, paid family and medical leave, home care, affordable housing, and clean energy. These policies, coupled with tax cuts for the middle class, will increase labor force participation, improve living standards, enhance U.S. competitiveness, and promote future growth and prosperity.
