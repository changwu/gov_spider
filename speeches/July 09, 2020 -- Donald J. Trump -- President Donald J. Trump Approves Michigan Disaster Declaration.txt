    Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that a major disaster exists in the State of Michigan and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms and flooding from May 16 to May 22, 2020.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Arenac, Gladwin, Iosco, Midland, and Saginaw.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of Arenac, Gladwin, Iosco, Midland, and Saginaw.
Finally, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
Pete Gaynor, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Waddy Gonzalez as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
