    President Obama and President Medvedev spoke by phone this morning to discuss the new START Treaty and their continued close cooperation on a range of critical issues. President Medvedev congratulated President Obama on the Senate's approval of the new START Treaty, and the two leaders agreed that this was an historic event for both countries and for U.S.-Russia relations. President Obama said that the two leaders had a very productive year working together on new START, as well as Afghanistan, Iran sanctions, the 123 Agreement, issues related to the WTO, and the situation in Kyrgyzstan. President Obama also underscored the importance of the United States and Russia working together to support a peaceful referendum in Sudan and a resolution to the impasse in Cote D'Ivoire that respects the results of the recent democratic election. The two leaders wished each other a Merry Christmas, and pledged to continue their close partnership in the New Year.
