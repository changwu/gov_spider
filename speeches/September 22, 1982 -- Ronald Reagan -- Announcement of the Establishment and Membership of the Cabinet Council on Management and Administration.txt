    The President today announced the creation of the Cabinet Council on Management and Administration. This addition to the six existing Cabinet Councils will exercise White House control and supervision over the "Reform 88" Task Force, a long-term (6+years) program to improve the management and administrative systems of the Federal Government. It will also monitor implementation of the recommendations of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control and formulate government-wide policies pertaining to such executive branch management, administrative, and personnel issues as may arise from time to time.
The Cabinet Council on Management and Administration will be composed of, as a minimum, the Secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Health and Human Services, and Transportation; also, the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget, General Services Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management.
The President is Chairman of all seven Cabinet Councils. Edwin Meese III, Counsellor to the President, will serve as Chairman pro tempore of the Cabinet Council on Management and Administration.
Other Departments will be invited to participate when appropriate. A Cabinet member may attend meetings of the Cabinet Council on Management and Administration if the items under discussion are of interest. When the situation warrants, other agency heads will be invited to participate.
As with all the Cabinet Councils, the Vice President, the Chief of Staff to the President, and the Assistant to the President for Policy Development are ex officio members.
