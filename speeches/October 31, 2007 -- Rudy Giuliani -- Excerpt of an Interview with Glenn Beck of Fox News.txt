    GLENN BECK: "Did you watch with your mouth opening thinking, 'I don't even know what that answer about driver's licenses even means from Hillary Clinton?'"
MAYOR GIULIANI: "You know, she was being attacked all night for taking different positions in front of different audiences and then by the end of the night, she took different positions in front of the same audience. It was pretty amazing. I mean, in politics I've never quite seen that before. I know there are some politicians like Hillary. They say different things to different people. They use different accents in different parts of the country. I'm used to that about her now. I had never seen it happen all in one place, in one minute. And Glenn, this is not a tough issue."
BECK: "Ok. Tell me the answer to this issue."
MAYOR GIULIANI: "The answer is no. Or if you believe the opposite the answer is yes. Obama gave the answer yes. Ok. I disagree with that. I think it's a big mistake. I respect the man for having a position. My answer to it is no. Of course you don't give out driver's licenses to illegals. Among other things, it'll make it even more difficult to deal with all the fraud, all the forgery that's going on."
BECK: "I've talked to several county clerks and they say they won't issue them in New York. So we'll have the locals going against the state, which I don't even know if it agrees or disagrees with the Fed. I mean--"
MAYOR GIULIANI: "Well, I'm going to be campaigning for Republican candidates today in New York and then I'm headed off to New Hampshire, and this is a big issue here and it has really hurt Governor Spitzer because of what you're saying. People see this as inherently irresponsible, but again, it's notâ€”this is not one of those difficult issues of war and peace and diplomacy that she usually often hides behind to have two or three different positions. This one you either know the answer to this, it's yes or no, and then we can debate it."
