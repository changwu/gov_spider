    1) READY ON DAY ONE: John Kasich is the only candidate with the record to back up rhetoric. In Congress he shook things up, balanced the budget & reformed welfare. As Governor he pulled Ohio out of the ditch and made the state a jobs powerhouse.
2) ONLY ONE WHO CAN DEFEAT HILLARY: Poll after poll shows only Kasich ahead of Hillary in a potential head-to-head matchup. Trump and Cruz, on the other hand, get steamrolled.
3) WILL REVIVE THE U.S. ECONOMY: How? Balancing the federal budget, cutting taxes and streamlining regulations. He's done it before, and he'll do it again.
4) WILL KEEP AMERICA SAFE: John Kasich worked with President Reagan to get our military better prepared to win the Cold War. His nearly two decades on the Armed Services committee puts him light years ahead of the other candidates in terms of foreign policy know-how, and it shows. He has a plan to defeat ISIS, renew our alliances and rebuild the military.
5) HE'S A UNITER: Unlike other candidates, he has run a dignified, optimistic campaign that demonstrates his ability to bring people together.
