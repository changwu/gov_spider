Pool Report #11 More POTUS Quotes
At the signing ceremony in Oval Office:
"This is a very important day. I've signed the single biggest economic relief package in American history and, I must say, any other package by the way. It is twice as large as any relief every signed."
"This will deliver urgently needed relief to our nation's families, workers and businesses. That's what this is all about."
"I want to thank Republicans and Democrats for coming together, setting aside their differences and putting America first."
On to-be-announced deal for more equipment such as ventilators and masks:
"We have tremendous supplies coming into the stockpile. And you will be seeing that and hearing about that because we will be doing a news conference at 5:30 on what's happening. We have had tremendous results on the respirators. We've had great results on just about everything we're talking about. Boeing just announced they will be making the plastic face shields, which are hard to come by. They are going to be making them by the thousands per week."
He said the ventilators were the "most difficult because it is like building a car."
"We will be announcing that thousands will be built and we have them under contract and we have fast deliveries."
On enacting the Defense Production Act regarding General Motors, which he misidentified as General Electric:
He said he had used the DPC three or four times but "pulled it back three times because the companies came through in the end and we did not need the act. It has been great leverage."
"I have instituted it against General Electric. We thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and all of a sudden 40,000 came down to 6,000. And then they talked about a hight price than we were discussing. So I didn't like it. So we did activate it with respect to General Motors. Hopefully, we won't need the full activation. We'll find out but we need the ventilators."
