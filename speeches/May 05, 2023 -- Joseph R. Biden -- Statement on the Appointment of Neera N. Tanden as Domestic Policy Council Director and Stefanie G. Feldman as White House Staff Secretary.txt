    For over 2 years, Susan Rice has helped craft and implement my domestic policy agenda and our country owes a debt of gratitude for her history-making public service. I am pleased to announce that Neera Tanden will continue to drive the formulation and implementation of my domestic policy, from economic mobility and racial equity to health care, immigration and education.
As Senior Advisor and Staff Secretary, Neera oversaw decisionmaking processes across my domestic, economic, and national security teams. She has 25 years of experience in public policy, has served three Presidents, and led one of the largest think tanks in the country for nearly a decade. She was a key architect of the Affordable Care Act and helped drive key domestic policies that became part of my agenda, including clean energy subsidies and sensible gun reform. While growing up, Neera relied on some of the critical programs that she will oversee as Domestic Policy Advisor, and I know those insights will serve my administration and the American people well. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Neera in her new role.
Stef is one of my longest serving and most trusted advisors. I asked Stef to join me from the White House to the University of Delaware, to my Presidential campaign, and back to the White House because of her talent and tenacious pursuit of policies that make life better for hard-working Americans. I have now asked her to serve as Staff Secretary because I know I can trust her to ensure that I am equipped with the best advice and counsel.
