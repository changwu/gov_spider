Nate Silver of the New York Times has put together a model predicting the results of the election based on the strength of our economy, President Obama's approval rating and the ideological record of the candidate. 

Jon Huntsman ranks as the candidate most likely to defeat President Obama.

This is just another confirmation of what we've been saying all along. Jon Huntsman is the principled leader best suited to win in November 2012 based on his record as a Governor, businessman, Ambassador and what the Wall Street Journal says is the best economic plan.

I am proud to support him for President.

Please share this blog with your friends on facebook and twitter across the nation and tell them to visit www.jon2012.com to learn more about the most electable Republican candidate.

Sincerely,

Governor Tom Ridge
