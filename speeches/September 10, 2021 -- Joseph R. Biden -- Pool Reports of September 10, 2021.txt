Pool Report #12 - POTUS full quote on criticism of COVID measures 
Here's the full response from POTUS earlier today in response to the question posed to him at the school by ABC News on threats to challenge his vaccine measures in court. Apologies for the delay in getting this out:
"Have at it. Look, I am so disappointed that, particularly some of the Republican governors, have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier of the health of their communities. This is — we're playing for real here. This isn't a game.
"I don't know of any scientist out there in this field who doesn't think it makes considerable sense to do the six things I've suggested. And you know, it's a — let me conclude with this, one of the lessons I hope our students can unlearn is that politics doesn't have to be this way, politics doesn't have to be this way."
"They're growing up in an environment where they see it's like a war, like a bitter feud. If a Democrat says, 'right,' everybody says, 'left.' If a Democrat says, 'left,' they say 'right.'"
"I mean, it's now how we are as a nation, and it's not how we beat every other crisis in our history. We've got to come together. And I think the vast majority — look at the polling data — the vast majority of the American people know we have to do these things. They're hard, but necessary. We're going to get them done."
