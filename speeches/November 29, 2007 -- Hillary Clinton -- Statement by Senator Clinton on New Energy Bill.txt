    Senator Hillary Clinton today issued the following statement on a new congressional energy bill that increases biofuel production:
"I am pleased that Congressional leaders are working towards agreement on an energy bill that would increase the production of homegrown biofuels. Increasing biofuels production to 60 billion gallons by 2030 is a key component of my comprehensive plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil, take action on global warming, and revitalize rural economies. I was proud to support a Senate energy bill earlier this year that would move us towards that biofuels goal, and I will be working with Congressional colleagues to pass a final version of that bill this year."
