    I want to say something about what's taken place in Seattle today. I send my prayers and express our country's concern for our fellow citizens in Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia—areas of the State of Washington. Those folks were affected by a major earthquake today. Our prayers are with those who were injured and their families, and with the many thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted.
Thousands of people in Washington are without power or phone service. Airports are closed, and many buildings have sustained structural damage. My administration stands ready to help in any way we can. I've asked the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Joe Allbaugh, to travel to Seattle to offer our assistance. He is on his way in a couple of hours, and he'll be traveling with members of the—Washington State's congressional delegation.
I've talked to Director Allbaugh. He told me he felt like Senator Murray would be going. And they're reaching out to other members of the congressional delegation to travel with him. We will work with State and local officials to provide whatever help we can to the people of the State of Washington.
