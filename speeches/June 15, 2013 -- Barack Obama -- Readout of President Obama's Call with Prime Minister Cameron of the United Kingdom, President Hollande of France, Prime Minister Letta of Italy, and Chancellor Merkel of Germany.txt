    President Obama spoke yesterday with British Prime Minister Cameron, French President Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Letta, and German Chancellor Merkel ahead of next week's G-8 Summit in Northern Ireland, hosted by Prime Minister Cameron. The five leaders discussed Syria, including the regime's use of chemical weapons against its own people, and ways to support a political transition to end the conflict. They also discussed Libya, our collective efforts to support Prime Minister Zeidan, and the Libyan government's work to enhance security and advance the political transition. The President noted how much he is looking forward to his first trip to Europe during his second term, which will include addressing youth in Belfast, Northern Ireland; attending the G-8; and making an official visit to Berlin at the invitation of Chancellor Merkel.
