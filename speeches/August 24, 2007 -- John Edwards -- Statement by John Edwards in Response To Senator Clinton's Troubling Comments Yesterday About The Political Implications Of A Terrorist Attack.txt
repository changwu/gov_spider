    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Earlier today in New Hampshire, Senator John Edwards made the following comments when asked about Senator Hillary Clinton's comments yesterday that Republicans would have an advantage if there is another terrorist attack and that she is the best Democrat to deal with that.
"If we're talking about America being attacked the last thing we should do is be engaged in political calculation. What I would do is focus on uniting America and doing the things I need to do as president of the United States to keep this country safe."
In response to another question, Edwards said:
"Well first of all, I strongly disagree with what [Senator Clinton] said. [Senator Clinton] has said she believes that we are safer under George Bush, I strongly disagree with that. What I believe is that it is the responsibility of a presidential candidate, a serious presidential candidate, and the president of the United States when you're talking about something as serious as the potential for America to be attacked, to focus on what's good for America, not politics, and what needs to be done to keep this country safe, which is what I would do as president."
