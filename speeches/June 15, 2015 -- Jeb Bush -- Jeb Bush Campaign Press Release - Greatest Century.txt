    As Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush made a difference and changed lives.
Under his leadership, Florida led the nation in job growth, defended life, eliminated waste, and reformed schools to give every child an opportunity.
He led. He reformed. He got results.
It's time for a President with that same mentality â€” who sees solutions when others see problems.
This country is on the verge of its greatest century. Jeb is ready to lead.
