Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!Retweets: 24597Favorites: 137858

The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!Retweets: 56083Favorites: 206672
