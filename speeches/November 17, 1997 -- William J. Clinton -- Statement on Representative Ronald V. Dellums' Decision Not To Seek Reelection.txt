    Representative Ron Dellums has been an indefatigable advocate in the Congress for the interests of ordinary Americans, in Oakland and throughout the Nation. He has worked hard to secure policies and programs that respond to the needs of poor and middle income families. I have appreciated his strong voice and his effective work for justice and reconciliation, not only here but around the world. He has been a highly forceful leader for our national security, making sure that the vital work of national defense is conducted with a watchful eye on taxpayer dollars.
I thank Ron for his long and effective years of commitment and service to America. The people of Oakland and the Nation owe him a debt of gratitude.
