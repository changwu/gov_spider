    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 3/24/92)(Senate)(Baucus (D) MT and Burns (R) MT)
The Administration has no objection to Senate passage of S. 1696, if the bill is amended to release for multiple-use management those Forest Service lands that are designated by the bill as wilderness study areas. This amendment would provide a balance between wilderness protection, recreation, and resource utilization, consistent with the recommendations in the National Forest Land Management Plan for Montana.
In addition, the language to release Federal lands for multiple- use management must be amended to clarify what is precluded from judicial review. This is necessary to avoid possible unnecessary litigation.
