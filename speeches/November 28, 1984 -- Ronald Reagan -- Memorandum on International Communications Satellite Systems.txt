Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce
By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including Sections 102(d) and 201(a) of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, as amended (47 U.S.C. 701(d), 721(a)), I hereby determine that separate international communications satellite systems are required in the national interest. The United States, in order to meet its obligations under the Agreement Establishing the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) (TIAS 7532), shall consult with INTELSAT regarding such separate systems as are authorized by the Federal Communications Commission. You are directed jointly to inform the Federal Communications Commission of criteria necessary to ensure the United States meets its international obligations and to further its telecommunications and foreign policy interests.
This determination shall be published in the Federal Register.
