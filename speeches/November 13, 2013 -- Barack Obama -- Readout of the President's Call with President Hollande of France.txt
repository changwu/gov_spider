    The President and President Hollande spoke today as part of their ongoing discussions on shared security interests, including recent developments related to Iran. The United States and France are in full agreement regarding the P5+1's unified proposal to Iran and the approach to negotiations. They consider the P5+1 proposal to be a sound step toward assuring the international community that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. The United States deeply values its relationship with France, including as NATO allies, and we will continue to consult closely on global security.
