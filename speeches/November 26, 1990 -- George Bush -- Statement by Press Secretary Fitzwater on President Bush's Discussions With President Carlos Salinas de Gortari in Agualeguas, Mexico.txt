    President Bush and President Salinas had lunch at the Salinas family home in Agualeguas and discussed a number of bilateral and regional issues. President Bush enjoyed the family home environment and the stay in this picturesque Mexican town. It was another opportunity, in an informal environment, for the two leaders to discuss the warm relationship between the United States and Mexico.
Much of their discussion focused on the free-trade agreement and the status of talks that have been held so far. Both Presidents are interested in pursuing the agreement as fast as possible and attach high priority to its successful conclusion.
President Bush and President Salinas also discussed increased cooperation in the war against drug trafficking, and they emphasized a commitment to do everything possible to end border violence.
The leaders discussed the situation in El Salvador, agreeing to press for a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement to the situation.
These issues and others will be discussed in greater detail at tomorrow morning's business session and the plenary meeting involving Cabinet officers in both countries. President Bush believes the first day has been enormously successful and appreciates the generous hospitality of President Salinas and the Mexican people. Both the President and Mrs. Bush were overwhelmed by the warmth and enthusiasm of the crowds that greeted them in Monterrey and the numbers of citizens who followed their motorcade into the city. It was a very heartwarming welcome to be received in such an enthusiastic manner.
