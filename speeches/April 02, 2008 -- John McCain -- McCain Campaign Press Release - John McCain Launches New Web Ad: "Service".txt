Script For "Service" (1:47-Web) 
ANNCR: The Naval Academy at Annapolis compels traditions.
Veneration of courage and resilience.
An honor code that assumes fidelity to principles.
Homage paid to Americans who sacrificed greatly for our country.
The expectation that those who pass through the halls will prove worthy of our country's trust.
John McCain had a difficult time adjusting to the discipline imposed on him at the Academy.
But ultimately he learned -- he grew to understand the honor of serving a cause greater than his self interest.
And when the calamity of fate delivered him to North Vietnam it was an understanding of honor that changed his life forever.
He found his cause: citizenship in the greatest nation on earth.
Citizenship defined by countless acts of love, kindness and courage that have no witness, and no heraldry.
Sacrifice for a cause greater than yourself, and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause, your self-respect assured.
John McCain has spent fifty years in the service of this country and its ideals.
He has never lived a day, in good times or bad, that he wasn't grateful for the privilege.
