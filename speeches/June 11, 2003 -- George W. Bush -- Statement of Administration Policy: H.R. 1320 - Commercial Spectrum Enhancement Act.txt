    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Upton (R) Michigan and 16 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1320, which would create a spectrum relocation fund. The Administration believes that the fund will serve as an important spectrum management tool to streamline the process for reimbursing government users, facilitate their relocation to comparable spectrum, and provide greater certainty to auction bidders and incumbents. This legislation will also expedite the opening of spectrum to commercial use for new services and technologies for consumers.
The Administration is pleased that H.R. 1320 closely tracks the Administration's proposal to create a spectrum relocation fund. The Administration urges quick action by the Congress to establish a spectrum relocation fund to make the spectrum management process more effective and efficient.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1320 would affect direct spending. The Budget Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go requirements and discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002. The Administration supports the extension of these budget enforcement mechanisms in a manner that ensures fiscal discipline and is consistent with the President's budget.
