    Yesterday the announcement tour migrated further south to Miami, where Jon visited with small business owners to hear their ideas on how to jump start the economy. Then it was off to Orlando for the official opening of the campaign's national headquarters.

Speaking to staff and supporters, Mary Kaye noted that she couldn't imagine a better 50th birthday present than having the headquarters located in her hometown. Jon talked about the campaign's focus on the economy and jobs, and the need to involve young people. He also reminded the staff about his call for civility. We're all very excited that the Huntsman campaign is the first to locate its headquarters in Florida.
Today, we're off to Nevada where Jon will meet with local leaders and business owners, and even take in a rodeo.
