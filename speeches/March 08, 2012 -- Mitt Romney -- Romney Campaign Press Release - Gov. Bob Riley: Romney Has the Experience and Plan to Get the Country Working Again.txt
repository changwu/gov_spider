    "I really do believe that because of that experience, I think Mitt can do some things, because he's proven it, he's proven it in real life before. I think he's got a plan that really can get this economy back working again. And if you really believe that, if you believe that he can do it, then the question becomes why would you not support him?" â€” Former Alabama Governor Bob Riley

Former Alabama Governor Bob Riley On Why He Supports Mitt Romney:
GOVERNOR BOB RILEY: "The one thing that differentiates Mitt from Newt or from Rick, at least in my opinion, is the guy has spent most of his adult life in the private sector. And I really do think, maybe because I was a businessman until I was 52 years old before I got into politics, there really is a difference in the way you look at Washington laws and regulations or Alabama's laws and regulations, when you know what the physical impact is on your operation. If you know that a regulation is going to cause you to lay have to off someone, it's going to up the cost of your product where you're not competitive anymore. I don't think there's anything, Leland, that's out there today that's more important than getting this economy stimulated and back to the point where people today have the opportunities that they have had for the last 40 or 50 years. I really do believe that because of that experience, I think Mitt can do some things, because he's proven it, he's proven it in real life before. I think he's got a plan that really can get this economy back working again. And if you really believe that, if you believe that he can do it, then the question becomes why would you not support him?"
