    Des Moines, IA - Cory Booker is beginning 2020 with a powerhouse list of new endorsements from current and former Iowa elected officials and critical caucus activists. Led by Iowa State Representative Charlie McConkey, the latest list of Iowans to join Cory's caucus coalition includes Linn County Supervisor Ben Rogers, Story County Treasurer Ted Rasmussen, Dubuque City Council Member Brad Cavanaugh, former State Representative Nate Willems and more.
"Iowa needs a president who will go to Washington, rise above the useless partisanship, and get things done. Cory Booker is ready to be that president on day one. He's an experienced executive who has already proven that he can achieve real results for his constituents. My constituents can't afford to wait years for affordable health care and jobs that pay a living wage and real solutions to our devastating floods, which is why I'll be proud to caucus for Cory Booker on February 3rd," said State Representative Charlie McConkey.
Cory continues to build momentum in Iowa, recently launching a six-figure, 60-second ad buy in the state. State Representative Charlie McConkey becomes the eighth member of the Iowa State Legislature to endorse Cory. He and this new group of endorsers join a list of more than 100 Iowa leaders who will be in the caucus rooms advocating for Cory on February 3rd.
