    On behalf of the American people, I want to extend my best wishes to all those who are celebrating Armenian National Day in Armenia, in the United States, and around the world. This 20th anniversary of independence and Armenia's achievements during this time show the progress that is possible when people are free to determine their own destiny. Here in the United States, we are grateful for the Armenian Americans who enrich our national life every day and who help sustain the strong and growing relationship between our two countries.
