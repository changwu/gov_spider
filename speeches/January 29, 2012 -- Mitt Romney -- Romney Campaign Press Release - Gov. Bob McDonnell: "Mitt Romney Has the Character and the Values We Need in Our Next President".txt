    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's comments about Mitt Romney's character:
"I was very disappointed to hear Speaker Gingrich make comments today that impugned Governor Romney's character through attacks on his business record, his record of public service, and now on his personal integrity. I know Mitt and Ann well. They are people of great faith and the highest character and have raised five wonderful children over their 42 years of marriage. Mitt Romney's moral fitness for office is beyond reproach and is a major reason that I am so pleased to support his campaign. Mitt Romney has the character and the values we need in our next President."
