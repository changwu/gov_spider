    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with President Emmanuel Macron of France about the President's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. President Trump underscored that his decision is necessary and appropriate to protect national security. Both Presidents discussed alternative ways to address United States concerns. The two leaders also conferred about President Trump's intention to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to ensure the complete and permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Both Presidents sharply condemned the Assad regime, and its Russian and Iranian sponsors, for the atrocities it has committed, including the bombing in East Ghouta.
