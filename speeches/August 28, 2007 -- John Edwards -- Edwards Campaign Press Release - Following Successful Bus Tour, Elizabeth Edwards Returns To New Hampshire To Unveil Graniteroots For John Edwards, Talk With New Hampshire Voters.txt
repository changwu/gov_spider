    Manchester, NH â€“ On Thursday, August 30th, Elizabeth Edwards will return to New Hampshire and make stops in Bow, Manchester, and Mount Vernon. Elizabeth will unveil the campaign's Graniteroots for John Edwards grassroots program by dropping off school supplies gathered by supporters and volunteers throughout the month of August at John Edwards' New Hampshire events.
Graniteroots for John Edwards underscores the grassroots nature of John Edwards' campaign in New Hampshire. Throughout the state, the Edwards campaign is building community support as neighbors talk to neighbors not just about John Edwards' bold policies, but about the ways that we can take action in our communities to bring about real change in this country. The Graniteroots for John Edwards are organizing and hosting house meetings, knocking on doors, making phone calls and taking action in communities across New Hampshire to help build the one America that we all believe in.
On Thursday, Elizabeth Edwards will speak directly with voters about John's bold and detailed policies, donate the collected school supplies, and participate in a roundtable with teachers.
Her return follows the wildly successful 'Fighting for One America' bus tour that made 17 stops in New Hampshire over four days, culminating in a 1,000-person rally in Portsmouth.
