    As you know, Attorney General Bell has previously stated on several occasions his intention to leave the Department of Justice prior to the 1980 election year.
The President will nominate Deputy Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti to succeed Attorney General Bell. To ensure an orderly transition in this important department, Attorney General Bell's resignation will become effective when Mr. Civiletti is confirmed by the Senate and sworn into office.
