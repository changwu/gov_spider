(House)(Mica (R) FL and 109 cosponsors)
The Administration supports the provisions of H.R. 3452 that would apply civil rights, labor, and workplace laws to the Executive Office of the President. Most of these provisions are already being followed as a matter of law or policy by agencies and offices within the Executive Office of the President. The Administration could support House passage of H.R. 3452, however, only if it is amended to delete the provisions establishing an Inspector General (IG) Office within the Executive Office of the President.
The Department of Justice has advised that the IG provisions raise serious constitutional concerns on separation of powers grounds. These objectionable provisions would interfere significantly with the discharge of the President's constitutional authority. According to the Department of Justice, when the President is exercising exclusive constitutional authority, Congress is without authority to impose such requirements. Further, the Executive Office of the President is already subject to direct review by congressional committees and the General Accounting Office.
