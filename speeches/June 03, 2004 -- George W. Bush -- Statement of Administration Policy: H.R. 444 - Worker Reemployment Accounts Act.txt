    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Porter (R-NV) and 39 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 444, the "Worker Reemployment Accounts Act." This legislation would authorize a pilot program within the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to establish innovative Personal Reemployment Accounts (PRAs). The Administration is pleased that the House is now acting on this important part of the President's agenda.
PRAs embody one of the Administration's guiding principles: that wherever possible, resources and decision-making belong directly in the hands of individuals. These flexible accounts, which would be in addition to unemployment compensation, would allow certain unemployed workers to purchase the training, child care, transportation, or other reemployment services they need to return to work, and allow them to keep unused amounts as a "reemployment bonus" if they become employed quickly.
The Administration urges Congress to act on this important legislation for America's workers.
