    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Weller (R) Illinois and 225 cosponsors)
The Administration supports the House's action on H.R. 6 as another positive step on the way to passage of the President's tax relief plan. H.R. 6 is consistent with the objectives of the President's tax plan, which lowers the tax burden on families and restores fairness by, among other things, reducing tax rates, expanding the child credit, and significantly reducing the marriage penalty. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress as the legislative process continues to achieve a result that best embodies the objectives of the President's plan.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
Any law that would reduce receipts is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Accordingly, H.R. 6 or any substitute amendment in lieu thereof, that would also reduce revenues, will be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement.
The Administration will work with Congress to ensure that any unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current law or the enactment of any other proposals that meet the President's objectives.
