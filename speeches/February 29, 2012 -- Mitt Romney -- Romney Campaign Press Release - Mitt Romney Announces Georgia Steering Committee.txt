    Mitt Romney today announced his Georgia Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will be led by Romney for President Georgia State Chairman Attorney General Sam Olens.
"Georgia voters are tired of the failed promises from President Obama," said Mitt Romney. "They are looking for a leader who will create jobs and stop the growth of government. With the help of these Georgia leaders, I will be able to defeat President Obama and put in place common-sense conservative principles to turn around our economy and shrink government."
"Mitt Romney's plan for more jobs, less debt and smaller government is one of the many reasons that Georgia conservatives are getting behind his campaign," said Attorney General Sam Olens. "The Steering Committee has been hard at work spreading Mitt Romney's pro-growth message and will continue the hard work of defeating President Obama in November."
