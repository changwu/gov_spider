This morning on the nationally syndicated Mike Gallagher Show, Marco was asked about Ted Cruz's continued attacks. Here's his response.
Unfortunately, although he's a friend of mine, Ted Cruz has spent the better part of the last two weeks making things up, about my record. On Planned Parenthood, so National Right to Life had to rebuke him. He had an ad pulled off the air because he was not being truthful about my position on sanctuary cities. He was not being truthful about my position on the definition of marriage, so, you know, you can't let those things stand.

Indeed, a Cruz Super PAC ad was pulled off the air because of legal worries and pro-life leaders from around the country rebuked Cruz's attack on Marco's exceptional record on life.Whenever he can, Marco's going to keep his message focused on strengthening America and creating opportunity. 
When he's attacked, however, he'll respond, and he'll call out dishonesty.
