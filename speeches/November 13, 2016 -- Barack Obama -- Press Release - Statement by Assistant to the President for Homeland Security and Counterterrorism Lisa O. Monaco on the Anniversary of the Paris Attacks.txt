    One year ago, the people of France responded with bravery and determination to barbaric attacks carried out by ISIL terrorists across Paris. In the hours and days after the attacks, Paris and the people of France showed their resilience and that of the City of Light. Today, the United States is proud to stand strong with our oldest ally as we have, along with our international and local partners, accelerated our fight against ISIL. Together, we are destroying ISIL and its false claim to a caliphate; our Coalition's efforts to strengthen the capability of local forces to expel ISIL from their strongholds are showing significant results; our forces have conducted precision air strikes against ISIL leaders and those plotting to harm our citizens, and our law enforcement and intelligence experts exchange information to ensure we stay ahead of any potential threats to France and the homeland. Throughout, the United States and France have and will continue to be united by common values and shared interests, and we remain steadfast in our determination to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.
