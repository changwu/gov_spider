LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced today that it has raised more than $8 million in the third quarter from more than 100,000 unique donors — more than five times the number of total donors to the campaign of Texas Governor Rick Perry.
"The amount and nature of donations to Ron Paul proves his fundraising prowess and also demonstrates in real numbers the grassroots support Dr. Paul receives from average Americans," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
Dr. Paul shared his fundraising results total at a luncheon speech at the National Press Club.Authorized and paid for by Ron Paul 2012 PCC Inc. www.RonPaul2012.com
