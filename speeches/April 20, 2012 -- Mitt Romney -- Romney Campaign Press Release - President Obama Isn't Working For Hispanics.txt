    "This campaign will be about President Obama's record in office — and nowhere is that record of failure more clear than in the Hispanic community. After promising to fix America's economic hardships in 2008, President Obama's failed policies have left millions of Hispanics without jobs and millions more in poverty." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
In 2008, Barack Obama Promised To Address The Economic Hardships Facing Hispanics — But He Hasn't Delivered During His Time In Office:
Candidate Obama, In 2008: "More Americans Are Out Of Work ... We All Know The Hispanic Community Has Been Especially Hard Hit." OBAMA: "More Americans are out of work, and have mortgages they can't pay, and cars they can't afford to drive, and wonder how they'll ever afford to retire. And we've all seen the statistics - we all know the Hispanic community has been especially hard hit. Now, we didn't get here by accident." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks, Washington, DC, 9/10/08)

    Since February 2009, The Unemployment Rate For Hispanic Or Latino Workers Has Remained Above 10% Every Month. (Bureau Of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov, Accessed 4/19/12)

"Large shares report that they or someone in their household has been out of work in the past year (59%); that their personal finances are in "only fair" or "poor" shape (75%); that they canceled or delayed a major purchase in the past year (49%); or that they are underwater on their mortgage (28% of Latino homeowners)." (Paul Taylor, et al, "Hispanics Say They Have The Worst Of A Bad Economy," Pew Research Center, 1/26/12)
"Hispanic Households Lost 66 Percent Of Their Net Worth During The Recession..." "The Pew Research Center has released data showing that Hispanic households lost 66 percent of their net worth during the recession compared with a 16 percent loss by white households." (Kristin Roberts and Stacy Kaper, "The White House's Housing Fumbles," National Journal, 3/22/12)
Hispanics Account For Nearly 30% Of Americans Living In Poverty, An Increase Under President Obama Of Nearly 2.3 Million. (U.S. Census Bureau Website, www.census.gov, Accessed 4/19/12)
And Candidate Obama Also Promised To Address The Number Of Hispanics Without Health Care — But That Number Has Increased During His Presidency:
Candidate Obama, In 2008: "This Election Is About The 45 Million Americans Who Don't Have Health Care - One In Three Hispanics ... They're Counting On Us To Guarantee Health Care..." OBAMA: "This election is about the 45 million Americans who don't have health care - one in three Hispanics - and about the small business owners who can barely stay afloat because of rising health care costs. They're counting on us to guarantee health care for anyone who needs it and make it affordable for anyone who wants it. That's what I'll do as President." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks, Washington, DC, 9/10/08)
"Hispanic Americans Continue To Be The Most Likely To Be Uninsured, With More Than 40% Going Without Health Coverage In 2011." "Hispanic Americans continue to be the most likely to be uninsured, with more than 40% going without health coverage in 2011, the highest Gallup has found for any key group since it began tracking in 2008. More than 30% of low-income Americans were uninsured in 2011 -- a figure that has been rising since 2008, when it was 26.4%." (Elizabeth Mendes, "More Americans Uninsured In 2011," Gallup, 1/24/12)
"An Average Of 49% Of Residents Is Hispanic In The 10 Metro Areas With The Highest Uninsured Rates, Compared With 8.3% In The 10 Areas With The Lowest Rates." (Elizabeth Mendes, "Uninsured Rates Vary From 4% To 50% Across U.S. Metro Areas," Gallup, 3/27/12)
