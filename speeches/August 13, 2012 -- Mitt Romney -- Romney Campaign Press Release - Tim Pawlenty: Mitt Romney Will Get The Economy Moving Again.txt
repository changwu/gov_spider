TIM PAWLENTY: "Well, the Romney-Ryan plan and Governor Romney's plan before that and forthcoming is about getting this economy moving again. The President likes to talk about allowing people to achieve or even exceed the middle class. Well, guess what, Larry? It's really hard to be middle class if you are unemployed. It's really hard to stay in the middle class if you don't have a job. This is about who's got a better idea to get this economy moving and get investments and jobs growing in this country. Barack Obama's had his chance. It's a failed presidency. It's a shrinking presidency. Now we have a chance to give Mitt Romney, somebody who's actually done this in the private sector, the leadership reins."
