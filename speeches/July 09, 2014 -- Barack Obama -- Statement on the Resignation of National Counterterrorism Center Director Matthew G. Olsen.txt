    Most Americans may not know Matt Olsen's name, but every American is safer because of his service. As Director of the National Counterterrorism Center for the past 3 years, Matt and the dedicated professionals he has led at the NCTC have been absolutely critical to our success in disrupting terrorist cells, thwarting attacks, and protecting the American people from evolving threats at home and abroad. I've relied on Matt's wise judgment and counsel, and I am especially grateful for his work to ensure that our counterterrorism efforts remain consistent with the rule of law and our values as a nation. As he concludes 24 years of Federal service, I thank Matt for a distinguished career that has left our Nation more secure and even better prepared to meet the threats of our time.
