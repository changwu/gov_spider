    One day 'moneybomb' haul adds to momentum
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Over the weekend, 2012 Republican presidential contender Ron Paul has scored another major boost in his campaign's momentum with a 24 hour fundraising haul of over $1.6 million in small individual donations.
"Our campaign is surging, and today's money bomb results show the strength of our grassroots support," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "We've just come off of an impressive finish in the Iowa straw poll, and our growing poll numbers and strong fundraising proves that our message is resonating with people."
This impressive fundraising feat was achieved despite a cyber-attack being launched against the campaign website during the online money bomb, shutting down the site for at least a few hours before it was restored. Paul's campaign has now cracked the million-dollar mark in one day fundraising four times.
