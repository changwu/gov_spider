    Iraq's Transitional National Assembly has voted by an overwhelming margin to confirm Ibrahim al-Jafari as Iraq's next Prime Minister. They also have approved a list of Cabinet ministers who will represent the unity and diversity of Iraq in the months ahead. I join with all Americans in congratulating Iraq's new leaders and in wishing them well as they begin to serve their country in this new Government. I appreciate the dedicated work of the outgoing Interim Government, which has governed Iraq for the last 10 months.
The Iraqi Transitional Government will confront important challenges in fighting terrorists and enemies of democracy, training the Iraqi security forces, and providing basic services to its citizens. It will also lead the difficult and essential work of drafting a new constitution for a free and democratic Iraq. The United States is confident that the new Government will meet these challenges in the months ahead, and America will stand by Iraq, its leaders, and the Iraqi people as they continue their work to establish a stable, peaceful, and democratic Iraq.
