    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Utah Governor Gary Herbert.
"I'm pleased to have Gary's support," said Mitt Romney. "Like Americans all across the country, Utah residents are struggling under President Obama's failed policies and broken promises. As president, I will put in place pro-growth and conservative economic policies that will get Americans working again."
"Now is the time for Republicans to coalesce around the one GOP candidate who can defeat President Obama and get our great nation back on the right track," said Governor Gary Herbert. "We need a leader with an unwavering moral compass. We need a leader who can offer results, not rhetoric. That candidate is Mitt Romney. In a time when millions of Americans cannot find work, we need a leader who has an indisputable track record of job creation and business building. Mitt Romney is the leader America needs and deserves."
