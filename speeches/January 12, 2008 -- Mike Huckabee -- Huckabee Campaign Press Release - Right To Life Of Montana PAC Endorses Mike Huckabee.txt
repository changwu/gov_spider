    LITTLE ROCK, AR -- The Right to Life of Montana Political Action Committee has endorsed former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in the race for President of the United States.
"Governor Huckabee's stance on the sanctity of life has always been clear and consistent, without wavering. No candidate has a stronger record on the sanctity of life than Mike Huckabee," said State Chairman Steve Daines.
Right to Life of Montana is an organization that believes that all life is fragile and that life is the "first inalienable right." The group was founded more than 30 years ago to protect the elderly, the handicapped and the unborn.
RTLM is the official state affiliate of the National Right to Life Committee. It is an organization that uses legislation and educational programs to help Montana citizens become aware of the truths behind the abortion industry. It represents 40,000 pro-life households in Montana.
"We're proud to announce our endorsement of Governor Huckabee," said RTLM Executive Director Gregg Trude. "Mike Huckabee has been a leader in upholding the value of human life. As our next President, Mike Huckabee will support the passage of a constitutional amendment to protect the right to life. He will also appoint judges that will support overturning Roe v. Wade."
RTLM noted Huckabee's record as governor of Arkansas in the endorsement. As governor, he helped pass parental notification, an informed consent law, a bill requiring that a woman be told her baby will experience pain during an abortion and offer anesthesia for her baby and a bill to make it a crime for an unborn baby to be injured or murdered during an attack on its mother.
"That's why Right to Life of Montana urges strong support for Mike Huckabee," Trude said
