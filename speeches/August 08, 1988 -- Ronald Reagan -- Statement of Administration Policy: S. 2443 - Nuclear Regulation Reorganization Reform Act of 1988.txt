    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised - LA)
(Senate)(Breaux (D) Louisiana)
While the Administration supports the intent of S. 2443, to reorganize and streamline the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the approach taken in S. 2443 raises serious concerns for the Administration. Accordingly, the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend disapproval of S. 2443 unless the bill is modified to accommodate the Administration's concerns.
First, the bill raises constitutional concerns involving the confidentiality of the Executive's deliberative process, the decision-making process within the Executive branch, and a funding-related legislative veto issue.
Second, the bill would impose statutorily inflexible deadlines for OMB review of the new agency's regulations, thereby inhibiting effective Executive branch internal management.
