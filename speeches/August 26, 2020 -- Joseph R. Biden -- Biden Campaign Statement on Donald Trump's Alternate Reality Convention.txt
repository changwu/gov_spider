    In response to the second night of the Republican Convention, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"President Trump's RNC is an alternate reality. In this delusion, thousands of Americans didn't die in the last week from COVID-19, nor have millions of Americans been infected or put out of work. Our economy hasn't ground to a halt and our kids aren't being kept home from school. Donald Trump's continual refusal to take this virus seriously has given the United States the worst outbreak in the world, and his convention's refusal to come to grips with reality or acknowledge the magnitude of the loss is a stark reminder to Americans of his complete failure to lead.
"Not only did the American people hear no plan for overcoming the pandemic for the second consecutive night of the RNC — after more than seven months of utter mismanagement — but the president's chief economic adviser even referred to the coronavirus in the past tense.
"The American people can't afford for Donald Trump to bury his head in the sand any longer. As Vice President Biden has been saying since the beginning of this crisis, we need action, not more denial from this White House. We need more testing and protective equipment, not more excuses. And most importantly, we need real leadership, and we need it now."
