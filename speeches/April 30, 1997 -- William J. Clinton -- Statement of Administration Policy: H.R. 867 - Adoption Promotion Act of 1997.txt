    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Camp (R) MI and 31 others)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 867 and applauds the bipartisan manner in which the bill was developed. H.R. 867 will further Administration and congressional efforts to ensure the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in the child welfare system.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 867 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB estimates that the net effect of the adoption assistance incentive payments and lower foster care payments would be zero in each of FYs 1999-2003.
