    Biden is an empty vessel for the radical left.
Joe Biden's radical-left handlers are telling him what to do, and they just accidentally tweeted out the evidence.
A photo released by the Biden campaign shows Biden reading from a typed script on a paper in front him, holding his phone upside down, as he asked Harris to be his political living will.
"I've had a lot of great advice. I am calling you today," Biden's script reads in part. "I think you are entitled to know why I chose you. There are three reasons," it continues.
Biden is nothing but a weak "transition" candidate and an empty vessel for the radical left. The script typed up for him proves it.
