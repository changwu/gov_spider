    Widow of former Oklahoma Labor Commissioner Mark Costello supports Cruz
HOUSTON, Texas – Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced the endorsement of Oklahoma leader and widow of former Oklahoma Labor Commissioner Mark Costello.
"I am humbled to have the support of Cathy Costello, a strong conservative leader in Oklahoma," said Cruz.  "Cathy has continued a proud legacy of service to Oklahoma left by her husband, Mark."
"Since the murder of my husband at the hands of our son, I have dedicated my time and energy to removing the stigma of mental illness and encouraging lawmakers to openly talk about mental health as a serious political and economic issue," said Costello.
"One in four Americans suffer with mental illness and addiction. Ted is the only candidate who has dedicated himself to addressing mental health. He authored legislation expanding mental health courts and crisis intervention, and he has a personal interest and understanding of the tragedy of mental illness. We need a leader who is bold enough to address this national crisis we have deliberately ignored for far too long. The best chance we have to see real reform, to openly discuss solutions to the mental illness epidemic that destroys families regardless of socio-economic status, is to elect Ted Cruz as our next President."
Cathy Costello is the widow of former Oklahoma Labor Commissioner Mark Costello. They were married almost 34 years. Mark Costello was tragically murdered by his mentally ill son in August of 2015. Since that tragedy, Cathy Costello has dedicated herself to breaking down mental illness stigmas and encouraging lawmakers to address mental illness as a serious political and economic issue.
