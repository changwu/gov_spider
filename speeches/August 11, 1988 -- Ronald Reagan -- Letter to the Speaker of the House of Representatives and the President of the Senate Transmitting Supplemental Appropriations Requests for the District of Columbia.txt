    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting two requests for FY 1988 budget supplementals for the District of Columbia. These two supplementals (the second and third for FY 1988) total $76,939,000. The first proposes a $31,939,000 net increase in the City's General Fund Budget, including $46,935,000 in program increases and $14,996,000 in rescission of budget authority of District agencies. The second supplemental proposes a $45,000,000 increase in the District's Capital Outlay Budget.
These increases are in District of Columbia funds and do not affect the Federal Budget.
Also, I am taking this opportunity to reiterate my request that the Congress ensure that none of the funds appropriated for the District of Columbia be used for abortion unless the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. Thus, I will support an amendment to the District of Columbia's appropriations bill that restricts the use of both the District's Federal and locally generated funds for abortion.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
