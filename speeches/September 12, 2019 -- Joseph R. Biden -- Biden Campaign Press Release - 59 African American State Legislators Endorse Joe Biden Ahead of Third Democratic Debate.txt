    Today, Biden for President is announcing 59 African American state legislators from 15 states who are endorsing Joe Biden ahead of the third Democratic debate. As Vice President Biden's campaign expands across the country, today's endorsements come from key Super Tuesday states like California, Minnesota, and Tennessee, as well as crucial battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
Today's endorsements also include 26 Georgia state legislators, including the legislature's Black Caucus Chair, House Democratic Caucus Chair, and the President-Elect of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL).

We are honored to have the support of these respected leaders from across the country who are helping us assemble the strongest campaign in the country," said Greg Schultz, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "The endorsements of local elected officials who are committed to getting things done for their communities are imperative in our campaign's fight for the soul of America and to defeat Donald Trump."
