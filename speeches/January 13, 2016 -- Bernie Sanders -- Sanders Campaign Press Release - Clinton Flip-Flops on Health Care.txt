    WASHINGTON â€“ Hillary Clinton once said it "undermined core Democratic values" and gives "aid and comfort" to the special interests and "their allies in the Republican Party" for Democrats to attack each other's health care plans. Today, in another flip-flop, she's doing exactly what she once decried.
In the wake of new polls showing that Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign is gaining ground or leading in the Iowa caucuses, Clinton's campaign has stepped up attacks on Sanders and his health care proposal. The most recent volley is an attack on Sanders' plan to create a Medicare-for-all health care system for all Americans.
Clinton's attacks on a Democratic Party rival over universal health care marks a very public flip flop by her and her campaign. She is now using the same Karl Rove tactics she once decried in this video.
