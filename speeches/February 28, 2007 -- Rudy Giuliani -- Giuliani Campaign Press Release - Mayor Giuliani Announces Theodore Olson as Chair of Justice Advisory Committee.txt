    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee today announced that former Solicitor General Theodore Olson will chair the Mayor's Justice Advisory Committee.
In supporting the Mayor's candidacy, Olson said Giuliani has the strength and conviction to lead the country. "I've known Rudy Giuliani for over 25 years and I trust his principles and his judgment. Since our days working together in the Reagan Administration, I've been able to see firsthand Rudy's strength of character and demonstrated leadership. I am confident Mayor Giuliani is the proven leader our Party and our country need to move forward."
"Ted Olson is a renowned Constitutional expert, one of the very best lawyers in the United States and I am honored to have his support," Mayor Giuliani said. "Judith and I are even more honored by his friendship."
Theodore Olson served as the 42nd United States Solicitor General, from 2001 to 2004 and under President Reagan as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel from 1981 to 1984. Olson has argued 44 cases in the Supreme Court and numerous cases in federal and state appellate courts.
