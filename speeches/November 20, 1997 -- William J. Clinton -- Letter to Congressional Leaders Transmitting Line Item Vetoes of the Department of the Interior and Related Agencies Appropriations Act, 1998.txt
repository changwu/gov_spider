    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the attached reports, contained in the "Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998" (H.R. 2107). I have determined that the cancellation of these amounts will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, together with its attachments, constitutes a special message under section 1022 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
