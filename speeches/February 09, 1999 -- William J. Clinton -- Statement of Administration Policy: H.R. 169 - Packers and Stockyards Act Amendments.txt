    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Latham (R) IA and five cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 169, which would expand the Department of Agriculture price reporting pilot investigation to cover swine.
This pilot investigation, however, does not require publicly reported prices and, thus, will not result in improved market transparency for America's farmers and ranchers. The Administration believes that the Secretary of Agriculture should have the authority to establish a mandatory price reporting program for cattle, sheep, and swine. The Administration, therefore, will soon propose legislation to authorize the Secretary to establish such a mandatory price reporting program.
