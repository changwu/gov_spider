Here's what he had to say about his endorsement:

Like Marco, my family came to this country in pursuit of the American Dream. Marco's positive vision for the 21st Century will create jobs and opportunities for the next generation. I look forward to leading his team in Arizona.
Like @marcorubio my family came to this country in pursuit of the American Dream. I support his bold economic vision for the next generation

Mark's mother emigrated from former Yugoslavia in the 1950s.
Watch a report on the endorsement from Arizona's Fox 10:
With Brnovich's announcement, we're up to 26 states with chairmen or co-chairs — and we've got plans to roll out more soon. Stay tuned!
