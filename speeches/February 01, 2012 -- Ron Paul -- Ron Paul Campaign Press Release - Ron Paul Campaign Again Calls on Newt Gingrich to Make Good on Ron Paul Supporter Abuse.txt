LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign again called on Congressman and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich to rectify the damage his campaign staff did when it injured and humiliated a Florida Ron Paul supporter at a voting precinct.
Yesterday members of the Gingrich team assaulted 29-year-old Ron Paul supporter Eddie Dillard in the Orlando suburb of Windermere, Florida. Details of the appalling incident can be found here.
Mr. Dillard sought medical attention and X-Rays revealed that his foot was fractured. He has been referred to an orthopedist and is currently in a walking boot.
Mr. Dillard has also been in touch with law enforcement and is filing criminal charges.
Today the Ron Paul campaign is calling on Congressman Gingrich to make good on the injuries Dillard sustained.
"Newt's campaign staff broke Eddie Dillard's foot, yet we still have not heard from Gingrich about how he plans to right the situation. Today, we are calling on Newt Gingrich to pay for Eddie's medical bills. In addition, we wish Eddie a full and speedy recovery," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
