    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that for the second quarter in a row the campaign leads the Republican field in dollars raised. The campaign showed another strong quarter, totaling over $11 million raised and over $16 million total cash on hand. The campaign reported raising over $10.5 million in primary dollars this quarter.
This quarter's numbers also reflect the donations from supporters from over 1000 grassroots house parties that took place across the country in September. Contributions have been received from all fifty states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
"In a continued sign of growing support, our campaign has led the Republican field for the second quarter in a row in the fundraising race. We're receiving real support from across the country because voters know Rudy Giuliani is the only candidate who has proven leadership, executive experience and can beat the Democrats in November," said Giuliani Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime.
