    IN MY LETTER to the Congress on March 12, I expressed my concern about the effect on the large number of long-term unemployed of the imminent expiration of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation program.1 I urged therefore that early consideration be given by the Congress to the legislation calling for permanent improvement of the Federal-State unemployment insurance system.
1 See Item 80.
It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that the Committees before whom this legislation is pending have such heavy schedules that they will be unable this year to give to this legislation the consideration it deserves.
In view of the fact that the present temporary program is expiring, and in view of the dire need of the large number of long-term unemployed, I believe that something must be done immediately to help them after they exhaust regular benefits. Accordingly, I shall shortly send to the Congress recommendations for appropriately extending the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation program, with retroactively to those unemployed who exhaust their benefits after April 1 in order to prevent injustice pending prompt congressional action on the requested extension. About 1,500,000 long-term unemployed workers throughout the country would be aided by such an extension; and it would give the Congress the opportunity to consider my proposals for permanent improvements promptly after it convenes in January, 1963.
