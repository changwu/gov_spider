    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 28 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3443, and the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill or any similar legislation.
The Department of Transportation has sufficient authority to ensure that airline operators are financially fit, and comply with U.S. citizenship requirements. H.R. 3443, on the other hand, would require that airline acquisitions be disapproved for reasons not directly related to safety or competition, and needlessly signal hostility to foreign investment in the airline industry.
