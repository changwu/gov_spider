    THE FEDERAL Criminal Code reflects our national growth. It has continuously been amended to meet new problems. However, this evolution has resulted in conflicting and overlapping criminal statutes. The entire Code is in dire need of comprehensive reform.
I have recently received the Report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, which was created in 1966 to make a thorough and complete review of the statutory and case laws constituting the Federal system of Criminal Justice. The Report provides a useful framework for considering the issues involved in reform of the Federal penal law.
Because reform of the Federal Criminal Code should be among the highest of' priorities of your Department, I am requesting you to take the following actions:
1. Establish a team of experienced attorneys within the Department of Justice to work full-time on a comprehensive reform of the Federal Criminal Code, and make sufficient deployment to that team of other personnel with specialized expertise.
2. Prepare a thorough evaluation of the Commission's Report.
3. Make an independent examination of the present Federal Criminal Code and recommendations for its comprehensive re form.
4. Carefully examine the recent address on the State of the Judiciary by the Chief Justice of the United States, and consider procedural as well as substantive areas of reform.
5. After the foregoing thorough analysis, prepare and submit appropriate legislation encompassing comprehensive reform of our Federal Criminal laws.
6. Work closely with appropriate Congressional committees and their staffs throughout your evaluation and recommendation process.
I would like to receive in six months a summary of your progress and your views concerning appropriate future action.
