    Chicago, IL -- In response to the statement issued by the Cleveland Clinic this evening confirming the passing of Ohio Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Senator Barack Obama made the following statement:
"Michelle and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. Stephanie was an extraordinary American and an outstanding public servant. It wasn't enough for her just to break barriers in her own life. She was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind â€” and in Stephanie, they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate. It was an honor to serve with Stephanie in Congress, and I know her legacy will live on in all those who walk the trails she blazed and walk through the doors she opened. Our hearts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved her," said Senator Obama.
