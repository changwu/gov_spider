    Whereas, section 10, title I, of Public No. 2, 73d Congress, entitled "An act to maintain the credit of the United States Government", provides:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2 of this title, any person who served as an officer of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps of the United States during the World War, other than as an officer of the Regular Army, Navy, or Marine Corps during the World War, who made valid application for retirement under the provisions of Public, No. 506, Seventieth Congress, enacted May 24, 1928, sections 581 and 582, title 38, United States Code, and who prior to the passage of this act has been granted retirement with pay, shall be entitled to continue to receive retirement pay at the monthly rate now being paid him if the disability for which he has been retired resulted from disease or injury or aggravation of a preexisting disease or injury incurred in line of duty during such service: Provided, That such person entered active service between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918: Provided, That the disease or injury or aggravation of the disease or injury directly resulted from the performance of military or naval duty, and that such person otherwise meets the requirements of the regulations which may be issued under the provisions of this act."
Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by said law the following regulation is hereby promulgated:
I. Any person who served as an officer of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps of the United States during the World War, other than as an officer of the Regular Army, Navy, or Marine Corps during the World War, who made valid application for retirement under the provisions of Public 506, 70th Congress, enacted May 24, 1928, sections 581 and 582, title 38, United States Code, and who prior to the passage of Public, No. 2, 73d Congress, has been granted retirement with pay, shall, subject to such other regulations as have been or may hereafter be issued, be entitled to continue to receive retirement pay at the monthly rate now being paid him if the disability for which he has been retired with pay resulted from disease or injury or aggravation of a preexisting disease or injury, incurred in line of duty during such service and is shown to have been heretofore properly rated: Provided That such person entered active service between April 6, 1917, and November 1, 1918: Provided further, That the disease or injury or aggravation of the disease or injury directly resulted from the performance of military or naval duty and that the causative factor therefor is shown to have arisen out of the performance of duty during such service.
