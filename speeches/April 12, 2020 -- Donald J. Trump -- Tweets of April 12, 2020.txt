A very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. We deployed 418 Doctors, Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC & State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good!Retweets: 31869Favorites: 170760

Great businessman & philanthropist Bernies Marcus, Co-Founder of Home Depot, said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminerRetweets: 1987Favorites: 1

The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!Retweets: 40028Favorites: 166188

Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation. What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It's a whole new ballgame over there!Retweets: 30394Favorites: 124199

If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump "ignored early warnings about the threat," then why did Media & Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said "early & not necessary." Corrupt Media!Retweets: 50131Favorites: 204931

The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, have put their political game plan in full swing. "Whether he is right or wrong, it doesn't matter. Criticize 'Trump' for everything, and don't let the public see Biden. Hide him."Retweets: 29626Favorites: 114023
