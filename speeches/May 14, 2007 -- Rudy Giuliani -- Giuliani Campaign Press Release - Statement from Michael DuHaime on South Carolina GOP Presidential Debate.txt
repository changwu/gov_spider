    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement today from Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime:
"Tonight it was clear there was only one candidate on the stage ready to be President of the United States. Mayor Rudy Giuliani's command of the issues and unifying, optimistic vision for the future of this country stood out in stark contrast â€” proving he is the strong leader these times demand. He will bring our Party and our country together to win the terrorists' war on us and keep our economy strong and growing."
