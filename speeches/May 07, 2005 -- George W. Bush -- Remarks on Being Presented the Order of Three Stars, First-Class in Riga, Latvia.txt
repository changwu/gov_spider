    Madam President, I gratefully accept. I am so honored and so thrilled to be here in your beautiful country.
I was telling the President that it's such a joy to come to a country that loves and values freedom and to be in the presence of a President who speaks so clearly about the need for people to be free and her recognition that a free world will yield peace.
And so, Madam President, thank you for your hospitality, and thank you so much for this great honor. Appreciate it.
