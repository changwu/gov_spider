The National Medal of Science was established in 1959 by the 86th Congress. It is presented to individuals who, in the judgement of the President, "are deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences." To date, 133 Medals have been awarded, beginning in 1962. Each President beginning with Kennedy has awarded Medals. President Carter presented the most recent awards on November 22, 1977.
The presentation of the award to the 1979 recipients will occur in the near future.
