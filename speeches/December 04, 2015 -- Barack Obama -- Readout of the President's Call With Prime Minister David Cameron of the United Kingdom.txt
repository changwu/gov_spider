    President Obama spoke today by phone with Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom to discuss Wednesday's vote in the British Parliament authorizing airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria. President Obama welcomed the outcome of the vote and expressed his appreciation that British air forces have joined with ours and those of other Coalition members in striking ISIL in Syria as well as in Iraq. The leaders discussed further steps that can be taken to degrade and destroy ISIL, and reiterated that all countries are welcome to join the existing Coalition, if their political and military objectives in Syria are consistent with those of the Coalition. They also discussed ways to further bolster our already robust counterterrorism cooperation, and the President, on behalf of the American people, accepted the Prime Minister's condolences for the loss of life in the San Bernardino shootings this week.
