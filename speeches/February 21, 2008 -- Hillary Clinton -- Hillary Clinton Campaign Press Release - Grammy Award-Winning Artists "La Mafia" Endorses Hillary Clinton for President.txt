    AUSTIN, TX - The Grammy Award-winning music group, "La Mafia," today announced their endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President.
"Throughout our 28-year career, we have never been involved in politics but we feel this election is the most important election in our lifetime," said Lead Vocalist Oscar De La Rosa. "We believe that Hillary's experience will help us pull out of our economic slump and feel she has a solid plan to solve the immigration issue, which is very close to our hearts. We do not have the luxury of inexperience in the White House for another eight years."
"Latinos, like never before, are playing a historic role in who becomes the Democratic nominee and who will most likely go on to win the White House," said Keyboardist Armando Lichtenberger Jr. "We want to ensure that Latinos here in Texas know how important it is to come out and vote early in the Texas primaries, and have their voices be heard."
"I am so pleased to have the support of such a popular music group that reaches out to all demographics and ages," Clinton said. "It is heartening to know that our message of change for our country is bringing out people who have never before been involved in politics. I look forward to working with them to spread our message of fixing the economy and restoring America's standing in the world."
"La Mafia" is a popular music group that has earned two Grammys, two Latin Grammys and six Premio Lo Nuestro Awards. The group has toured throughout the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. Additionally, the group has gone on USO tours to Kosovo, Bosnia, Germany, and the Netherlands.
The group will debut a new album in the summer of 2008 entitled, "El Mundo No Es Igual" (The World is Not the Same).
