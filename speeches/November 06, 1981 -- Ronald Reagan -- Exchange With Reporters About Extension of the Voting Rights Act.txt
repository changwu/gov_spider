    Q. How did you make the voting rights decision?
The President. I made it.
Q. I said "how." What made you come down in favor of the "bail out"?
The President. I came down in favor of a present, proved piece of legislation that has been most successful over the years and do think, however, after all this time, there could be the possibility of a better bail out opportunity for those who have abided by the election laws.
Q. Won't the blacks be angry at you?
Q. What year will we balance the budget?
The President. What?
Q. What year will we balance the budget now?
The President. I'll answer that further down the road.
Q. Won't the blacks be angry at you, sir?
The President. Why?
Q. Because you're supporting provisions that they oppose. For example, the intent provision.
The President. Well, I just think that the one that we have is tried and proven—
Q.—the aim of the Supreme Court. It isn't the tried and true. The tried and true is not the intent provision.
The President.—the voting rights for quite some time, and I think that it has worked and that it has resolved many of the problems.—
Q. Are you disappointed, sir, that the balanced budget seems out of reach?
The President. No, and if there may be some delay we'll know that later down the road. But that's still our goal, and we think this program will achieve it.
Q. Thank you.
