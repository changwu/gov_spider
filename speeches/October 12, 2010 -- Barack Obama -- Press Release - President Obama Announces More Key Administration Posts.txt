The Council will provide advice to the President on promoting and enhancing financial literacy and capability among the American people. This effort is important to help keep America competitive and assist the American people in understanding and addressing financial matters, which contributes to our national financial stability. The Council has been tasked with a number of charges, including advising the President on: financial education efforts; promoting financial products and services that are beneficial to consumers, especially low- and moderate-income consumers; and promoting understanding of effective use of such products and services.
The new Council is a part of President Obama's broader commitment to promote financial capability and protect American consumers. One of the central aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that President Obama recently signed into law is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the sole mission of which is protect and empower American consumers with the clear and concise information they need to make the financial decisions that are best for them and their families. The CFPB will house a new Office of Financial Education that will help educate and empower consumers to make better informed financial decisions. The President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability will play an important role in complementing these efforts. The President will announce additional members to this Committee at a later date.
