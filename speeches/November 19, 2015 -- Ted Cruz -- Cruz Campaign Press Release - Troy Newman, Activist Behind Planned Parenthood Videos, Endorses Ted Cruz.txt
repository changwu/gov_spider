HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz secured the endorsement of leading pro-life activist Troy Newman – a driving force in the recent effort to expose Planned Parenthood's alleged sale of baby parts in a series of undercover videos. Newman is the President of Operation Rescue, one of the most prominent pro-life Christian activist organizations in the nation. He also serves as a Board Member for a number of pro-life groups including the Center for Medical Progress. In addition, Troy is the author of several books, including Refocusing the Pro-Life Movement for Victory and Abortion Free.
"I am grateful to receive the endorsement of Troy Newman," Cruz said. "He has served as a voice for the unborn for over 25 years, and works tirelessly every day for the pro-life cause. We need leaders like Troy Newman in this country who will stand up for those who do not have a voice."
"There are many people of extraordinary integrity running for President in 2016. And there are many candidates who are strongly pro-life. But when I look at the field of contenders, one man stands out as exceptional," said Newman. "One man rises above the pack in his willingness to always tell the truth and do what he said he would do—on life and on every issue that matters to social conservatives. That man is Ted Cruz.
"I'm enthusiastically endorsing Ted Cruz for President because I know he will consistently and meaningfully fight for the unborn and always stand strong for decency and responsibility in our government and across our nation," Newman continued. "I encourage anyone who shares these values and who wants a proven, trusted fighter as our president to also endorse Ted Cruz for President."
Since the Roe V. Wade decision in January of 1973, over 55 million lives have been lost due to abortion.
