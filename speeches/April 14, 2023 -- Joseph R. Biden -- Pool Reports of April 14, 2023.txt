A primer on President Biden's ancestors from County Mayo:

Patrick Blewitt and Catherine Scanlon – (President Biden's Great-Great-Grandparents)

Patrick was born on April 5th, 1832 in Ballina, County Mayo, Ireland.
Patrick was educated in Ireland and was well versed in civil engineering and surveying.
In 1857 he married Catherine Scanlon, who was born around 1840 in Ireland (county unknown).
Catherine was the daughter of Anthony and Honora Scanlon who was stationed in Killala Bay, County Mayo.


Edward Blewitt / Bluet and Mary Mulderg "Reddington" (President Biden's Great-Great-Great-Grandparents)

Edward Blewitt was born around 1803 in Ireland and resided in County Mayo.
By 1848 Edward served as the head overseer in the Ballina Poor Law Union.
The Ballina Dispensary is the only part of the workhouse complex that is still standing.
Edward and his wife Mary immigrated to the United States on the Excelsior in January of 1851 (they landed in New York).
Upon his arrival in Pennsylvania, he assisted in the planning and layout of the city of Scranton, the sister city to Ballina, County Mayo.


Present-day relatives in Ballina

The President has several distant family members who live in Ballina, including Brendan Blewitt, and his children Joe, Laurita, the President's third cousins. Brendan's daughter Catherina now lives stateside.
When the 2020 election was called for President Biden, people in Ballina - including the President's cousins -celebrated his win, with American flags, posters, and more.
