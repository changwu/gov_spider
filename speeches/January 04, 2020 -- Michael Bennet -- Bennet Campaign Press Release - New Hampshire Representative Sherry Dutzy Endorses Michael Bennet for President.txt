    NASHUA â€” New Hampshire State Rep. Sherry Dutzy today endorsed Michael Bennet for President of the United States. Dutzy has represented the Hillsborough 30 district since 2018. She serves on the Committee on Environment and Agriculture.
"Michael Bennet has the ideas, the experience, and the perspective to beat Donald Trump and deliver for the next generation on day one," said Dutzy. "His progressive, pragmatic plan to enlist American farmers in the fight against climate change will prove that we don't have to choose between a healthy planet and a strong economy. I'll be voting for him in February, and I urge all my neighbors and constituents in Nashua to do the same."
Bennet represents Colorado in the Senate, but he has not spent a lifetime in politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. Bennet is the only candidate in this race who has won two elections in a swing state. He has released comprehensive, field-leading proposals, including to provide high-quality, affordable health care with a public option, reward hard work, fix our broken political system, and tackle climate change by working with our farmers and ranchers.
