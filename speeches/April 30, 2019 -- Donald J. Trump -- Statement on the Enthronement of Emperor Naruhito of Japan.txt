    The First Lady and I send our most profound congratulations on behalf of all Americans to Their Majesties the Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako on his enthronement as the new Emperor of Japan. As the Japanese people embark upon a new era, "Reiwa," we will renew the strong bonds of friendship between our two countries. "Reiwa" means "beautiful harmony," and it is our sincere wish that our alliance continue to flourish and deepen in this spirit. Today our kindest thoughts are with the Japanese people, and we share in the hope for an even brighter future.
