    On behalf of the American people, I extend my best wishes to all those who are observing Serbian National Day. The United States and Serbia share an important partnership based on mutual respect and shared goals. Here in America, those of Serbian descent contribute to the fabric of American life. I look forward to a continued friendship between our two countries.
