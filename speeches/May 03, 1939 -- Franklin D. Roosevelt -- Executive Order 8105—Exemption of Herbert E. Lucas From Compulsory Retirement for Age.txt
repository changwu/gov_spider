    Whereas, in my judgment, the public interest requires that Herbert E. Lucas, special agent, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Treasury Department, who, during the current month, will reach the retirement age prescribed for automatic separation from the service, applicable to him, be exempted from compulsory retirement for age for a period of one year:
Now, Therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 382, 404 (U.S.C., title 5, sec.Â 715a), I hereby exempt the said Herbert E. Lucas from compulsory retirement for age for a period of one year ending May 31, 1940.
