Travel pool report #3 - Grand Prince hotel arrival
The motorcade arrived at 10:37 am JST after an uneventful ride. It's a sunny 73 degrees here in Hiroshima.
Pool was escorted inside the hotel but did not see POTUS before we left the motorcade. We're now holding in a conference room.
*Your pooler regrets that she has labeled the first two pool reports as "in town" instead of "travel." My sincere apologies.

Travel pool report #4 - Family photo/debt talks update
Pool was not given access to the family photo ahead of the working session on Ukraine, but spotted POTUS on the pool feed. He was flanked by Japanese PM Kishida and German Chancellor Scholz. Ukrainian President Zelensky stood between Kishida and French President Macron. As they walked in before posing for the photo, POTUS put his arm around Zelensky.
From a White House official:President Biden has continued to closely track negotiations on a bipartisan budget framework and the pressing need for Congress to act to avert default. He received an update from his team both last night and this morning on the status of negotiations. The President directed his team to coordinate with Speaker McCarthy to schedule a call for Sunday morning ET following his meetings at the G7.

Travel pool report #7 - News: official trilat invite
POTUS, Kishida and Yoon arrived on the patio at 1:42 pm JST. They stood on the riser and posed for photos. They shook hands and spoke for a minute before leaving.
During their conversation, POTUS invited both leaders for an official trilateral meeting in the US. No date yet but they're working out the details, per a senior administration official.
Asked what his message to Speaker McCarthy, POTUS said he would be speaking with him later today. When pressed on his message, POTUS said I'm going to give it to him before I'll give it to you.
Pool will listen back for exact quote.
We were ushered out at 1:48pm JST.

Travel report #8 - gaggle with a administration official
Pool spoke on background to a senior administration official for about 14 minutes before POTUS' meeting with Zelensky. The official gave a recap of the summit and took questions on China's response to the communique, whether the debt ceiling came up with foreign leaders and the outbound investments executive order. They have not heard directly from China on the language in the communique.
No news to share and your pooler will send another report with exact quotes.
The official said the summit was a step on the path of turning the IRA from "source of friction" to a "source of affirmative unity and strength."
We're now holding outside the room where POTUS will meet with Zelensky.

"But for today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing."
Pool was ushered out at 2:50.

Travel pool report #10 - More from Zelensky meeting
There seemed to be some confusion about whether Zelensky confirmed Russia had taken control of Bakhmut. The AP's Zeke Miller asked whether Bakhmut was still in Ukraine's hands. The Russians say they've taken Bakhmut.
Zelensky appeared to answer the first question. "I think no. But you have to understand there is nothing."
"For today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts."
When pool first entered the room, POTUS spoke first.
He announced the "next tranche of US factories which includes more ammunition, artillery, vehicles. And the United States continues to help Ukraine respond, recover and rebuild. We're also supporting peace."

Travel pool report #11 - More Zelensky meeting
The audio is difficult to hear so again, please check against the transcript.
The POTUS quote should be: "Today, I'm announcing the next tranche of US [inaudible], which includes more ammunition, artillery, armored vehicles."
"The United States continue to help Ukraine respond, recover and rebuild."
"Together with the entire G7, we have Ukraine's back and we're not going anywhere," POTUS said.
Zelensky thanked POTUS for his leadership and support. He said there are "strong relations" between the two countries, and they stand shoulder to shoulder. He thanked the American people, POTUS and his team - specifically naming Sullivan and Blinken, who were seated to the left of the president.
POTUS recalled when air raid sirens went off during his trip to Kyiv. As they walked, the sirens blared and he looked at Zelensky. He said Zelensky wasn't worried, so he wasn't. The room laughed.
We're now holding in vans outside the hotel.



May 21, 202315:58 JST

Travel pool report #12 - Rolling
We're now rolling for the RON at 3:55 JST.

We have a dinner lid until 5:45 pm JST.



May 21, 202316:53 JST

Travel pool report #14 - Bakhmut question
Since there's a lot of interest in what Zelensky was asked, here is what was asked and what we were able to pull from the audio:
Q: Mr. President, President Zelensky, is Bakhmut still in Ukraine's hands? The Russians say they have taken Bakhmut.
A: "I think no. But you have to understand that there is nothing. They destroyed everything. There are no [buildings?] [inaudible] For today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts. there is nothing in this place. Just [ground?] and a lot of dead Russians. But they came to us. Our defenders in Bakhmut, they did strong work. And of course, we appreciate that [inaudible] great job."

The president's helicopter settled onto the South Lawn on a perfect spring night in Washington at 2236, ending his Asia trip early to deal with the approaching debt ceiling deadline.
President Biden, clad in khakis and a blue jacket, emerged from the forward door of Marine 1 two minutes later, walked across the grass and past the pool reporters waiting by the South Portico entrance.
In réponse to a shouted question about his earlier phone call with Speaker McCarthy, he said: "It went well, we'll talk tomorrow."
He entered the building at 2239, as First Dog Commander looked on from the Truman Balcony.
