    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the International Telecommunication Regulations, with appendices, signed at Melbourne on December 9, 1988, with a statement, including a reservation. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Regulations.
The International Telecommunication Regulations (Melbourne, 1988) replace the Telegraph Regulations and the Telephone Regulations (Geneva, 1973), to which the United States is a party.
The International Telecommunication Regulations provide suitably neutral and flexible guidelines for international telecommunication networks and services offered to the public. The Regulations are in the public and commercial interest of the United States.
The International Telecommunication Regulations entered into force on July 1, 1990, among states that have notified the Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union of their adherence.
I believe that the United States should become a party to the International Telecommunication Regulations, and it is my hope that the Senate will take timely action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
George Bush
The White House,
September 11, 1991.
