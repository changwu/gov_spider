    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/30/92)(House Rules)(Schumer (D) New York and 96 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 4542. To minimize costs for consumers (estimated at $210 million annually), the Administration prefers Titles II and III as reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Administration would support an amendment providing for tougher penalties for "carjacking" in aggravated cases, such as those involving kidnapping or murder.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4542 would increase receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 4542 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
