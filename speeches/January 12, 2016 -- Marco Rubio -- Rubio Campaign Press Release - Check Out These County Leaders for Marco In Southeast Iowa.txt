Today, the Marco Rubio for President campaign announced Iowans from the Southeast part of the state that will be serving as county leaders helping to share Marco's message and caucusing for him on February 1.
The announcement today comes as Marco's momentum in the Hawkeye state continues to grow. With three weeks until the caucuses, Marco's message is resonating with voters at the right time. It is a message that will allow Marco to compete in all of Iowa's 99 counties.
"Marco Rubio's national security experience makes him the right choice for Southeast Iowa," said State Rep. Bobby Kaufmann. "He was ahead of the curve in calling for stronger policies to combat ISIS and all forms of terrorism around the globe. In these dangerous times we need Marco Rubio's proven judgment in the White House."
"I endorse Marco Rubio because I want a president who understands the challenges facing Iowa families," said Alan Ostergren, President of Iowa County Attorneys Association. "Marco's humble roots help him connect with voters; particularly those who are struggling to get ahead in this economy. Marco Rubio knows we need new leadership, new ideas, and less power in Washington if we want to get this country back on track."
