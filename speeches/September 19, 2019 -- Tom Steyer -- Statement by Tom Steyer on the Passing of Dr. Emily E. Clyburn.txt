    (SAN FRANCISCO, September 19, 2019) â€” Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the statement below following the passing of Dr. Emily E. Clyburn:
"Today, my heart and prayers are with Rep. Jim Clyburn and his family. America and South Carolinians have lost a true warrior and activist. Dr. Emily Clyburn built a legacy of advocating for children and youth for many years. Driven by her passion for reading, she humbly dedicated her life's work to literacy and education, while offering disadvantaged youth the opportunity to attend college through scholarships. Dr. Clyburn's passion and advocacy remind me of my own mother, who is an inspiration to me. As we honor her life and legacy, I will continue to fight for equal opportunity for more young people and South Carolinians. Let's celebrate, and grow from her many contributions. May God's comfort and infinite peace be with Rep. Clyburn, his daughters, and grandchildren during this difficult time."
