    37 elected officials from Illinois's 10th Congressional District endorse Biden ahead of March 17 primary
Today, Congressman Brad Schneider and 37 elected officials and community leaders representing Illinois's Tenth Congressional District announced their enthusiastic support for Joe Biden ahead of the Illinois primary on Tuesday, March 17.
While some, including Schneider, already publicly endorsed Biden, others previously supported other candidates in the primary and some had not yet made any decision. Yet all are now united in their choice of Joe Biden as the best candidate to lead our party and nation in 2020.
"We need a leader who will restore America's standing in the world, fight for working families, and bring our country together. Joe Biden is that candidate, and there is strong enthusiasm for his campaign across the Tenth Congressional District. There is more at stake in 2020 than just defeating President Trump - we also need a nominee who will unite our party, take back the Senate, defend our House majority, and lead us to Democratic victories in crucial down ballot races as well. I am proud to stand alongside so many community leaders and local elected officials to support Joe Biden's campaign here in Illinois," said Schneider.
