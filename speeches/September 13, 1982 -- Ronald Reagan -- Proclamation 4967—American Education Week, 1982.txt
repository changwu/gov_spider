  A Proclamation

The wisdom and foresight of our Founding Fathers set in motion the greatness of America and the personal liberties we enjoy today. These blessings have thrived because of the value succeeding generations have placed on knowledge and education. For this reason alone, few matters are as critical to the future of our country than the continued success of our educational system.
Part of our national strength is the fact that parents have the right to oversee their children's education. While our states provide public schools and state and local educators assist parents in achieving educational goals, it is clearly the right and duty of parents to supervise these functions. Our tax system should ensure that effective parental choice in education is not the preserve of only the wealthy.
The timely theme for American Education Week this year is "A Strong Nation Needs Strong Schools." Every American should take this theme to heart and give renewed support to our schools, be they public, private, or synagogue or church-affiliated. Strong community support results in effective schools. Effective schools help assure that our democratic society will flourish.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning November 14, 1982, and the second week of November of each succeeding year, as American Education Week.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 13th. day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
