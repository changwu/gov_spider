Monday on MSNBC, Republican presidential candidate and former Gov. George Pataki (R-NY), said that his rival Donald Trump blaming former President George W. Bush for the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks is "like an eighth-grade schoolyard bully spewing nonsense."
Pataki said, "Donald Trump is like an eighth-grade schoolyard bully spewing nonsense. 'I would have stopped September 11 if I was president. I'll beat China. I'll make Mexico build and pay for a wall.' This is all complete nonsense. And more than that, you wonder why all of a sudden he's going after Bush when it was Clintonâ€”the Clintons had been in power for eight years before September 11. So I don't know what he's doing. I just think it makes it plain that this man is not someone who should be president."
He continued, "This is Trump spewing nonsense. Whether it's Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)is not a war hero or Mexico's going to pay for the wall, or now today if his immigration policy had been in effect, September 11 might not have happened. He just continually says things that make it plain that this man is not fit to be president of the United States. But it makes you wonder why going after Bush as opposed to the Clintons, who were in power for eight years. What is he really thinking here? I don't know."
