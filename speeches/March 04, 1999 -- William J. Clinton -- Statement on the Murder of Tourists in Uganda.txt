    I was deeply saddened to learn of the brutal violence that erupted Monday morning in a nature preserve in southwestern Uganda. Hillary and I have extended our profound condolences to the families of the victims.
Eight innocent tourists from the United States, Great Britain, and New Zealand were killed. All of the victims were there because they loved Africa. It was a senseless and cowardly murder, apparently committed by those who perpetrated the Rwandan genocide in 1994. If this attack was intended as a warning to our Nation to stop supporting those in the region seeking reconciliation and justice, those who committed it should understand that we will not be deterred in any way.
We will not forget these crimes, nor rest until those who committed them are brought to justice. Already, a team of FBI experts is on the ground, working with Ugandan authorities to gather the relevant evidence so indictments of the perpetrators can be made.
Let me also underscore our commitment to breaking the cycle of violence and impunity that has gripped the Great Lakes region, so that all who live in and visit the region can do so without fear.
