    Today, President Donald J. Trump made additional disaster assistance available to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken in the Commonwealth as a result of Hurricane Maria during the period beginning on September 17, 2017, and continuing.
On September 27, 2017, President Trump authorized a 100 percent Federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, for 180 days from the date of the declaration.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, except for assistance previously approved at 100 percent. Recognizing the Commonwealth's election to participate in alternative procedures authorized under section 428 of the Stafford Act, the President has authorized assistance conditioned upon having extra controls on project cost estimation and project management in place to facilitate the expeditious rebuilding of Puerto Rico's infrastructure, to allow for cost-effective activities that reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, or suffering from a major disaster, and to ensure sound stewardship of Federal tax dollars.
