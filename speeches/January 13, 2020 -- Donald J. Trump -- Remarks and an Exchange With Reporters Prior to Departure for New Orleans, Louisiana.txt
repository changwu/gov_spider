    The President. So we're going to the game. It will be a great game. It will be something that a lot of people want to see. And we'll be in New Orleans, and we look forward to it.
The stock market—way up. The country is doing really well. And we'll see you at the game.
Death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Major General and Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani 
Q. Mr. President, what did the intelligence show about the threat to the four Embassies? What did the intelligence show?
The President. Well, first of all, I think it's been totally consistent. But here's what's been consistent: We killed Soleimani, the number-one terrorist in the world by every account. Bad person. Killed a lot of Americans, killed a lot of people. We killed him. And when the Democrats try and defend him, it's a disgrace to our country. They can't do that. And, let me tell you, it's not working politically very well for them.
So we killed the number-one terrorist in the world—Soleimani—and it should have been done 20 years ago.
We'll see you at the game. Thank you.
