    Ed Gillespie has done an outstanding job as chairman of the Republican National Committee. He helped bring many new people to our cause by sharing our vision of a safer world and more hopeful America. His successful efforts in outreach, registration, and voter turnout will be an enduring legacy on which to build a long-lasting governing coalition.
Republicans now hold the Presidency, majorities in both Houses of Congress, and the majority of governorships and State legislatures. That's due to a lot of hard work by many people, and one of the most important contributions has been the personal commitment, creativity, and leadership of Ed Gillespie these past years.
I thank Ed for his exceptional service and friendship and wish him and Cathy all the best.
