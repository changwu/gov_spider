    Huge turnout at four town hall meetings in Eastern Iowa's rural areas and large population centers
ANKENY, Iowa — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted sizable crowds at all four events held on the first day of his two-day, far-reaching visit to Eastern Iowa today.
Paul's Lee County event, held in Fort Madison, yielded 225 people. His noon Henry County event in Mount Pleasant and his Washington County event in Washington attracted more than 200 people each. Paul's Quad Cities event in Bettendorf yielded a remarkable more than 800 people.

Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) surveys the over-capacity crowd of more than 800 at his Quad Cities Town Hall Meeting in Bettendorf, the fourth event of its kind on the first of a two-day visit.
"The first day of Ron Paul's visit gave us another glimpse into what a Paul presidency would look like, with voters asking how this re-acquaintance with economic and personal liberty would affect 'me' during the transition. We hope Dr. Paul's promotion of this philosophy, his 'Plan to Restore America,' and his candor is contributing to an atmosphere conducive to a strong top-three showing at the January caucus," said Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers.
The abovementioned appearances are listed in the order they occurred, and each event was a town hall meeting featuring a speech and Q.&A.
