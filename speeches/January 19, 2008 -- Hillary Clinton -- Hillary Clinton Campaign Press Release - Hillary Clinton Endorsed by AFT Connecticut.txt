    Union That Previously Supported Senator Dodd's Campaign Wants a Proven Leader in the White House
Rocky Hill - Continuing to build on the growing momentum in Connecticut and throughout the February 5th states, Hillary Clinton today received the endorsement of the AFT Connecticut at a volunteer event in the AFT headquarters. AFT CT previously supported Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd.
In endorsing Hillary, AFT Connecticut President Sharon Palmer praised the $110 billion economic stimulus that Hillary introduced earlier this month. Her plan provides tax rebates to middle class families, assists families with skyrocketing energy costs, invests in clean energy technology and supports workers who have lost their jobs.
"Our members have told us that they want a leader they can trust to jumpstart our economy, protect the middle class, create jobs, and increase access to affordable, quality healthcare," said Sharon Palmer, president of AFT Connecticut. "Hillary Clinton is that leader."
The AFT Connecticut endorsement activates the union's considerable member education and political mobilization program on behalf of the endorsed candidate. AFT Connecticut will put in motion a grass-roots campaign to engage its members throughout the state to help nominate Hillary Clinton.
"I'm honored to have the support of the hardworking men and women of AFT Connecticut," said Clinton. "As President, I am going to work everyday to ensure that the working families of Connecticut, who are being left behind in this economy, will no longer be invisible."
AFT Connecticut is the state's second largest AFL-CIO union representing more than 28,000 professionals, including healthcare, higher education, public employees, paraprofessionals and school related personnel, and teachers.
