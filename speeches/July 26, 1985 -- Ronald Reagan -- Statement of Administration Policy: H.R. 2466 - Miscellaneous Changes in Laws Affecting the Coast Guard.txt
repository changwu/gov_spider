    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and 3 others)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2466 unless it is amended to delete the following objectionable provisions which would:
— prohibit the Coast Guard from contracting out certain aids to navigation functions, thereby preventing the accomplishment of these functions in the most cost-effective manner (Section 5) ;
— exempt certain Coast Guard organizational units from statutory and administrative personnel ceilings through September 30, 1988 (Section 3). This exemption is contrary to sound personnel management practices, and would have a deleterious effect on the efficient management of the Coast Guard's personnel force;
— make the otherwise ineligible Port of Houston Authority Bridge eligible for retroactive reimbursement, up to $450,000, for the alteration of the bridge (Section 10); and
— extend for five years the current exemption from certain fire safety requirements for the paddlewheel riverboat, the Delta Queen (Section 1(7)), which should not be extended in the interest of maritime and passenger safety.
With respect to the "National Offshore Vessel Operators Safety Advisory Committee" that would be established by Section 7 of H.R. 2446, the Administration believes that the requirement for the Secretary of Transportation to consult with the Committee on the promulgation of safety regulations should be narrowed.
Instead of requiring consultation before "promulgating any regulations or orders affecting the safety of such offshore operations," the consultation should be limited to the "promulgation of final regulations or orders significantly affecting" such operations.
The Administration urges, therefore, that H.R. 2466 be removed from the suspension calendar and amended accordingly.
