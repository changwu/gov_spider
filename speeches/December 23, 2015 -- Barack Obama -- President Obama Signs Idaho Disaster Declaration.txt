    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Idaho and ordered federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the area affected by a severe storm and straight-line winds on November 17, 2015.
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storm and straight-line winds in the counties of Benewah, Bonner, Boundary, and Kootenai and the Coeur d'Alene Tribe.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures in all areas within the state.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. Dargan as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
