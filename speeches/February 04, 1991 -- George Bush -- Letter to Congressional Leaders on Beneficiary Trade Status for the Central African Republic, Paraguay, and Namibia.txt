    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add the Central African Republic, Paraguay, and Namibia to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act").
The Central African Republic and Paraguay previously had their GSP eligibility suspended as a result of determinations that they had not and were not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to workers in their countries, as required by section 502(b)(7) of the 1974 Act. As a result of reviews completed to consider recent changes in law and practice in the Central African Republic and Paraguay, I have now determined that both countries meet the worker rights standard of the law and are otherwise eligible to have their GSP benefits reinstated.
Namibia became an independent nation on March 21, 1990. I have determined that Namibia meets the eligibility standards of the GSP law and that it is appropriate to designate Namibia as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
George Bush
