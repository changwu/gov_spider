The Dispatch urges Republican voters to vote for Gov. John Kasich in Tuesday's Republican Primary.
While The Dispatch typically does not endorse candidates in a primary, this one is unique, given the alarming ascent of Trump, whose demeanor and reckless policy prescriptions make him unsuitable as a presidential nominee, much less president. If implemented, Trump's policies would lead to a devastating international trade war; create a human-rights crisis in the attempt to deport millions of people living in the country illegally; alienate nations otherwise friendly to the United States, such as Mexico; aggravate religious intolerance domestically and globally; and empower thugs such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Trump admires. (The Democratic primary is a more conventional race and the newspaper has no reason to change its customary hands-off approach to it.)
Of those remaining in the GOP race, Kasich is unrivaled for his pragmatism and track record. He has refused to get into the mud with his rivals and consistently has taken the high road by trying to focus the race on the ability to make government work, a skill he has demonstrated as a member of Congress and governor of Ohio. He would be a formidable candidate for president against whoever emerges as the Democratic contender.
