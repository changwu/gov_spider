    More than 6 weeks have passed since the tsunami took over 150,000 lives in one of the world's worst natural disasters. Thanks to the immediate and effective response of the U.S. military and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States, working with other members of the international community, was able to prevent additional loss of life and to deliver relief to those in need.
I will seek $950 million as part of the supplemental appropriations request to support the areas recovering from the tsunami and to cover the costs of relief efforts to date. This amount includes an additional $600 million above my initial commitment of $350 million. We will use these resources to provide assistance and to work with the affected nations on rebuilding vital infrastructure that reenergizes economies and strengthens societies.
I appreciate the efforts of former Presidents Bush and Clinton to raise private donations in the United States, and we are grateful to all of those who have donated money to help those in need.
