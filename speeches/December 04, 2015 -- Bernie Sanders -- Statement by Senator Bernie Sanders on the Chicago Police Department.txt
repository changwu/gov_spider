    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Friday in response to calls for a federal investigation into the practices of the Chicago Police Department:
"I join with those calling for a federal investigation into the practices of the Chicago Police Department. Furthermore, any official who helped suppress the videotape of Laquan McDonald's murder should be held accountable. And any elected official with knowledge that the tape was being suppressed or improperly withheld should resign. No one should be shielded by power or position."
