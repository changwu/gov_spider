    On behalf of the United States, I am issuing an appeal today to all countries to join in an international humanitarian effort to help the victims of the conflict in Lebanon. As part of that effort, I am today asking Congress to provide $20 million in relief and rehabilitation assistance for Lebanon.
In the meantime, we are making available immediately an additional $5 million in emergency assistance for foodstuffs, shelter, medicines, and other critically needed relief supplies.
