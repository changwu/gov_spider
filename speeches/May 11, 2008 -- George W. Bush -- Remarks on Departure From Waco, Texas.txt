    Laura and I want to wish everybody a happy Mother's Day. It's just a special day for—to give thanks to our moms, to appreciate the hard work that moms do. And I understand that for some, however, Mother's Day is a sad day for those who lost their lives in Oklahoma and Missouri and Georgia because of the tornadoes—are wondering whether or not tomorrow will be a bright and hopeful day.
We send our prayers to those who lost their lives, the families of those who lost their lives. And the Federal Government will be moving hard to help. I'll be in touch with the Governors to offer all the Federal assistance we can.
This Mother's Day weekend was awfully special for Laura and me. Our little girl Jenna married a really good guy, Henry Hager. The wedding was spectacular. It's just—it's all we could have hoped for. The weather was—cooperated nicely, and just as the vows were exchanged, the sun set over our lake. And it was just a special day and a wonderful day, and we're mighty blessed.
Anyway, thank you all.
