    The United States condemns the killing of Laurent DuPasquier, an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) staff member, caused by shelling yesterday near the organization's premises in Donetsk, Ukraine. We extend our sympathies and condolences to Mr. DuPasquier's family, friends, and colleagues. We urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and ensure that its protections are afforded to the ICRC and other humanitarian organizations, which are providing impartial and much-needed aid to civilians in Ukraine, just as these groups do in so many other conflicts worldwide. We call on all parties to the conflict to protect the civilians in their midst and hold accountable those who engage in the indiscriminate use of force. We express our ongoing appreciation to the ICRC and other humanitarians around the world who put themselves in harm's way to ease the suffering of war.
