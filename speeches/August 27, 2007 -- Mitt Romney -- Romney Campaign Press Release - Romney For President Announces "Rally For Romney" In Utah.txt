Boston, MA - Today, Romney for President announced the launch of "Rally for Romney" in Utah. Rally for Romney is a new nationwide grassroots fundraising initiative designed to mobilize and empower volunteers across the country to build support at the grassroots level.
The goal of Rally for Romney is to empower grassroots activists nationwide to call friends and family that are not yet supporting Governor Romney's campaign and turn them into active supporters by asking them to make a contribution.
Rally for Romney recruitment has begun in more than 40 cities, in 21 states, culminating with "Call Rallies" in those cities and states at the end of September. Governor Romney's son, Josh Romney, has spoken about the program and has helped unveil Rally for Romney in other locations (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbiA40diS0).
The Rally in Salt Lake City will take place at the Salt Lake Convention Center on September 28 from 2:00 PM â€“ 8:00 PM. Utahans interested in participating in Rally for Romney should call 801-961-4070 for more information or visit www.MittRomney.com/Rally.
Rally for Romney eliminates the high-dollar attendance barrier of typical fundraising events and gives supporters the ability to come together and form a "fundraising team." Each team will set a fundraising goal and work together to meet the goal before or during the Rally in their city. Recruitment for team captains and team members begin today in Utah.
Romney for President Finance Director Spencer Zwick said, " Rally for Romney will help us continue to raise the resources we need to compete nationwide, and give people the opportunity to show their support of Governor Romney and his message of conservative change in Washington."
Romney for President Political Director Carl Forti said, "The launch of Rally for Romney is just the latest effort that Governor Romney's campaign has undertaken to mobilize and energize supporters in new and innovative ways. Rally for Romney will help us reach out to more voters and engage them in Governor Romney's campaign at a grassroots level."
