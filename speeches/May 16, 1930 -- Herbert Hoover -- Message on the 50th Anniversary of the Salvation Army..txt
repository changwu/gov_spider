My dear Commander Booth:
The fiftieth anniversary of your work and that of the Salvation Army in the United States is not only an occasion for congratulations to you, which I cordially extend, but to the country as a whole which has so largely benefitted by the humanitarian activities and high ideals which you and the Army have consistently advanced. I am sure the heart of the country goes out to you in spontaneous gratitude and good wishes.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Miss Evangeline Booth, Commander-in-Chief of the Salvation Army Forces, New York City ]
