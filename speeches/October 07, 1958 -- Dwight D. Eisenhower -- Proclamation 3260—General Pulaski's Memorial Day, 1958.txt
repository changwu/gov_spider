  A Proclamation

Whereas during the war for American independence brave men from across the seas left their homelands to fight by our side for the cause of liberty; and
Whereas one of the most valiant of these warriors was Casimir Pulaski, a Polish count who, after distinguishing himself in several encounters, died at the age of thirty-one from a wound received while leading a cavalry attack to relieve the city of Savannah; and
Whereas October 11, 1958, is the one hundred and seventy-ninth anniversary of the death of this youthful foe of tyranny, whose ideals and selfless purpose set a glorious example to all men who are willing to give their strength for freedom; and
Whereas it is fitting that we should mark this anniversary with ceremonies designed to honor this gallant Pole, who attained the rank of Brigadier General in our Continental Army:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 11, 1958, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite our people to observe the day with suitable manifestations of respect for the memory of General Casimir Pulaski and for the cause which commanded his allegiance.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
