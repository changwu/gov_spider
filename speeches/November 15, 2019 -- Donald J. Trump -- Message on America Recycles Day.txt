    America Recycles Day is an opportunity to recognize the importance of recycling to our Nation's economy and environment. Reducing waste protects our natural resources, supports manufacturing, and preserves the extraordinary beauty of our country, and it can provide remarkable economic opportunities for our citizens.
Each year, the United States produces nearly 263 million tons of municipal solid waste. While this number has increased over the years, so have the efforts of our citizenry and industry to enhance environmental stewardship. Approximately 68 million tons of municipal solid waste are recycled annually, representing a steady increase over the last 50 years. Contributing to this recycling effort, in 2018, the Federal Government diverted more than 50 percent of waste from its operations to recycling and recovery, rather than to landfills.
The United States continues to be a world leader in commerce while also setting the global standard in reducing waste. Through American ingenuity and innovation, we will continue to seek ways to harness our Nation's entrepreneurial spirit and promote recycling activities that support economic growth and environmental protection. On America Recycles Day, we reaffirm our commitment to building a more prosperous and innovative nation.
