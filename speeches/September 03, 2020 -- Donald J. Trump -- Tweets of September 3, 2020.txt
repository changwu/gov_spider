My Administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses. We're putting them on notice today. @RussVought45Retweets: 47048Favorites: 189868

Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York has the worst record on death and China Virus. 11,000 people alone died in Nursing Homes because of his incompetence!Retweets: 43532Favorites: 178426

Sleepy Joe Hiden' was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation, H1N1 Swine Flu. The OBiden Administration failed badly on this, & now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the China Virus. DOING GREAT JOB! https://t.co/p2H40mD7ShRetweets: 18518Favorites: 66158

.@NYGovCuomo should get his puppet New York prosecutors, who have been illegally after me and my family for years, to investigate his incompetent handling of the China Virus, and all of the deaths caused by this incompetence. It is at minimum a Nursing Home Scandal - 11,000 DEAD!Retweets: 33735Favorites: 116321

....after you Vote, which it should not, that Ballot will not be used or counted in that your vote has already been cast & tabulated. YOU ARE NOW ASSURED THAT YOUR PRECIOUS VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED, it hasn't been "lost, thrown out, or in any way destroyed". GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!Retweets: 0Favorites: 0

.....go to your Polling Place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been Tabulated (Counted). If it has you will not be able to Vote & the Mail In System worked properly. If it has not been Counted, VOTE (which is a citizen's right to do). If your Mail In Ballot arrives....Retweets: 0Favorites: 0

Based on the massive number of Unsolicited & Solicited Ballots that will be sent to potential Voters for the upcoming 2020 Election, & in order for you to MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE COUNTS & IS COUNTED, SIGN & MAIL IN your Ballot as EARLY as possible.

Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was "set up" by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn't wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP?Retweets: 41486Favorites: 187578

Nancy Pelosi says she got "set up" by a Beauty Parlor owner. Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy?Retweets: 55658Favorites: 276019

Hearing that Iran is looking to execute a great and popular wrestling star, 27-year-old Navid Afkarai, whose sole act was an anti-government demonstration on the streets. They were protesting the "country's worsening economic situation and inflation"...Retweets: 29129Favorites: 105437

Joe Hiden' get off his airplane, grabs and shakes a rather stunned man's hand (like in the old days), then touches his (Joe's) face and mask with the same hand. No crowd, no enthusiasm for Joe today. Law & Order!Retweets: 1807Favorites: 6243
