    Hillary and I were heartbroken to hear this weekend of the 13 people killed when a tourist boat sank in my hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas. I know Lake Hamilton well, and I am terribly saddened that this beautiful lake has become the site of such a tragedy. I commend all those Hot Springs residents who worked courageously to save lives in the moments after the sinking. Hillary and I send our thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathies to all those families mourning their loved ones. As it is written in the Bible, God "will not in any way fail you, nor give you up, nor leave you without support."
