In-Town Pool Report #4: Remarks Ends
POTUS promised that if Democrats control the Congress next year, he will work to codify abortion rights.
"Here is the promise I make to you and the American people, the first bill I'll send to Congress is to codify Roe v Wade," he said.
Earlier in his speech, Biden said that, in Dobbs, SCOTUS "practically dared" women to turn out and vote. He predicted that those voters would turn out in support of Democrats.
He reiterated his argument that the Dobbs case endangers other established rights like gay marriage and access to contraception.
He said of Sen. Lindsey Graham's proposed abortion ban that, if it ever makes it to his desk, "I'll veto it."
He mentioned also his infrastructure bill, gun control, student debt amnesty, and marijuana pardons.
Biden said abortion rights do not rest with the Supreme Court anymore. Instead, he told the crowd, the issue is up to Congress and "the final say about your right to choose rests with you."
Remarks concluded at 12:57. POTUS now shaking hands and taking selfies with supporters on stage.
