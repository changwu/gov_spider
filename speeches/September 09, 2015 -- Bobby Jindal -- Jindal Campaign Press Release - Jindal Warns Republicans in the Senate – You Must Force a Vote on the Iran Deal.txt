    BATON ROUGE- Even though it has not yet been reported in the press, there is talk inside of the Republican Senate conference of the possibility of not ever forcing a vote on the Iran deal now that it appears President Obama has the 41 votes necessary to filibuster.
Governor Jindal said, "This would be a tragic mistake by Senate Republicans, and would call into question why they are even in office in the first place."
"Not forcing every single member of the US Senate to cast a vote would be tantamount to surrender. The American people will not tolerate this kind of cowardice."
"This deal with Iran is the equivalent of the United States negotiating with terrorists. Every United States Senator must be forced to vote and show the American people whether they support or oppose this dangerous new strategy."
