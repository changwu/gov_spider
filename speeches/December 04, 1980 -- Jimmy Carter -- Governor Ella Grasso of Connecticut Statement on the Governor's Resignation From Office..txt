    I am deeply sorry to learn that Governor Ella Grasso's health has forced her to announce her resignation from office.
In her quarter century of public service to the people of Connecticut and the Nation, Ella Grasso has demonstrated and fulfilled the great potential of democratic governmentâ€”integrity, compassion, and responsibility.
As State legislator, Connecticut's secretary of state, Member of Congress, and for 6 years as Governor, Ella Grasso has fought to improve the lives of those most vulnerable in our society.
Her career stands as a testament to the good that government can do, and to the difference one person can make.
I have valued her hard work and support during my own period of national service. I will continue to treasure her as a friend.
Governor Grasso, the gratitude and prayers of all of us go with you.
