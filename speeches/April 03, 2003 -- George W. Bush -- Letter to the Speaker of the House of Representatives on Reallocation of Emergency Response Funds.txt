    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In order to continue the investigation into the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
At this time, $9 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States to ensure that it has the necessary resources to investigate fully the terrible tragedy of September 11, 2001. My Administration is strongly committed to the purpose and mission of the Commission and will continue to cooperate with the Commission in accordance with applicable law to help ensure that it succeeds. I expect that the Commission's final report will contain important recommendations.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and recommendations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
