    The Clinton Campaign today named Alabama Agriculture and Industry Commissioner Ron Sparks Co-Chair of Rural Americans for Hillary.
"Hillary's commitment to revitalizing rural America and her 35-year record of public service on behalf of children and families make her uniquely qualified to be President," Commissioner Sparks said. "She has the strength and experience to bring the real change this country needs."
Elected Commissioner in 2002 and reelected overwhelmingly in 2006, Sparks has expanded the Food Safety Division to better protect the state's food supply, and has advocated Country of Origin Labeling. Commissioner Sparks has started several programs to improve nutrition in Alabama's public schools and expand programs to help schools serve locally grown food. He also founded Rural Alabama's Committee of 100 to champion the state's rural communities.
Commissioner Sparks has also implemented programs to help Alabama become less dependent on foreign oil, establishing the Center for Alternative Fuels to serve as a central hub for information in the field of alternative fuels.
In recognition of his work, Commissioner Sparks became president-elect of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture in 2007 and received the Innovative Alabama Governments Award from Auburn University in Montgomery. He has also received the Service to Agriculture Award from the Alabama Farmers Federation, the organization's highest honor.
"I am honored to have Ron's support, and delighted that he'll play a leading role in my campaign in Alabama and nationally," Clinton said.
