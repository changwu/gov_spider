    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Sponsors:   Obey (D), Wisconsin)
This Statement of Administration Policy expresses the Administration's views on H.R. 4426, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, PY 1995, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.
The Administration commends the House Committee for its continued support for important foreign policy priorities, including full funding for the Middle East peace process as well as for assistance to Russia and the other New Independent States. The Administration also commends the Committee's efforts to provide as much funding as feasible for the multilateral development banks, given the bill's tight overall funding constraints.
The Administration is pleased that the Committee has not included earmarks and other serious limitations in the bill. Under the tight budget constraints, the President must retain flexibility in order to manage programs effectively and to respond to foreign policy issues that may arise.
