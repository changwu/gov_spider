But it's time for someone to speak truth here â€“ the absurdity of political correctness on college campuses is laughable, but the consequences are not.
President Obama has encouraged a culture of professional victimhood and grievance. Everyone is encouraged to be a victim.

They will be completely incapable of dealing with any adversity and unprepared to handle freedom of thought or expression.
How will these emotional juveniles be able to compete with the rest of the world? Imagine them negotiating with the Russians or the Chinese or the Iranians. Perhaps they will ban certain words? Or demand the establishment of a "safe zone."
Our colleges and universities should be defenders of free speech and the First Amendment. They should prepare students for the simple fact that in the real world you do not get to dictate what you will and will not deal with. If they don't do this, they are hurting the students.
