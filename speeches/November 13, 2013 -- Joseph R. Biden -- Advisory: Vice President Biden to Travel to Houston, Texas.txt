    WASHINGTON, DC - On Monday, November 18th, Vice President Joe Biden will travel to the Port of Houston in Houston, Texas, to discuss the importance of investing in infrastructure to improve America's competitiveness, strengthen the middle class, and grow our economy. Following his visits to the Ports of Baltimore, Savannah, and Charleston, and an intermodal freight facility in North Baltimore, Ohio, the Vice President will highlight how federal investments are helping the Port of Houston and ports across the U.S. prepare to capitalize on the expansion of the Panama Canal.
The Vice President's visit comes the day before his visit to Panama and tour of the Panama Canal expansion project, which will double the capacity of the canal and allow significantly larger ships to call on U.S. ports, helping spark job creation and prosperity at home and across the Americas. Additional details about the Vice President's trip are forthcoming.
