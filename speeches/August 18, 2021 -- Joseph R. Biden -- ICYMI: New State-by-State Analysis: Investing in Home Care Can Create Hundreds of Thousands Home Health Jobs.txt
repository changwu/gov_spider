    President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda will make a generational investment to expand home care for older and disabled Americans, while improving the jobs and the pay of the home care workers who care for them. Recent analysis from the Center for American Progress shows these kinds of investments can create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the impact would be felt in all 50 states.
Since President Biden took office, there has been historic job growth â€“ four million new jobs, the most in any President's first six months on record. The average number of new unemployment insurance claims has been cut by more than half and the U.S. is on track to reach the highest levels of growth in nearly four decades. While the American Rescue Plan is changing the course of the pandemic and delivering relief for working families, this is no time to build back to the way things were.
This is the moment to reimagine and rebuild a new economy by making transformational investments in our middle-class and economic competitiveness. President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda will reduce health insurance premiums, saving 9 million people an average of $50 per person per month, and add dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare. By closing the Medicaid gap for low-income Americans, the President's plan would help 4 million uninsured people gain coverage. The President's proposed investments in home- and community-based services will solidify our care infrastructure, easing the burden of high costs on working families and creating millions of good-paying jobs.
