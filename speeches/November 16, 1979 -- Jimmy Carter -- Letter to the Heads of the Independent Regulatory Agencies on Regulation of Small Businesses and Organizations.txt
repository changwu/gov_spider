    Dear Mr. Chairman:
This Administration has made a firm commitment to strengthen the small business sector of our economy. Today I have directed the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies to take a series of steps to ensure that federal regulatory programs do not place unnecessary burdens on small businesses and organizations. I believe it is essential that we minimize the regulatory burden on small businesses and organizations where it is possible to do so without undermining the goals of our social and economic programs.
With the cooperation of the independent regulatory commissions in this effort to bring relief to small businesses, we can effectively respond to public concerns by showing flexibility in our regulatory policy where it is warranted and possible. I, therefore, am asking you, as Chairman of your agency, to consider taking actions similar to those contained in my memorandum of November 16 on this subject to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
