    Today the Senate finally confirmed Loretta Lynch to be America's next Attorney General, and America will be better off for it. Loretta has spent her life fighting for the fair and equal justice that is the foundation of our democracy. As head of the Justice Department, she will oversee a vast portfolio of cases, including counterterrorism and voting rights; public corruption and white-collar crime; judicial recommendations and policy reviewsâ€”all of which matter to the lives of every American and shape the story of our country. She will bring to bear her experience as a tough, independent, and well-respected prosecutor on key, bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform. And she will build on our progress in combatting newer threats like cybercrime. Loretta's confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our Nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law.
