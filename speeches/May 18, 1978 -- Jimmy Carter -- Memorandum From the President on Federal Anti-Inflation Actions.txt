    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Inflation is a corrosive nation-wide problem, and yet the Federal Government's direct control over wages and prices is limited. If we are to expect labor and industry to join in voluntary restraints, then we must lead the way where we can.
I have already ordered pay raises reduced for Federal employees. To complement and balance this constraint on labor in the public sector, I am now ordering additional anti-inflation actions through the Federal Government's $81 billion annual purchases of goods and services.
Like any consumer, the Government must react to high costs and the inflationary spiral. If goods or services are priced too high, the Government must decide whether it can do without certain things, or whether it can delay purchases. Therefore, I hereby direct all Agencies to avoid or delay the purchase of those goods or services whose prices are rising rapidly. The only exceptions will be where such action (1) would seriously jeopardize our National defense, or (2) would cause serious and counterproductive unemployment problems; and suitable alternatives or substitutes are not available.
In addition, I am directing that price escalation clauses of all new or renegotiated Federal contracts reflect the principle of deceleration. This will slow the built-in spiral of inflation in several billion dollars worth of purchases.
These new procurement procedures, and others to come, will be carried out by OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy in cooperation with the Agencies.
