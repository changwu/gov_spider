    Well, I'm glad I got to hear the last of B.A.'s speech, and let me say to all of you, I'm jealous of you. I wish I were there tonight. I had looked forward to being there very much, but I got quite sick with the winter flu, and I've got the Israelis and the Syrians coming in this week, and I have to be well for them. So the doctor said I couldn't get on the airplane.
So I wanted to call and just, first of all, thank all of you for honoring Lloyd and B.A. and for raising so much money for the Democrats in Texas. I think we're going to win the House back in the next election. And I'm doing everything I can to do my part.
But I also want to thank you because of the career and the public service of Lloyd Bentsen, that you honor tonight. Because there is a reason we're trying to win the House back: because of the direction we want the country to take in the new century. And everything he has done in his entire career embodies that.
So Lloyd, I miss you, and I love you. And I love you, B.A. I'm sorry I couldn't be there. I'm sick I missed Ann Richards' jokes. [Laughter] And you all owe me a raincheck, just like I owe you one.
Thank you, and God bless you all.
