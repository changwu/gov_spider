    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith report one new proposed rescission and one new deferral as required by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. In addition, I am transmitting one supplementary report which revises a deferral report made to the Congress in a previous special message. The details of the rescission and deferral reports are attached.
The proposed rescission would affect two programs of the Community Services Administration that duplicate several programs currently operating at Federal, State and local levels. The two deferrals are routine in nature and do not affect program levels in either case.
I urge the Congress to act promptly on this rescission and other rescission proposals now pending.
