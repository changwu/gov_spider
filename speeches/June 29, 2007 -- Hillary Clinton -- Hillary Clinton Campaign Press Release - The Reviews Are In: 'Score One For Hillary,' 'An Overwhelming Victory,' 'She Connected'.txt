    DES MOINES REGISTER'S YEPSEN - 'SCORE ONE FOR HILLARY,' 'CRISP, COGENT AND METHODICAL': "Score one for Hillary Clinton. The New York senator turned in the single most impressive performance during a debate among the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night in Washington, D.C. Clinton was crisp, cogent and methodical in her answers. She understood better than any of the other candidates the need for terse answers when so many candidates are given so little time in which to answer questions. It's more than just a debating skill. American presidents lead the nation through television appearances, and Clinton's performance Thursday night suggests she can do that." [Des Moines Register, 6/29/07]

THE NATION - 'ANOTHER DEBATE, ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT FOR HILLARY':"Another Debate, Another Good Night for Hillary Clinton... Rather, it was a comment by Clinton to the reality of how deeply racial disparities still divide and damage the United States. During a discussion of responses to the AIDS crisis, which had hit young African-American women especially hard, the senator from New York said, "Let me just put this in perspective: If HIV-AIDS were the leading cause of death of white women between the ages of 25 and 34 there would be an outraged, outcry in this country." Clinton had to struggle to finish the sentence, as the crowd's applause rose to deafening levels. It was a masterful moment; one that, fairly or unfairly, inspired comparisons with the best performances of his husband, Bill. And, while Clinton did not dominate this debate as she did the last one in New Hampshire, she again came off as the most polished of the candidates. [The Nation, 6/28/07]
