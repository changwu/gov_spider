    I welcome the successful outcome of talks between the United States and North Korea today in New York, which have led to the agreement of North Korea to suspend its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This agreement is a first but vital step towards ensuring North Korean participation in a strong international nonproliferation regime, a goal that will benefit all nations.
Preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is one of the highest priorities of my administration, and we will continue to press the North Koreans strongly to comply fully with international standards and to move towards the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
The American negotiating team, under the direction of Assistant Secretary Robert Gallucci, achieved this important step not only on behalf of the people of the United States but on behalf of the entire international community.
