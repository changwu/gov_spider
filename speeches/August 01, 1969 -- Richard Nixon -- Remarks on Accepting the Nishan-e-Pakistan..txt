    Mr. President:
I wish to express my deep appreciation to you and the Government of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan for honoring me this way.
I think you would be interested to know that for me this is the first time since becoming President of the United States-this is the first citation of this type or any decoration that I have received. I am proud of it.
I want you to know, too, that the citation, the eloquent words that were expressed, I only hope that I can be worthy of those words, of those sentiments, and also to say finally that I accept this award as President of the United States for the American people, but also I accept it in another sense, for more personal reasons, as one who has been, is, and always will be a friend of Pakistan.
