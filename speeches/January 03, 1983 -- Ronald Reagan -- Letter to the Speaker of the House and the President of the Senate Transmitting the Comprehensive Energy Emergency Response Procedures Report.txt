    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with Section 3 of the Energy Emergency Preparedness Act of 1982 (EEPA) (P.L. 97-229), I hereby transmit the Comprehensive Energy Emergency Response Procedures Report.
As required by the EEPA, the Report addresses the policies and procedures which the Administration intends to pursue in responding to a severe energy supply interruption or other substantial reduction in the amount of petroleum products available to the United States. It provides an indication of the various response options which may be considered if it becomes necessary to implement any of the emergency authorities outlined in the Memorandum of Law communicated to the Congress on November 15, 1982. Finally, it identifies specific areas that are under study to determine whether additional or amended statutory authority is appropriate.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
