Interview On Fox News' "America's Pulse"
April 8, 2008
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: "I hope Senator Obama will comment on this. I hope he will step up to the plate and say, 'You know whatever differences I have with Senator McCain, this is out of bounds. I don't question his humanity.' You know, John McCain was a fighter pilot assigned his missions by the United States Navy and I can't think of a more noble thing to do for your country than to fight for freedom and to serve in uniform. So John will move on, but I hope Obama will comment on this."
