    I am pleased that the Senate tonight passed the Food Quality Protection Act. Americans have every right to expect the world's most bountiful food supply will also be the world's safest. Earlier this month, I announced tough new measures to improve meat and poultry safety. Meeting goals I set early in my administration to strengthen our pesticide laws, this legislation is another major step forward. It puts in place a strong health-based standard, provides special safeguards for children, and protects our health and safety using the best science available. This bill demonstrates how Congress and the administration can work together to help farmers and consumers, and I look forward to signing it.
