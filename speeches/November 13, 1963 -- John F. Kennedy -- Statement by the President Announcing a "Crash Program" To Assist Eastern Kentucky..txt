    I HAVE today met with Governor Bert Combs of Kentucky and members of the Kentucky congressional delegation to discuss a "crash program" designed to bring special attention to the especially hard-hit area of eastern Kentucky--the most severely distressed area in the Nation. The severe winters experienced in the mountainous area of eastern Kentucky will cause hardships which will make it imperative that special attention be directed by Federal agencies, the State of Kentucky, and by national voluntary agencies and service organizations to the plight of thousands of unemployed in the area and to their families.
I have asked Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., Under Secretary of Commerce, to supervise this program and I have instructed the departments and agencies of the executive branch of the Federal Government to cooperate to the end that their existing programs be used, in accordance with appropriate statutes, to make a special effort to enable those requiring assistance to have adequate food, shelter, and medical attention during the difficult months of the winter season nearly upon us.
A preliminary examination of existing programs by Federal officials has indicated that special efforts are possible in such areas as-increased public health services--a strengthened school lunch program, an accelerated vocational rehabilitation program, an effort to insure that those entitled to social security benefits who are presently not receiving them be advised of their rights to do so, a stepped up program of disposal of surplus Federal property, a special milk program, rural housing grants to permit repair and improvements for existing houses in the area, the distribution of surplus commodities to some counties not now participating in the program, stimulation of self-help programs, and the providing of 1,000 jobs for a 4-month period as the result of an allocation of eastern Kentucky from the additional $45 million of accelerated public works funds to be requested by the administration.
All of these activities can be undertaken without additional legislation except for the accelerated public works program which hinges upon congressional action on the request for the $45 million appropriation. In some instances these accelerations will be facilitated by State legislation and Governor Combs has indicated his willingness, as has Governor-elect Breathitt, to cooperate in every possible way.
The aim of this "crash program" is to provide immediate assistance to the hardest hit counties of eastern Kentucky. It will supplement the efforts of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission to provide a permanent program of economic recovery for the entire Appalachian region. Many Federal programs designed to provide long-range improvement in the economic conditions of eastern Kentucky and other hard-hit areas throughout the country--for example the area redevelopment program and the manpower development and training program--are presently under way; and additional programs--including the youth employment opportunities proposal, the tax reduction legislation, and the National Service Corps proposal--will, if enacted, strengthen the economy throughout the Nation and thereby assist eastern Kentucky and other similarly situated areas.
Governor Combs and Governor-elect Breathitt have assured me of their cooperation and that of the State of Kentucky, and I hope that many national service organizations as well as voluntary agencies and private individuals will assist in this vital and humanitarian undertaking.
