    The President. What'd you say? [Laughter] Well, here it is Thanksgiving again and all the things that we have to be thankful for at this time. I think in terms of family and home and children and all of that. And if they don't know already that Mr. Waits is the executive vice president of the National [Turkey] Federation—
Mr. Walts. Yes, sir.
The President.—and that this turkey's name is Woody. [Laughter] And Woody is not going to go on the platter. [Laughter] He's going to go back to Evans Mill—is that right?
Mr. Walts. Evans Farm Inn.
The President. Evans Farm.
Mr. Walts. It's a pet farm.
The President. Yes, where he'll stay and finally be able to grow up. [Laughter] Ooops! Well, Woody, it's nice to see you here.
Mr. Walts. Mr. President, we certainly appreciate you—
The President. Well. Mr. Walts. Actually, you'll be retiring January 20th, and I'll be retiring January 16th, so we're going out together. [Laughter]
Mr. Hermanson. Thank you for 8 good years.
Mr. Walts. Absolutely.
The President. Thank you very much.
Mr. Hermanson. There's a lot of Iowa corn in that turkey.
The President. Yes.
