    Today I have signed into law S. 838, the "Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, Adoption and Family Services Act of 1992." The Administration strongly supports reauthorization of the programs covered by this Act.
A child's physical and mental well-being is a crucial element in the achievement of his or her potential. Unfortunately, over one million children per year suffer because they do not receive adequate care and support. Reauthorization of the programs in this Act will help prevent child maltreatment and provide assistance to children in need.
The Act, however, contains an objectionable provision -- a requirement that the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect recommend changes in Federal law to implement a national policy on child abuse prevention. I must view this provision as advisory rather than mandatory, in order to avoid conflict with my exclusive authority under the Constitution to decide whether and when the executive branch should propose legislation.
