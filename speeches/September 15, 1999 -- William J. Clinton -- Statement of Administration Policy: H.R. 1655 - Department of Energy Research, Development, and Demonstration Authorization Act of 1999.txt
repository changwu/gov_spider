    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Calvert (R) CA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1655 because the bill would hamper the Department of Energy's ability to carry out its research and development programs. Specifically, the bill would impose numerous counterproductive conditions and restrictions on construction, procurement, and management, including excessive restrictions on foreign visitors at civilian laboratories. Most significantly, the bill would adversely affect the construction of the Spallation Neutron Source by authorizing insufficient funding and imposing unneeded reporting requirements. These provisions would only serve to delay the project and increase its costs. This critically important facility is needed to help the United States recapture its position of world leadership in neutron science and related industrial and biomedical applications. Similarly, the bill would reduce authorized funding for the Climate Change Technology Initiative and thereby delay important developments in fuel efficiency and renewable energy technology. The Administration would strongly support amendments to increase funding for these programs at least to the levels requested in the President's budget.
