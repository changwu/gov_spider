    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lewis (R) Fla.)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4090, because:
— the 128,000 acres the bill would add to the Preserve are not essential for habitat for the Florida Panther, one of the three main justifications cited for expanding the Preserve;
— there is no evidence that the additional land is threatened with imminent development requiring Federal acquisition;
— existing mechanisms and administrative solutions are adequate to protect the watershed of the area; and
— enactment could impede completion of Interstate 75 in a cost-effective and expeditious manner.
In short, there is no compelling reason to spend over $40 million to expand the Federal estate in southern Florida, when the Federal Government already owns about 2 million acres nearby and about 4.2 million acres in the State.
