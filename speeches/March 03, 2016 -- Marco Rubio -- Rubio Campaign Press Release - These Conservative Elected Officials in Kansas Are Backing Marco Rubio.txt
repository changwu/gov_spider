State Rep. Erin Davis, another co-chair, discussed the stakes of this election:
This election represents a turning point for our country, and Marco Rubio is the leader we need to bring the nation back to its core constitutional principles of safety and liberty. I'm so pleased to work alongside a host of other Kansas leaders who also know that Marco is the conservative president our country deserves after eight years of the Obama administration.
