    Mitt Romney today announced the members of his Wyoming leadership team.
"I am humbled to have the support of so many great public servants in Wyoming," said Mitt Romney. "Under my economic plan, Wyoming will be able to develop its natural resources and be a leader in our country's economic comeback. I look forward to working with these leaders to help Wyoming reach its full potential."
State Chair Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis said, "Wyoming has faced first-hand the consequences of President Obama's big-government over-regulation that has hindered our state's economic development. Mitt Romney knows that the best thing Washington can do is to get out of the way of job creators. President Obama's approach to government has been to balloon government and put us on a path toward Greece. Mitt Romney will shrink government, put an end to burdensome regulations, and create an environment where small businesses can thrive. I urge fellow Wyoming voters to support Mitt Romney â€” our country can't afford four more years of failed leadership."
