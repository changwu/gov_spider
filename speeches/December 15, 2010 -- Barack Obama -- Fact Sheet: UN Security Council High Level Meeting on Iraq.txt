    Today marks an important milestone in the restoration of Iraq's normalized ties to the international community. The UN Security Council, in a special session chaired by Vice President Biden, took significant steps to return Iraq to the legal and international standing it held prior to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait with the passage of three resolutions. Additionally, the Security Council issued a Presidential statement reaffirming the Security Council's commitment to Iraq and support for UNAMI, welcoming Iraqi progress and reintegration into the region, and encouraging Iraq and all regional states to deepen and broaden their relationships.
With today's action by the Security Council the United States and the international community are keeping their commitments to the Government and the people of Iraq. The resolutions adopted today by the Security Council will lift several longstanding Chapter VII restrictions on Iraqi trade and activity.
The three Security Council resolutions passed today are Resolution 1956, which terminates the UN supervised arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq on June 30, 2011; Resolution 1957 which ends restrictions related to civilian nuclear cooperation placed on Iraq after the first Gulf War; and Resolution 1958, which ends the residual activities of the Oil for Food program.
Despite hardships, Iraq has made tremendous progress over the past few years and today is a far safer, more secure, and economically stable country. The United States urges Iraq's neighbors and the international community to work closely with Iraq to resolve remaining outstanding Chapter VII issues, particularly outstanding issues between Iraq and Kuwait.
Resolution 1956 – Development Fund for Iraq Resolution

Resolution 1956 formally terminates the arrangements established in 2003 for the Development Fund for Iraq on June 30, 2011, as a result of Iraq's progress towards resolving debts and claims inherited from the previous regime and establishing accountable successor arrangements for the transition of the Fund.


Arrangements for the DFI were originally established in UNSCR 1483 to accumulate all proceeds from the export sales of petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas in Iraq until such time as an internationally recognized, representative government of Iraq had been properly constituted.


The passage of this resolution indicates that the Council believes that significant progress has been made in establishing post-DFI, Iraqi-managed successor arrangements and the strengthening of Iraqi institutions, and that in light of this progress, the DFI arrangements will end on June 30, 2011.

Resolution 1957 – Weapons of Mass Destruction Resolution

Resolution 1957 lifts the restrictions imposed by UNSCRs 687 and 707 relating to weapons of mass destruction and civilian nuclear activities. The Security Council has taken this step in recognition of Iraq's commitment to the international non-proliferation regime, its compliance with relevant treaties, its adherence to the highest non-proliferation standards, and its provisional application of the Additional Protocol to its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), pending its entry into force.


Iraq affirmed in January 2010 to the UNSC by letter that it will support the international non-proliferation regime and comply with relevant disarmament treaties and other international instruments. The IAEA expressed in a March 2010 letter from IAEA Director General Amano to the UN Security Council President that it has received excellent cooperation from Iraq.


In 2009 and 2010, Iraq also acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, and subscribed to the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. The resolution lifting Iraq's civilian nuclear restrictions reflects this record of progress.


Iraq will remain under certain restrictions as a result of their commitments under the NPT and the CWC, however, the most significant result of lifting these restrictions will be the removal of the international stigma associated Iraq being subject to these Security Council Resolutions.


However, Iraq will also now have the freedom to pursue a wider array of civil nuclear activities.

Resolution 1958 – Oil-for-Food Resolution

Resolution 1958 terminates the residual activities of the Oil-For-Food program in recognition of Iraq's success in closing out remaining contracts under the program.


In recent months, the UN Controller's Office has worked with the Central Bank of Iraq and BNP Paribas to pay remaining contracts. With the closure of the OFF program, approximately $650 million in remaining funds will be returned to the Government of Iraq.

In recognition of Iraq's success in closing out remaining contracts in the Oil-for-Food program, the Council has also adopted resolution 1958 to terminate the residual activities of the Oil-For-Food program. And in recognition of Iraq's progress towards the establishment of effective and accountable successor arrangements for the transition of the Development Fund for Iraq, the Security Council has adopted resolution 1956 which terminates arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq on June 30, 2011. Welcoming the progress made by the Governments of Iraq and Kuwait towards the resolution of the outstanding issues between both countries, and encouraging their further cooperation, the Security Council calls on Iraq to quickly fulfill its remaining obligations under the relevant Chapter VII Security Council resolutions pertaining to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait.
The Security Council welcomes Iraq's reintegration into the region and encourages Iraq and all regional states to deepen and broaden their relationships and to conduct those relationships in a spirit of partnership and cooperation.
The Security Council reaffirms its full support for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) in advising, supporting, and assisting the Iraqi people and Government to strengthen democratic institutions, advance inclusive dialogue and national reconciliation, facilitate regional dialogue, aid vulnerable groups, strengthen gender equality, promote the protection of human rights, including through the establishment of the Independent High Commission for Human Rights, promote the protection of affected civilians, including children, women and members of religious and ethnic minority groups, and promote judicial and legal reform.
The Security Council commends UNAMI, headed by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, for its support throughout the electoral process, consistent with its mandate.
The Security Council encourages UNAMI's continued work, in coordination with the Government of Iraq, to provide protection and help create conditions conducive to voluntary, safe, dignified, and in particular, the sustainable return of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons, and stresses the importance of further attention to this issue by all concerned.
The Security Council underscores UNAMI's important role in supporting the Iraqi people and Government to promote dialogue, ease tension, and encourage a negotiated political agreement to the nation's disputed internal boundaries, and calls upon all relevant parties to participate in an inclusive dialogue to this end.
