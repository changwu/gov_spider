    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Seiberling (D) Ohio and ten others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4814. The bill would make Forest Service land exchanges more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to complete. Moreover, it would interfere with satisfactory land exchange procedures used by the Bureau of Land Management and other Federal agencies.
