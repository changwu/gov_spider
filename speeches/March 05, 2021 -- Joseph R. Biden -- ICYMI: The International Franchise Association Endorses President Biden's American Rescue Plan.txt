    The International Franchise Association (IFA) endorsed the American Rescue Plan on behalf of their members saying it gives their members the assistance they desperately need to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The endorsement states "IFA appreciates President Biden's focus on increasing vaccinations, putting direct payments in the pocketbooks of Americans who need them most, extending the Employee Retention Tax Credit and establishing a restaurant grant program that recognizes eligibility for small franchises in one of the hardest hit sectors of the economy. Full recovery requires both a health care response and an economic response. The franchise sector alone is poised to add 800,000 new jobs if those conditions are met. It's clear that additional small business relief will be needed, including an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program and other sector specific relief for industries like hospitality and fitness, to ensure that full recovery. IFA stands ready to work with the Administration and Congress to deliver a long-term solution."
The Franchiser's join a long list of individuals and organizations who are showing the benefits of urgent relief including Brookings, Moody's Analytics, and the Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund.
The support from the Franchiser's also follows a similar letter last week from the National Restaurant Associatio, over 160 business leaders supporting the Biden's American Rescue Plan, a survey from CNBC that showed 63% of small business owners support the rescue plan, and numerous polls showing bipartisan support for the plan, including a recent Navigator poll that shows 76% of Americans â€“ and 60% of Republicans support the American Rescue Plan. This latest endorsement also follows the support of more than 400 more bipartisan mayors across the nation.
