    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On June 6, 2003, the United States Trade Representative signed the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement on behalf of the United States. Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107â€“210), I am submitting a description of the changes to existing laws, prepared by my Administration, that would be required to bring the United States into compliance with that Agreement.
I look forward to working with the Congress in developing legislation to implement this important Free Trade Agreement.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
