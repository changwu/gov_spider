    I am designating Federal emergency assistance today to help those communities in Florida and Georgia damaged by the recent severe weather. The people of both Franklin County, Florida, and Macon, Georgia, have worked hard to help those directly affected by the storm.
As you continue with the cleanup, I hope this Federal assistance will aid in the economic recovery of both communities.
