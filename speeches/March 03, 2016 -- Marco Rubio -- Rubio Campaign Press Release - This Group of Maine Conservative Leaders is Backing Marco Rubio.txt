Today, Team Marco announced a growing group of leaders in Maine endorsing Marco. Leaders in all 50 states are rallying behind Marco's vision for a New American Century.
State Senator Amy Volk says it's about uniting the Republican Party:
After too many years of economic stagnation, weakness abroad and a sense of national decline, we need a leader that can unite our country and lead us into a New American Century. While others take advantage of and prey on people's fears, Marco Rubio has a conservative, optimistic vision for the future of our nation and is the only candidate that can win in November. I strongly encourage my fellow Mainers to support Marco Rubio.
Representative Dustin White says it's about the future of America:
I am enthusiastically supporting Marco Rubio for President of the United States because he is the only candidate running that can beat Hillary Clinton and accomplish real conservative reforms for our country. Marco represents the very best of what our nation has to offer and I am confident that as president he will fight every day to ensure the next generation has every opportunity to prosper and achieve the American Dream. I urge Maine Republicans to caucus for Marco Rubio this Saturday, March 5th.
Welcome these Maine leaders to Team Marco!
