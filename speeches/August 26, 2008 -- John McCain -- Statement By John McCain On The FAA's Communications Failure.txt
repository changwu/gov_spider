    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement regarding the FAA's communications failure:
"The news that the Federal Aviation Administration has experienced a communications failure that has delayed flights across the eastern United States is yet another example of Washington failing the American people. It once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system. While we still do not know the full extent of today's problems, we do know that unless action is taken now, the breakdowns of today will become all too common in the future."
