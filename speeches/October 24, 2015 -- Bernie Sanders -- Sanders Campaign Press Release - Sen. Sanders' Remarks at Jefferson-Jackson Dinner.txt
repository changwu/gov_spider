    DES MOINES, Iowa — Here are excerpts from prepared remarks by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders for delivery Saturday night to the Iowa Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner:
"I promise you tonight as your president I will govern based on principle not poll numbers. I pledge to you that every day I will fight for the public interest not the corporate interests. I will not abandon any segment of American society – whether you're gay or black or Latino or poor or working class – just because it is politically expedient at a given time.
"So as we go forth tonight, our job in this election is to build a winning coalition of voters beginning here in Iowa and spreading across this nation who will elect the next Democratic president. I believe I can build that coalition because I know we have begun to build it in huge rallies and small gatherings. People are excited to be part of a political revolution that will change this nation and give us a future to believe in.
"In conclusion, let me leave you with words that have inspired me and I think fit our circumstances today. The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison wrote them when attacking the evils of slavery: 'I am in earnest— I will not equivocate— I will not excuse— I will not retreat a single inch— and I will be heard.'
"Well my friends, let us make sure that everyone knows that on the issues of equality, and justice, and ending a rigged economy that is held in place by a corrupt political system, on battling climate change, on halting the draining of American jobs to faraway places, on these issues and so many more: We are in earnest; We will not equivocate; We will not excuse; We will not retreat a single inch;
"And on the evening of February 1st, in every precinct, in living rooms, in high school gymnasiums, and all across Iowa, we will send a message to our nation and the world… We will be heard."
