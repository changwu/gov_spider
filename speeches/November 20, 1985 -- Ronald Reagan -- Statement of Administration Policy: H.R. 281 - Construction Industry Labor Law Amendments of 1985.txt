    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Clay (D) MO and 144 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 281. Under the bill, the terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employees of one business entity could be extended to cover the employees of another. This so-called "double breasting" provision would result in an unwarranted invasion into the free collective bargaining process. Moreover, the provision relating to pre-hire agreements imposes an agreement and a union on individuals who have not chosen them and prevents these workers from removing them except through a long and formal proceeding.
