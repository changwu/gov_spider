    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Title VI, Section 605 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended by P.L. 89â€”794, I am transmitting herewith the Eleventh Annual Report to the Congress of the National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.
This Report reflects the Council's views in its role in examining programs authorized by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, and their impact in alleviating certain problems confronting low-income people. While those views are not entirely consistent with this Administration's policies, we shall consider them in the future.
