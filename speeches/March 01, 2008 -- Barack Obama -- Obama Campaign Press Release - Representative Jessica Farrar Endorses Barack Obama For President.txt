    Houston, TX - Today, Representative Jessica Farrar endorsed Barack Obama for President, citing his unparalleled ability to bring together Americans of different political, racial, and socio-economic backgrounds, and leadership on issues that affect the Latino community, such as providing quality, affordable health care and education as well as achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Farrar said, "Senator Barack Obama is a leader who has championed the same causes I have long fought for in the state of Texas. The Latino community and the nation need a leader who understands the importance of building strong communities and uniting Americans, because like the threads of a rope, together we are stronger than when we stand alone."
Farrar has been a member of the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years and serves as Vice Chair of the Women's Health Caucus and Secretary for the Mexican American Legislative Caucus. She was joined today by local and national Latino elected officials and activists at the campaign's Heights Office located in Farrar's congressional district.
"I support Barack because we agree on the issues that matter to the Latino community," added Farrar. "His advocacy for the Dream Act, his record of pushing back against the special interests and his plan to cut health care costs by $2500 for families demonstrate his commitment to the Hispanic community."
"I am honored to have the support of such an influential leader in the Houston community," Senator Obama said. "Representative Farrar's extensive work on issues related to children's healthcare, education, and insurance coverage has produced real change in the lives of Texans. I look forward to working with her to make certain that not only Texans, but all Americans are ensured equal rights and opportunities."
