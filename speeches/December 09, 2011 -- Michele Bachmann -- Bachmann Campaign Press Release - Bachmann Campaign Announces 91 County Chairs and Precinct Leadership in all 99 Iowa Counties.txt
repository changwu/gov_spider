    Urbandale, Iowa â€“ Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann today announced her Iowa campaign has county chairs in 91 of the state's 99 counties and precinct leadership in every county. The announcement is further evidence of Team Bachmann's exceptional grassroots organizational strength, one of which has been gaining significant momentum as the Iowa caucuses near.
"I'm honored to have the support from committed conservatives across Iowa," Bachmann said. "There's always been the argument that the presidential battle is waged in Iowa's 18 urban counties and that the 81 less-populous, rural counties don't matter as much. Every voice, every voter counts, and with a win in Iowa, I intend to take those voices with me to the White House."
