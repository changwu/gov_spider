    I am pleased to send warm greetings to Jews around the world celebrating the Passover holiday, beginning at sundown on April 7. As you gather with family and friends, eat traditional foods, and sing joyous songs, you follow in the footsteps of your forefathers in remembering the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt nearly 3,500 years ago.
During this season of renewal, the Passover holiday commemorates the liberation of the Jewish people from slavery. Through the years, Jewish sages have taught that the lesson of freedom found in the miracle of Passover has two important aspects. The first is the escape from physical bondage and the regaining of dignity and equality by the individual and by a people. Equally important is spiritual liberation from selfish desires and destructive habits.
The flight from slavery led quickly to Mount Sinai and the Holy One's gift of the Commandments to Moses and the Israelites. They were then fully free to follow the Creator's laws in striving to perfect their own lives and the world in which they lived. The connection between freedom from bondage and the gift of the Commandments enhances Passover's abiding influence, not only as a Jewish holiday, but also as an inspiration to all mankind.
Laura joins me in sending best wishes for a joyous and memorable holiday observance.
