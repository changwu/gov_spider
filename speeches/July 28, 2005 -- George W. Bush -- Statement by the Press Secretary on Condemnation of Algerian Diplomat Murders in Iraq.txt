    The United States strongly condemns the brutal murders of two Algerian diplomats in Iraq. Ali Belaroussi and Azzedin Belkadir were sent to Baghdad by their government on a mission of peace. They were kidnapped from their Embassy on July 21 and, according to reports, they were executedon July 26. Our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to their families and to the people of Algeria. All who seek to rebuild and promote freedom in Iraq share their loss.
We are committed to bringing those responsible to justice. We join the international community in denouncing the senseless murder of diplomats by killers who mask their bankrupt agenda to spread terror and violence in the name of Islam. We stand with the people and Government of Algeria during this time of national grief.
