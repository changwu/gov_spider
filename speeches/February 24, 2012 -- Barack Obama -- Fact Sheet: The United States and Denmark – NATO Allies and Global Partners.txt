    President Obama hosted Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt for a meeting in the Oval Office on February 24. Denmark has the distinction of being the only Nordic country that is a member of both NATO and the European Union (EU), making it an especially valuable partner of the United States in a wide variety of endeavors in Europe and around the world. Denmark currently holds the rotating EU Presidency until the end of June.
Defense and Security Cooperation: As NATO allies, the United States and Denmark are committed to each other's security and stand together in critical crisis areas worldwide.
•      Libya: Denmark was among the first and most active participants in the UN-authorized NATO military intervention to protect Libyan civilians. It deployed F-16s during the entire seven-month civilian protection mission.
•      Afghanistan: Denmark is a key contributor to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), currently providing 650 combat troops operating without national caveats in one of the most challenging areas of the country.

•      Counter-Piracy: Denmark is one of the world's main seafaring nations (some 10 percent of global shipping moves in Danish-owned or –operated ships), and as such, is a leader in international efforts to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia, chairing an international working group on legal issues and twice commanding an international naval task force. Denmark has made significant contributions, including maritime patrol aircraft, to the NATO-led counter-piracy operation.
•      Security and Capacity-Building Cooperation Against Terrorism: Denmark is one of the United States' strongest and most dynamic counterterrorism partners. Denmark is a member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), a major multilateral initiative to strengthen the international architecture to deal with 21st century terrorism.

•      Bilateral Cooperation: Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Christian Friis Bach and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah were signatories of a Joint Statement by Development Ministers leading up to the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, South Korea. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to co-host a USAID conference focused on the Horn of Africa in March in Nairobi, Kenya.
Economic, Energy and Environmental Cooperation: The robust U.S.-Danish economic partnership creates jobs, is helping to build a sustainable energy economy, and advances scientific research in the Arctic.
•      Trade, Investment, and Jobs: The United States is Denmark's largest trading partner outside the European Union. Total bilateral trade in goods and services was approximately $25 billion in 2010. Danish direct investment in the U.S. was $9.9 billion in 2010. More than 250 Danish companies have subsidiaries in the U.S. employing over 35,000 Americans.
•      Green Growth: Denmark is the only net exporter of energy in the EU and a global leader in energy efficiency and renewable energy technology. The United States and Denmark work closely in multiple fora, including the Clean Energy Ministerial, to build the foundation for a sustainable global energy economy.

Ø     In October, Denmark hosted the first Global Green Growth Forum, a high-level gathering of international business, governmental and research leaders seeking to promote green economy issues.
Ø     The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen and the Danish employers' federation jointly facilitated matchmaking between American and Danish clean-tech companies at two Green Partnership events (May 2010 in Copenhagen, September 2011 in Washington D.C.), to create opportunities to export clean energy technology to markets around the world.
•      Scientific Cooperation: The U.S. and Denmark entered into a bilateral Science and Technology agreement in 2009. The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Technical University of Denmark have jointly led research to design more efficient wind energy systems since 2007, and are expanding their efforts to other renewable-energy and energy-efficiency technologies. Danish and U.S. health authorities have a history of cooperation on such topics as health information technology, communicable and non-communicable diseases, antimicrobial resistance and improving health care quality in hospital and primary care settings. In 2006, Denmark opened its Innovation Center in Silicon Valley, accelerating the entry of Danish companies into Silicon Valley and promoting U.S. investments in Denmark.

•      Climate Change: Denmark is a leader in addressing climate change. It pledged $207 million for fast-start climate finance for 2010-2012. The current government has announced a unilateral goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40 percent by 2020. An impetus is green growth, particularly given increased global wind technology competition. Denmark's global export of clean technologies peaked in 2008 at approximately $11.8 billion.

Ø     As president of the UN's 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-15) in December 2009, Denmark hosted President Obama and some 120 heads of state and government along with 24,000 people, the largest-ever gathering associated with international climate negotiations. The resulting Copenhagen Accord has paved the way for agreement in Cancun and Durban on a new framework to address climate change that includes action from developed and developing countries.
Ø     Denmark takes an active role in low-emissions development strategies (LEDS), encouraging developing countries' transition to low-emission, climate-resilient economies. In December 2010, Denmark joined an initiative with the Alliance of Small Island States, the World Bank and the UN Development Program, and pledged $14.5 million to kick off the initiative.
