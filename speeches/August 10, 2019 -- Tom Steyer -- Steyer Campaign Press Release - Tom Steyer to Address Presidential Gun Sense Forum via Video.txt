    (Des Moines, IA, August 10, 2019) â€” Today, in a prerecorded address, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer joined the Presidential Gun Sense Forum organized by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, in Des Moines, Iowa. In the video Steyer directly addressed the complicit role of the NRA and GOP in the most recent tragedies.
"When we see tragic events like the ones we saw in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, it can make us sad. It should make us feel sympathy for our fellow Americans, but we shouldn't be surprised," said Steyer in the video. "This is the absolute result of political corruption. The gun manufacturers through the NRA control the Republican Party and this president and they've prevented common sense gun legislation."
Steyer is not attending the forum due to a scheduling conflict, but he wholeheartedly believes in the work several organizations are doing in trying to achieve sensible gun reform, especially those seeking to ban assault weapons and restricting high-capacity magazines.
In the past, a Steyer-founded organization, NextGen America, partnered with Giffords, Everytown for Gun Safety, and ACRONYM to launch Our Lives, Our Vote, a program that empowered high school-aged Americans to vote out politicians beholden to the NRA by registering their peers to vote.
Tom Steyer supports universal background checks, red flag laws, banning assault weapons, and restricting high-capacity magazines. He supports prohibitions on 3D firearm printing, and banning gun possession for those who have been convicted of domestic violence. Tom thinks that gun manufacturers should not be immune from civil liability, and would support funding to study gun violence as a public health issue. He also supports federal databases to track gun sales, and opposes concealed carry reciprocity.
