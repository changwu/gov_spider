    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 2853, authorizing the termination of the application of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Bulgaria. It permits the President to accord permanent most-favored-nation (MFN) status to Bulgaria.
This is an important milestone in U.S.-Bulgarian relations. Bulgaria joins Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as democratic countries from which the United States has fully removed trade restrictions that originated in concerns about human rights practices during the Cold War period. The legislation signals America's confidence in the political development of Bulgaria and reaffirms America's commitment to Bulgaria as it continues its difficult and historic economic transformation.
Bulgaria's favorable record on immigration, its progress in the protection of human rights and development of a democratic, free-market society, and the establishment of cooperative relations with the United States helped facilitate passage of H.R. 2853.
