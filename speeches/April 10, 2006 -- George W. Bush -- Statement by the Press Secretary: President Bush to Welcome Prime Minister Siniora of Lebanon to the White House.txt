    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Fouad Siniora to the White House on April 18, 2006. Lebanon is a good friend and valued partner to the United States, and has made tremendous strides under Prime Minister Siniora's leadership toward greater prosperity and democracy since the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the country. The President and Prime Minister Siniora will discuss a range of issues, including economic development and democratic reform in Lebanon and the Middle East, the investigation into the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri last year, and Lebanon's continuing efforts to reestablish its sovereignty, freedom and independence.
