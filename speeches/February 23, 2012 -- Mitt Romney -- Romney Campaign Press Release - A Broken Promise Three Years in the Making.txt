    "This week marks another sad milestone in the failed presidency of Barack Obama. Today is the three-year anniversary of the President's pledge to cut our deficit in half. Instead, he put us on a path toward more debt, more deficits, and decline. Barack Obama is the first president in history to preside over a $1 trillion deficit. And his new budget ensures that he will preside over a $1 trillion deficit every year he is in office. It's disappointing, but not surprising. President Obama has no real world experience.  He's never run a business. He's never run a state. He's never had to make payroll or balance a budget." —Andrea Saul, Romney Spokesperson
