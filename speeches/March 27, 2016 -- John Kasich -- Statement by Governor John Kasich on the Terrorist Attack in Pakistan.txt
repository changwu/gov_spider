    Gov. John Kasich released the following statement in response to today's terrorist attack in Lahore, Pakistan:
The cowardly mass execution of innocent women and children, reportedly including Christian families, on Easter Sunday in Lahore, Pakistan is an outrage.
Coming on the heels of the terrorist attacks in Belgium, it is further confirmation that radical terrorists are at war with our culture, our values and our way of life.
This type of terrorism is an existential threat to all who share our values. It must be defeated.
The need for a strong America is greater than ever, and we must rise to the challenge. When America retreats or shows weakness, the entire world shudders.We must redouble our efforts with Pakistan to identify and eliminate terrorists groups, which Pakistan now recognizes pose a dire threat to its own national security as well.
Let us remember the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers as we gather strength and resolve to defeat all who threaten our values.
