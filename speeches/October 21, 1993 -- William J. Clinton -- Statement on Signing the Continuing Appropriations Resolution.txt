    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 281, a Continuing Resolution that funds the operations of the Federal Government during October 22-28, 1993.
A Continuing Resolution is necessary at this time in order to keep the Government functioning while the Congress completes the appropriations process.
I commend the Congress for presenting me with a funding measure that provides for a simple, temporary extension of normal government operations and is free of extraneous amendments. I urge the Congress to complete the regular appropriations process by October 28th so that an additional Continuing Resolution can be avoided.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 21, 1993.
