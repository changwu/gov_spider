    Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco called President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi of Yemen today to convey President Obama's strong support for President Hadi and the Yemeni people as they move forward from recent setbacks to the country's peaceful transition process. Ms. Monaco discussed President Hadi's plans to move quickly and decisively to implement the Peace and National Partnership Agreement, building on the recommendations of the National Dialogue and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative. This will include forming a strong government that is committed to partnering with the international community to address issues of mutual interest; resolving disagreements peacefully and without violence; accelerating the work of the constitutional drafting committee; and scheduling a constitutional referendum and elections, consistent with the GCC Initiative, to ensure the transition process meets the aspirations of all Yemeni people. Ms. Monaco reiterated the United States' strong condemnation of members of the Houthi movement and other parties who have resorted to violence to disrupt Yemen's peaceful transition and threaten the country's stability. She urged all parties to pursue reconciliation and underscored the United States' determination to designate individuals who threaten Yemen's peace, stability, and security, consistent with UN Security Council 2140 and U.S. Executive Order 13611. Finally, Ms. Monaco and President Hadi reaffirmed the enduring partnership between the United States and Yemen to counter the shared threat from al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula.
