    My fellow Americans:
It is a distinct privilege to join with you in tribute to my good friend and valued associate in the national Government, George Humphrey.
In the past three decades I have come to know many leaders in public and private affairs in our country and abroad.
Of these leaders of our time, I have found none to be abler-more dedicated--more courageous--more selfless and persevering in pursuit of the public good--than the Secretary of the Treasury, George M. Humphrey.
You and I are fortunate to have such a man in our Nation's service. In the Cabinet, in meetings of the important National Security Council, in personal conferences in my office, I can always count on George Humphrey to be a strong, able, and assertive counsellor--a man from whom sound and objective judgment is certain to be obtained, no matter what the issue involved.
I would deem it an honor to be personally present at this testimonial dinner, so as to share even more intimately in the tribute that the assembled group is paying to its guest of honor. But, denied that opportunity, I extend warm greetings to each of you present, along with my best wishes for a most successful evening. I am sure that it will live long in the memory of our great friend, the Secretary of the Treasury.
