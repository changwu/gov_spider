    THE PRESIDENT. I would like to say while the press are here that we've had a very enjoyable and a very productive hour or so together, not only describing to one another the commitment that we share for a good transition period, but also I've outlined to Governor Reagan some of the issues that I've faced as President that will be shared with him in the transition period and inherited by him on Inauguration Day.
One of the wonderful things about our country, being a democracy, is the orderly transition of authority and responsibility. He and I understand very well that I will be the President in the fullest sense of the word until Inauguration Day, and then instantly at the time he takes the oath of office, he will have the full responsibilities. We have a very good working relationship personally and also a very fine transition commitment, which has been in effect for several weeks now.
I understand that Rosalynn and Nancy have had a good visit, too, and Mrs. Reagan has had a chance to look at the White House and the place where they will be living in the future.
But I'm very grateful to Governor Reagan for having come this afternoon and permitted me to share with him some of the common commitments we have as the President and the future President of our Nation. It's been a delightful experience for me and very gratifying.
Governor Reagan?
THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. I want to express my appreciation to the President. He has been most gracious and most cooperative, he and his people, with regard to this transition and has certainly made it a much easier time than it could otherwise have been. And we're deeply grateful, appreciate it very much.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, sir. Good luck. I'll be seeing you in the future often.
THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. Thanks very much. I hope so.
MRS. REAGAN. Thank you so much.
