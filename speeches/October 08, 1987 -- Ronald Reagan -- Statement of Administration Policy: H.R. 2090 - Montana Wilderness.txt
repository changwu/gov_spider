    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Williams (D) Montana)
The administration opposes H.R. 2090, because it would designate almost twice as much wilderness — 1,402,160 acres vs. 747,708 acres —- as the Forest Service recommended as a result of its forest planning process. H.R. 2090 would also establish nine new special management areas totalling 797,500 acres, including six new national recreation areas, which is over 14 tiroes the 55,087 acres recommended by the Forest Service for a single special management area, 'the West Big Hole Watershed Study Area. The excessive designations included in H.R. 2090 would reduce future timber sales receipts, opportunities for future mineral development, and associated payments to the State of Montana. The bill would also unnecessarily restrict future land management options.
