    Today former Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, Jr. endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and officially became a member of the Kasich for America National Security Advisory Group.
"We know that ISIS and Islamic terrorists will stop at nothing to trample our freedoms and dismantle our democratic values. They pose a barbaric, complex and serious threat to our national securityâ€” one that can't be fought from a Cuban baseball stadium or an Argentine dance hall," said Lehman.
"In response, we need decisive action from a Commander-in-Chief who will not underestimate this threat or retreat from the world stage. I have no doubt that John Kasich stands ready as a strategic thinker and will be the determined leader we need in the White House to strengthen our military and implement effective strategies to combat terrorism. He alone is uniquely qualified, with his solid record of 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee, to protect our nation."

Lehman joins other senior members of the Reagan administration on the Kasich National Security Advisory Group. He served as Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan from 1981-1987, and built our seaborne strength to 600 ships. He was also appointed by President Bush to the 9/11 Commission.
"I welcome Secretary Lehman to our team. As a member of the Reagan administration, he saw firsthand when America leads we are safer and stronger," said Kasich. "I am grateful for his support, and for the expertise provided by all the members of my national security advisory group who recognize and firmly understand that America must lead in this fight to protect freedom and democracy."
