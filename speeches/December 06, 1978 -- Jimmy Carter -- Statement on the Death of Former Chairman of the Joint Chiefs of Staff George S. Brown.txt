    I join in mourning the passing of one of this Nation's most respected military leaders, George Brown. From the beginning of his career as a bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II to his service as an Air Force general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Brown served his country with distinction. He preferred a cockpit to sitting behind a desk, but wherever his country needed him, he answered the call with honor.
George Brown was a forthright, courageous man who inspired the men and women he served with and loved his country. He was what he always intended to be, a good soldier.
I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Alice, and their three children.
