    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Fascell (D) Florida and 37 others)
The Administration opposes House Concurrent Resolution 350, and believes that passage of the Resolution, even though it would not have the force of law, would not be in the national interest.
The Administration's position has long been clear: U.S. restraint requires Soviet reciprocity and compliance. The United States undertook not to undercut the SALT agreements so long as the Soviet Union exercised comparable restraint. The Soviet Union has not.
The Administration has already shown great restraint in remaining within the SALT structure while attempting to resolve our legitimate concerns with Soviet noncompliance which has undermined that same structure. The United States will continue to exercise restraint.
H. Con. Res. 350 would not meaningfully restrain the growth of Soviet forces nor would it bring the Soviet Union back into compliance with its past commitments. It could, however, serve as an excuse to avoid serious bargaining by the Soviet side.
Rejection of this Resolution would make clear to the Soviet leadership American resolve both to take those actions necessary to maintain the basis for deterrence and, in the process, to respond appropriately to Soviet noncompliance with agreement reached. The Administration, therefore, strongly urges the Congress to reject this Resolution.
