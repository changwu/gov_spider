    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through November 30, 1994. The current report covers December 1, 1994, through January 31, 1995.
On January 5, I appointed Mr. Richard I. Beattie as my U.S. Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus. Emissary Beattie will work closely with all parties to promote an overall solution that will be fair, just, and permanent. He and Special Cyprus Coordinator James Williams traveled to Cyprus on January 23 for extensive meetings with the leaders of both communities. The two leaders expressed their desire to reach a settlement. In addition, Mr. Denktash reiterated his commitment to a bizonal, bicommunal federation with a single sovereignty and single citizenship. Emissary Beattie and Special Cyprus Coordinator Williams will consult in Ankara during March to continue their efforts to facilitate agreements on concrete steps towards a solution.
Throughout the period, my representatives continued to work for comprehensive progress, both on concrete steps such as the confidencebuilding measures and on overall settlement issues. The Greek-Cypriot side endorsed this approach provided a common basis for an overall settlement has been established; the Turkish-Cypriot side urged we proceed incrementally from measures to overall talks. We will continue to pursue further efforts to establish such a common basis for a settlement.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
