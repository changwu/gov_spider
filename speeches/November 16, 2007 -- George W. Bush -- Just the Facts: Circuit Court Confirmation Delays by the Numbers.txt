    "Today I announced seven more outstanding judicial nominees for the district and circuit courts. And I look forward to working with the United States Senate to confirm these good men and women as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the Senate has failed to act on many of my other nominees. ... This leads to what are called 'judicial emergencies' - vacancies that cause justice to be degraded or delayed."
