    CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott released the following statement on the eighth anniversary of the shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church:
"Eight years ago, a hate-filled man walked into Mother Emanuel Church and murdered nine Christians in hopes of starting a race war, but instead sparked the most radical act of forgiveness our nation had witnessed in generations. The power of Matthew 5:44 – the power of forgiveness – rang true as the family members forgave the killer.
"Our nation benefits by reflecting on the 8th anniversary of the greatest act of forgiveness that unified our state and nation.
"Let us remember the words of Martin Luther King Jr. on the power of love: 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.'"
