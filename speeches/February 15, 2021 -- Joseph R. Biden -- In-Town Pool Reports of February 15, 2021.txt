In-town pool report #1 — rested ahead of POTUS' return to DC 
Happy Presidents Day on a dreary Monday at the White House. Pool has been tested ahead of POTUS' return to DC following a weekend at Camp David.
He's currently scheduled to arrive just after 3:00pm ET but has no other public events on the schedule. I'll let y'all know about any updates as soon as they're received and, as always, feel free to reach out directly with any questions.
