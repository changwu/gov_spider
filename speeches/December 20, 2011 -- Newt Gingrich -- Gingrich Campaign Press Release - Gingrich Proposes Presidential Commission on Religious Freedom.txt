    Today, the foundations for religious freedom in America are being eroded. The meaning of the First Amendment has been twisted to fit a post-modern world. As a result, public expressions of faith in some quarters have gone from normal to unacceptable. The abuses are well documented. Year after year, our courts are filled with hundreds of cases based upon the anti-religious misconceptions of the First Amendment, which are then reinforced by judges determined to impose their own views on other citizens.
For this reason, as part of its "On Day One" Executive Order project of the 21st Century Contract with America, NEWT 2012 will publish a final draft of a proposed executive order in September 2012. That order, which will be signed on the first day of a Gingrich administration, will establish a presidential commission on religious freedom. In the meantime, NEWT 2012 puts forth an initial outline of the mission of the presidential commission on religious freedom; and a plan for a campaign working group that will finalize the details of the executive order.
The paper below is our first step at creating the framework for this presidential commission. It is still in draft format, and we welcome your feedback on it.
Presidential Commission on Religious Freedom
