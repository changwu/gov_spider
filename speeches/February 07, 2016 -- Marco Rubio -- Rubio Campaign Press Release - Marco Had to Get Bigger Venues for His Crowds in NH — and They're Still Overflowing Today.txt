The event was supposed to be a pancake breakfast, but . . .

Even at a huge event, Marco takes the time to hear from voters one-on-one:

After a town hall, lots of questions, and lots of hands shaken, it was off to Bedford, where another big crowd was waiting:

The campaign team had already moved these events from smaller venues to accommodate Marcomentum — and yet they were still packed.
