    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on the announcement of President Obama's upcoming campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia:
"In less than two weeks, President Obama will bring his failed policies and broken promises to Virginia. His policies have taken our country in the wrong direction, and Virginia and the rest of the nation can't afford four more years of the same. Mitt Romney is a results-oriented conservative with a bold plan to create jobs, shrink government, and reduce our debt burden. When Virginians go to the polls in November, there will be a very clear choice: we can continue down the failed path that President Obama has taken the country, or we can choose Mitt Romney - a proven leader who will get our country on the right track."
