    It gives me great pleasure to join with the people of Mexico and everyone of Mexican heritage in the United States in commemorating the anniversary of a great day in the cause of Mexican freedom and independence-El Cinco de Mayo.
As the people of the United States begin to celebrate the Bicentennial of our Constitution, Mexicans around the world are commemorating the 125th anniversary of the Battle of Puebla, when the Mexican Army, outnumbered three to one, still won a great victory. The spirit of those brave soldiers gives eloquent testimony to some of the most cherished ideals we shareâ€”liberty, self-government, and the right to make our own destinies.
Today, our two nations have a special friendship and all those of Mexican descent in the United States continue to make many outstanding contributions to this country. I am happy to send warmest congratulations and good wishes to the people of Mexico and all those in the United States who celebrate this day in reaffirmation of liberty.
Viva Mexico! Viva la libertad! Que Dios los bendiga!
RONALD REAGAN
