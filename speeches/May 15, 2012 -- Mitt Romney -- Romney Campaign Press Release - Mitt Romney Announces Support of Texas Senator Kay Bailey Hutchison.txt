    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.
"I'm honored to have the support of a distinguished public servant like Kay," said Mitt Romney. "Kay has long been a fighter for the same principles as meâ€”scaling back the size of government, cutting spending, and repealing Obamacare. This campaign will not be easy, but I am confident that with the help of friends like Kay, we can defeat President Obama and implement pro-growth economic policies."
Announcing her support, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said, "I am proud to add my voice to the growing number of women across the country calling for an economy that will rebuild the middle class and create jobs. For too long, we have seen families lose their homes, gas prices rise, and young people have a hard time finding work. It is clear that the policies President Obama implemented did not live up to the promises candidate Obama made. We need a president who will restore America's prosperity and spur economic growth. That is why I'm honored to endorse Mitt Romney. He is a proven job creator with a track record of balancing budgets and turning around troubled enterprises. I cannot think of a more appropriate set of traits for our next president."
