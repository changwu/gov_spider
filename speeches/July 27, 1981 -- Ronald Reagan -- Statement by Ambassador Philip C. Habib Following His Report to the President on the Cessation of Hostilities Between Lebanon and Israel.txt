    I have just reported to the President on the mission which he directed me to undertake not long ago. This is a satisfying moment. An end to hostile military actions and the consequent bloodshed in the Israel-Lebanon area has now taken place. The situation, however, remains fragile and sensitive. That is normal and in the nature of such things. The progress achieved so far must not be lost. Everyone involved must exercise the greatest care and caution.
The end of armed attacks, which has been achieved, could be a first, important step on the road to greater calm and security in the area. This will be indispensable if future progress is to be made toward a broad and lasting peace in the Middle East. What has been accomplished could not have been done without the help and understanding of many people. The final result, I believe, is in the interest of all the parties involved.Thank you.
