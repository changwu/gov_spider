    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to acceptance, amendments to the Convention on the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization, signed at Geneva on March 6, 1948, which were adopted on November 14, 1975 and November 17, 1977, by the Assembly of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) at its ninth and tenth sessions. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State describing the amendments, their purpose, and effect.
Support for these amendments will contribute to the demonstrated interest of the United States in facilitating cooperation among maritime nations. To that end, I urge that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to these amendments and give its advice and consent to their acceptance.
