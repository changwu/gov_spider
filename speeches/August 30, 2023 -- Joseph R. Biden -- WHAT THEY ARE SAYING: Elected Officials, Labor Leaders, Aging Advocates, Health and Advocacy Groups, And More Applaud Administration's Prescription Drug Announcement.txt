    Yesterday, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the first 10 drugs selected for Medicare Price Negotiation – a critical provision under the Inflation Reduction Act that will finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug costs for seniors, people with disabilities, and other beneficiaries. For decades, Big Pharma has blocked this from happening, forcing millions of Americans to choose between paying for medications they need to live, or paying for other basic necessities.
Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, those days are ending. Up to 9 million Americans will be able to benefit from the new negotiated drug prices on 10 drugs used to treat some of the most common diseases like diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, blood clots, and cancers. In 2022 just one of these drugs could cost seniors up to $6,497 in out-of-pocket costs per year.
Yesterday's announcement is a major step forward in the Administration's efforts to lower costs for American families and make health care more affordable. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and their Administration won't stop until they finish the job.
See below for what they are saying:
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
Senate Majority Leader, New York Senator Chuck Schumer: "For years, politicians promised to take on the big drug companies and empower Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for consumers. With the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats have delivered." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
Senate Majority Whip, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin: "After decades of empty promises, @POTUS & Congressional Dems are successfully forcing down drug prices. First insulin to $35/month for Seniors on Medicare, & now the biggest drugs on the market." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
House Minority Leader, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries: "For far too long, pharmaceutical companies have made record profits while everyday Americans struggle to afford life-saving medications. After decades of fighting Big Pharma and their extreme MAGA Republican allies, House Democrats and the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act last year to lower costs for everyday Americans. Now, for the first time ever, Medicare has the power to negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of seniors, driving down the cost of some of the most expensive medications Americans take to treat heart disease, cancer, diabetes and more. Americans and our seniors pay more for life-saving prescription drugs than every other developed nation, often 3 to 4 times as much. This is unacceptable, it's unconscionable and it should be un-American. While extreme MAGA Republicans continue to try to unwind this progress and raise health care costs for seniors, Democrats will always put the health, safety and well-being of everyday Americans over the special interests of the wealthy, well-off and well-connected. This is a historic milestone and we're just getting started." [Statement, 8/29/23]
House Democratic Chair, California Congressman Pete Aguilar: "9 million Americans will soon be paying significantly less for 10 different, widely-used medications thanks to @HouseDemocrats and @POTUS ." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
House Minority Whip, Massachusetts Congresswoman Katherine Clark: "For decades, the rising cost of prescription drugs has forced Americans to make the impossible choice between daily necessities and life-saving medications. Today, Democrats say 'no more.' Under the leadership of President Biden, we have taken on Big Pharma and won — granting Medicare the authority to negotiate prescription drug costs directly with manufacturers through our landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Millions of Americans will have access to the medications they need at a price they can afford. Democrats are delivering on our promise to lower costs and build an America where everyone can care for themselves and their loved ones. We will continue working to put money back into the pockets of working families and grow our economy by growing the middle class." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Speaker Emeritus, California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi: "The Inflation Reduction Act was a monumental victory in Democrats' long fight to make prescription drugs more affordable: empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices. Today's announcement is an important step to delivering these lower costs to millions of America's seniors." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
Chairwoman, Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington Senator Patty Murray: "We have more to do, but this is going to bring down drug costs significantly for so many patients.

Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden: "Today marks the beginning of a new era for seniors and families that have been breaking the bank for far too long to pay for expensive prescription medicines. The products that will now be subject to negotiation are used by millions of seniors in Medicare each year, costing each of them thousands of dollars. This step, plus other cost saving measures in the Inflation Reduction Act, represent a seismic shift in the relationship between Big Pharma, the federal government, and seniors who are counting on lower prices. I will be following the negotiation process closely and will fight any attempt by Big Pharma to undo or undermine the progress that's been made." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Chairwoman, Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow: "The Inflation Reduction Act is delivering real results for Michiganders like Pam Bloink.

[Tweet, 8/29/23]
Chairman, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Delaware Senator Tom Carper: "Today's announcement is proof that the Inflation Reduction Act is working. No one should have to decide between putting food on their table and paying for prescriptions, and I was proud to lead several provisions of this life-changing legislation." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
Chairman, Senate Aging Committee, Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey: "In the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats fought hard to finally allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Because of this law, pharmaceutical companies will no longer be able to charge Medicare recipients unfair prices for the medications they need, and millions of Americans will see lower drug costs as a result. This is a huge step to lower drug costs for Americans, but it's also just the beginning. More drugs will be added to the list in the years to come, and Democrats are going to keep fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans and ensure that families don't have to choose between their health and their bank account." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Chairman, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Michigan Senator Gary Peters: "The Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices — that's one reason I fought so hard to pass it.

Today's announcement begins the process of Medicare negotiating lower prices on these ten drugs and making them more affordable for America's seniors. It marks the end of a 20-year handout from Republicans in Congress to the pharmaceutical industry that prevented Medicare from negotiating prescription drug prices for seniors. This announcement is part of Democrats' ongoing effort to lower prescription drug prices and cap seniors' Medicare Part D out-of-pocket spending. Seniors are already benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act's monthly $35 cap on insulin and penalties to pharmaceutical companies for raising prices faster than inflation. Democrats are committed to reining in the excesses of the pharmaceutical industry and lowering prescription drug prices for the American people, and today's announcement is a major step in that effort."

Pennsylvania State Senator Maria Collett: "No senior should have to choose between filling their presciption and paying rent.

AGING ADVOCATES
Jo Ann Jenkins, CEO, AARP: "BIG NEWS: Today's announcement from@CMSGov is an important first step toward allowing Medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate lower drug prices and bring relief to millions of Americans who rely on these life-sustaining medications. Despite overwhelming public support for allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices, big drug companies continue trying to stop it so they can keep padding their profits. @AARP will not back down from this fight until all older Americans can afford the medications they need." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
Nancy LeaMond, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer, AARP: "?BREAKING?: The Administration just released a list of the first 10 drugs for Medicare price negotiation. This is a critical step to bring down out-of-control drug prices. For too long, big drug companies have padded their profits at the expense of American lives. The number one reason seniors skip or ration their prescriptions is because they can't afford them. That's why AARP fought to have Medicare price negotiation passed into law . . . and why we will keep fighting against any efforts to undo or weaken it. It's impossible to overstate how monumental this law is for older Americans' financial stability and overall health." [Tweet, Statement, 8/29/23]
Judith Stein, Executive Director and Founder, Center for Medicare Advocacy: "This is the next major step in a critical effort to address out-of-control drugs costs in the Medicare program, "We applaud the Biden Administration for protecting beneficiaries' access to reasonably priced medications and the Medicare program's fiscal solvency. We urge HHS to zealously defend against baseless lawsuits filed by the pharmaceutical industry seeking to defeat these critical consumer protections." [Statement, 08/29/23]
Medicare Rights Center: "The Medicare Rights Center applauds a historic milestone achieved by the IRA through its prescription drug price negotiation program. This program will provide relief for millions of people with Medicare and reduce the difficult choices they face when it comes to affording their medications. Our national helpline receives calls daily from older adults and people with disabilities who struggle to pay for their prescriptions. Often, they have to choose between medication and basic needs like food or rent. By allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices with drug companies, the IRA will reduce the burden on beneficiaries and improve access to affordable care. These critical changes are long overdue. We look forward to the continued implementation of this landmark law. Several provisions already in place—such as no-cost Part D vaccines, lower coinsurance on some Part B drugs, and the $35 monthly insulin limit—are helping beneficiaries build health and financial security. Next year, even more Medicare enrollees will feel the law's benefits. In 2024, the IRA will expand the Part D Low Income Subsidy to help people with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level pay for their prescriptions. It will also eliminate the 5% coinsurance requirement for beneficiaries who reach the catastrophic coverage phase, finally protecting Part D enrollees from limitless and uncertain costs. These policies will meaningfully strengthen health care access and affordability for all people with Medicare." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Max Richtman, President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare: "This is an historic day in the effort to lower prescription drug prices for seniors. The Biden administration has released the names of the 10 life-saving drugs that will be subject — for the first time ever — to price negotiation between Medicare and Big Pharma. The Inflation Reduction Act provides for this reform, in addition to a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for patients' Medicare Part D drug costs and penalties for drug-makers who hike prices above the rate of inflation. Medicare price negotiation alone is expected to save seniors and taxpayers billions of dollars in drug costs over next the decade. This is a sea change in the government's ability to lower prescription drug prices for older Americans, who all too often are compelled to ration medications or forgo filling prescriptions because of soaring costs. NCPSSM has fought for Medicare to be empowered to negotiate prices for some twenty years now. We look forward to working with President Biden and the Congress to build on this groundbreaking achievement. The next step is to enlarge the number and type of medications subject to negotiation, to deliver maximum relief to seniors on fixed incomes. No one should have to choose between groceries, rent, or essential medications — especially our nation's senior citizens." [Statement, 8/29/23]
National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare: "NCPSSM policy director @danieladcock and NCPSSM president @MaxRichtman with @potus at the White House today for the release of the list of drugs for #Medicare price negotiation with #BigPharma! We have been working toward this goal for more than 20 years." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
Ramsey Alwin, CEO, National Council on Aging: "Today's announcement is a game changer for the millions of older adults who rely on these medications every day. Our research shows that the cost of chronic conditions falls heaviest on women and people of color, who have the fewest resources. Lower prices are a matter of equity. Health care and medications are the highest expenses for older adults after housing. Too often, they must make painful choices between paying for prescriptions or paying the rent. Lower drug prices can't come soon enough to relieve some of this tremendous financial pressure. In a country as rich as ours, every person should have access to affordable health care. Allowing the government to negotiate on consumers' behalf is a very welcome step in that direction." [Statement, 08/29/23]
Alex Lawson, Executive Director of Social Security Works: "Just over a year ago, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs. Today, Biden announced the first ten drugs subject to negotiation, and Big Pharma corporations are furious. These are among the most outrageously priced drugs on the market, Pharma's prized cash cows. For the first time ever, our government will stop Pharma corporations from charging as much as they want for life-saving and life-sustaining medications. Over 8 million Medicare beneficiaries rely on these medications. In 2022, Medicare spent $50.5 billion on them — about 20 percent of total Part D prescription drug costs. Beneficiaries paid $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs, which were as high as $6,497 per enrollee. This is just the beginning. Within a decade, Medicare will have the power to negotiate lower prices on well over 100 drugs. That's a huge win for seniors and people with disabilities. This is the biggest defeat Big Pharma has ever suffered — and it won't be the last. We are going to keep fighting until every single person in America can get the medications they need." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Union and Labor Leaders
Richard Fiesta, Executive Director, Alliance for Retired Americans: "It's a landmark day for older Americans. For the first time, the price Medicare pays for ten of the most expensive prescription drugs will be determined at a negotiating table, not in a corporate boardroom. This day would not have happened without the leadership of President Biden who made sure that the Inflation Reduction Act included strong action to lower the prices older Americans pay for prescription drugs. Thanks to him, seniors are paying less for some of their drugs today, and prices will continue to go down in the coming years. Of course, Americans have paid the highest prices for prescription drugs for decades and older Americans have borne the brunt of this crisis. The drug industry has had unfettered monopoly power over drug prices for too long, and we welcome this important step toward putting patients ahead of drug corporation profits." [Statement, 08/29/23]
Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers (AFT): "Where politicians of all stripes have tried and failed for decades to take on Big Pharma and curb the extortionate cost of prescription drugs, today President Joe Biden has delivered. Medicare finally has the power to bargain lower prices for tens of millions of Americans who rely on lifesaving medication but scramble desperately to afford it. And it is using that power to help our seniors. Americans will soon see deep discounts on 10 widely used drugs that currently cost $3.4 billion out of pocket—including blood thinners and treatments for diabetes, heart disease and cancer—with many more set to be added. Crucially, these negotiations will affect the broader commercial market and union members' benefit plans, reducing prices for both employers and workers. The United States shamefully pays more than any other industrialized nation for medication, and the Biden administration—and Congress—heard Americans' pleas and said, 'enough is enough.' And with insulin already capped at $35 a month for those on Medicare, the president's commitment to easing the squeeze on the middle class couldn't be clearer." [Statement, 08/29/23]

HEALTH
Ceci Connolly, Pesident and CEO, Alliance for Community Health Care Plans: "As the only national payer organization that supported robust drug pricing reform, including allowing direct government negotiation for drugs without competition, we are pleased by the White House's announcement of the first ten drugs to be negotiated. For far too long, prescription drug prices have been out of control and it's time to rein in skyrocketing drug costs. This announcement demonstrates the administration's commitment to using price negotiation to provide financial relief to consumers. 'This is a great first step for drug affordability, no matter what the bullies at Big Pharma say. Despite all their threats and lawsuits, we know we are on the right path toward better health care for all. Looking ahead, we will continue urging Congress to extend the IRA's drug negotiation provisions to the commercial market." [Statement, 8/29/23]

The CBO has estimated that the drug negotiation provision in the #InflationReductionAct will reduce the federal deficit by $100 billion over 10 years. Here's how ?? KFF explains how the drug price negotiation program will work under the law, with a focus on 2026 — the first year negotiated prices will be available. We also explain how people with Medicare may benefit from the negotiated prices. Allowing the federal government to negotiate some drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries is popular. 81% of the public — including 77% of Republicans and Republican-leaners — support this move." [Tweets, 8/29/23]
Bari Talente, Executive Vice President of Advocacy and Healthcare Access, National Multiple Sclerosis Society: "Society Applauds CMS Announcement of Prescription Drugs Selected for Medicare Negotiation. Today the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the first 10 prescription drugs that have been selected for which it will negotiate lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. This provision was included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August 2022. 'Today is an important milestone to help those who are struggling to afford medications they need to live their best lives. For the first time, CMS will be able to negotiate directly with prescription drug manufacturers to make pr2escription drugs more affordable for millions of Medicare beneficiaries while providing significant savings to the Medicare program. The 10 drugs that have been selected by CMS are used by millions of Americans every day and have been on the market for a long time, without competition from generics or biosimilars. While no MS disease-modifying therapies are currently on the list of drugs to be negotiated, we know that people with MS utilize these selected drugs to manage co-morbidities of MS.' The Society looks forward to working with the Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to implement all provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for patients' Medicare Part D drug costs and penalties for drug-makers who hike prices above the rate of inflation, to make the cost of prescription drugs more affordable and manageable for the people that need them." [Statement, 8/29/23]
David Mitchell, a Cancer Patient and Founder, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now: "This is a momentous day for patients across the country. Finally beginning to undo the nearly 20-year ban on Medicare using its purchasing power to get lower prices, Medicare will now negotiate for a better deal for these ten high-cost drugs. The list includes essential life-saving medications – cancer treatments, blood thinners, autoimmune disease treatments, diabetes drugs – that people in this country have been paying unjustified amounts for decades, while drug companies have used Medicare as a piggy bank raising prices to hit profit targets and trigger executive bonuses. I am one of millions of people in this country who take Eliquis (apixaban), a blood thinner that has a list price of almost $7,000 in the U.S. because its maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, has blocked competition. In Canada, where there is a generic, the price is less than $1,700. With negotiations, millions of patients will finally get a more affordable price for drugs like Eliquis. We look forward to continuing to work with CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure the law is implemented despite opposition from Big Pharma, and that patients finally begin to get a better deal for these ten high-priced medications and another 50 by 2029. We've been waiting far too long for this relief. This is just the beginning and we will continue pushing on all fronts to lower drug prices for everyone." [Statement, 8/29/23]

GENERAL
Tony Carrk, Executive Director, Accountable.US: "Big drug companies raked in billions in profits while standing in the way of lower prescription drug costs for millions of seniors. The time of Big Pharma grossly overcharging American seniors on life-saving medicines is coming to an end. This historic achievement is still under threat, however, because the MAGA House Majority is hellbent on repealing the Inflation Reduction Act. They would rather pad the profits of their major industry donors than help seniors who are literally choosing between food and medicines." [Statement, 8/29/23]Mayra Macías, Interim Executive Director, Building Back Together: "For the first time in our history, Medicare will have the authority to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs directly with major drug manufacturers. For years, these major drug companies have seen record-breaking profits made off the backs of Americans just trying to make ends meet and stay healthy. That ends today. For Americans who take vital medications like Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp/NovoLog, help is on the way. Today's announcement is all thanks to President Biden and Democrats in Congress' Inflation Reduction Act — and not thanks to any Republican in Congress, all of whom voted against this historic legislation. Despite the pharmaceutical industry spending nearly $400 million in lobbying last year alone to keep the cost of prescription drugs out of reach for middle-class families across the country, the Biden-Harris Administration is unwavering in their fight to lower costs and to make sure that no one is denied essential care because of cost." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Emily Gee, Senior Vice President for Inclusive Growth, Center for American Progress: "Today's announcement is a watershed moment to make lifesaving medications more affordable for millions of Americans on Medicare. Millions of seniors rely on these drugs to treat cancer, blood clots, and manage chronic conditions, including diabetes and heart failure. The Biden administration is growing the middle class by giving more Americans economic security, including better protections against high health care costs. Through negotiation, the Biden administration is taking on the greed of pharmaceutical companies, which have raked in record profits by charging Americans exorbitant prices no other country in the world would accept. It's why Big Pharma fought so hard to stop these reforms from passing in the Inflation Reduction Act and why they and their allies are suing to stop these new reforms to lower drug costs." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Fight Corporate Monopolies: "The Biden Administration isn't backing down from giant corporations. Today it announced the first 10 drugs in its new Medicare drug price program. Big Pharma will soon be forced to lower prices on some of the most widely-used drugs in the country. This is a big progressive win." [Tweet, 8/29/23]
Sky Gallegos, Executive Director, For Our Future: "Medicare's ability to negotiate prescription drug prices is a tangible example of how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering costs and how President Biden is delivering on his promises to make health care more affordable. Seniors should not have to choose between putting food on the table and life's other necessities, and taking their prescription medication. However, last year, these 10 prescription drugs alone – which treat diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and more – cost seniors on Medicare $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we are lowering these drug costs and seniors all across the country can breathe a sigh of relief. The harsh reality is, this was made possible by President Biden and Democrats in Congress despite congressional Republicans in Congress, who voted unanimously against this cost-lowering, life-saving legislation." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Kitty Richards, Executive Director, Groundwork Collaborative: "For too long, millions of Americans have been forced to pay outrageous prices for life-saving drugs while pharmaceutical companies extract record profits.

[Tweet, 8/28/23]PIRG: "The PIRG-backed Inflation Reduction Act gave the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the ability to negotiate lower prices for prescription prices. Today, CMS announced the first ten medications that will be subject to price negotiation. About 8 million people will benefit from the lower prices obtained by the strong negotiating power of the federal government. Among the medications chosen, several are wrapped in patent thickets that mean a lower-cost generic version of the drug is still years away. Price negotiation will lower the cost of these drugs, even before a competing generic makes it to market. And that means significant savings for the patients who need them." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Emma Lydon, Managing Director, P Street: "By cracking down on corporate greed and reducing the price of life-saving medications, the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats are lowering costs for millions of Americans. This is a historic achievement – one that Republican politicians and Big Pharma executives fought tooth and nail against by opposing the Inflation Reduction Act and prioritizing profits over people." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Peter Maybarduk, Director of the Access to Medicines Program, Public Citizen: "The negotiated drugs list is a watershed moment for medicine affordability. Drug corporations pretend this is a catastrophe, but I would rather see that money in seniors' pockets than Big Pharma's. Drug corporations, in crude arrogance, are suing to limit price negotiations under the IRA. But the list shows instead how important it is to expand those negotiation powers. Several monopolized drugs that are expensive for Medicare today are exempted from price negotiation, and will remain expensive. One reason for this is a many-years long grace period after a drug first comes to market. During those years, drugmakers will exploit patent monopolies with minimal checks on profiteering. That profiteering period is even longer for biologics, which comprise some of the most exorbitantly priced drugs. IRA should be expanded and consistently improved, toward supporting affordable medicine for all, rather than limited or delayed to mollify pharma monopolists. The Biden administration has our support as it resists unjust lawsuits and implements the strongest possible IRA." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Rhett Buttle, Senior Advisor, Small Business for America's Future: "Today's anticipated remarks by President Biden and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding prescription drugs is a significant stride forward in addressing the soaring cost of healthcare, a top concern in the small business community. For far too long, the rising cost of healthcare has been a huge burden on small business owners that has prevented them from hiring and retaining workers, affecting their competitiveness in the labor market and cutting into their bottom lines. Prescription drug costs are one of the key drivers of high healthcare costs. A new survey conducted by Small Business for America's Future and released today reveals 50% of respondents anticipate that the reduced costs of medications will have a positive financial impact on their businesses, their families, or their employees. The survey also found that the policy will have a direct impact on small business owners and their employees with nearly one in four small business owners having employees enrolled in Medicare and nearly a third of small business owners themselves are enrolled. Addressing healthcare costs can help continue the positive momentum of our economy with solid new jobs numbers and near record low unemployment. I am urging lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to take a strong look at other policies that can continue to help combat high healthcare costs." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Sarah Baron, Campaign Director, Unrig Our Economy: "While Biden and congressional Democrats fought fiercely to include Medicare's ability to negotiate lower drug costs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Republicans chose to vote "NO" on lower drug prices for hard-working Americans. We're thrilled to see the Administration begin to lower drug prices despite Republican opposition and look forward to seeing more drug prices negotiated down in the future." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Shelbie Swartz, Interim Executive Director, Battle Born Progress: "Today represents another major milestone in what has been a long journey toward finally making medicines affordable for millions of people in Medicare. President Biden and Democrats in Congress kept their promises to lower health costs last year by passing this historic reform that will finally enable Medicare to negotiate prices on the most expensive medicines in Part D including Xarelto, Eliquis, Januvia, Jardiance, and Xtandi. Once implemented, 5 to 7 million more Medicare patients will save money on treating everything from diabetes to cancer and taxpayers can expect to save over $98 billion over the next decade. That means people like our team member Lisa Lynn Chapman's mother, Teddie Lynn Brewer, will no longer be forced to pay exorbitant prices simply to stay healthy and can finally have some hope that the medicine they need will be affordable rather than having to skip doses, ration the medicine or go into debt to buy prescriptions. Selecting these drugs is just the first step. Now, CMS will have to move forward aggressively to negotiate with the drug corporations in order to arrive at fair prices that patients can afford. Rather than fight the new law with frivolous lawsuits, the drug corporations should cooperate. Johnson & Johnson (Jansen), Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck and Eli Lilly/Boehringer Ingelheim, and Pfizer/Astellas have made billions from patients already. Negotiations will lower prices and still allow them to make a profit but without the relentless price-gouging that hurts patients and Medicare." [Statement, 8/29/23]
Steven Hadfield of Matthews, North Carolina, who lives with a rare cancer and type 2 diabetes: "After years of having to forgo or ration some of my drugs because of their high costs, I can't tell you what it means for me to see Januvia on the list of the first drugs for Medicare negotiation,' said 'To treat my diabetes, I take Januvia, which carries a monthly list price of $547. Drugmaker Merck has made a fortune from patients like me who are forced to pay whatever price the company dictates. A fairer price for Januvia will mean a world of difference." [Statement from Patients for Affordable Drugs, 8/29/23]
Ellen Farmer, who lives in Attleboro, Massachusetts and takes blood thinner Xarelto to treat her atrial fibrillation: "I was shocked and terrified when the pharmacist told me the monthly copay for Xarelto after insurance would be $1,000. There was no way I could afford that! Johnson & Johnson, the drug company that makes Xarelto, has increased the price of its medicine by more than 111 percent since it first entered the market 12 years ago. The fact that Xarelto is on the first list of drugs to be negotiated gives me so much relief." [Statement from Patients for Affordable Drugs, 8/29/23]
Judy Aiken of Portland, Maine who lives with autoimmune disease psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis: "Enbrel costs me around $330 a month with my Medicare advantage plan – and its list price is over $7,000. This type of pricing unfairly takes advantage of those on Medicare, many of whom, like me, live on a fixed income. Seeing Enbrel on the list of drugs to be negotiated first allows me to take a deeper breath and honestly live a better life. Enbrel's high price has been a real burden, a constant anxiety. A better deal on this drug is life changing for me and thousands of patients." [Statement from Patients for Affordable Drugs, 8/29/23]
Esther Lumm, of Honest, Arizona, who lives with diabetes: "Diabetes is a life-long disease that requires constant attention and easy, reliable access to insulin and other medications to keep the disease in check. For Arizonans on Medicare like myself, rising and unpredictable prescription drug costs are a threat to our health care and to our ability to make ends meet. I'm grateful to the members of our congressional delegation who passed the Inflation Reduction Act and to the Biden administration for placing a check on the pharmaceutical corporations to make these prescriptions more affordable."

Choi, President and CEO, Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum: "We applaud the Biden administration for taking decisive action to expand benefits and lower drug costs for all Americans. We encourage drug manufacturers to work with the Biden administration to make these lifesaving and life-changing products available to recipients of Medicare at a reduced cost. For example, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are at higher risk for diabetes, and our communities have already seen the positive impact of insulin costs capped at $35 monthly under the Inflation Reduction Act.
