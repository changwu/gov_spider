    Budget Agreement
It's my honor to welcome back to the Cabinet Room leaders in the House and the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, who worked hard on the budget. There is a budget deal; it's an agreement that makes a lot of sense. In the agreement is the largest tax cut in a generation and reasonable levels of spending.
This plan could not have been done without the leadership of the Speaker and the leader of the Senate, nor could it have been done without two really fine budget chairmen, Congressman Nussle and Senator Domenici, both of whom and their staffs and their committees worked long, hard hours.
And finally, it couldn't have been done without the cooperation and work of some of our Democrat friends, Breaux in Louisiana and Miller of Georgia, Condit of California, Members around this table, who realized that it's timeâ€”it was time to come together to put a good budget together on behalf of the American people; Members who realize that what we're talking about is not partisan politics but good budget politics, good budget policy. They'll always recognize that we're here to serve the people, and this is the people's budget. It's a good budget for the working people of America, and I'm proud to congratulate you all for a job really well done.
Thank you.
