    I welcome and strongly commend the Government of South Africa's decision to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This decision reflects the growing international conviction to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as exemplified by the adherence to the treaty by other states in the region. It further demonstrates the statesmanship and vision of President de Klerk as he takes South Africa into a new era beyond apartheid and regional conflict, toward reconciliation and partnership.
I strongly urge those nations in the region who have not acceded to the treaty to do so in order to join the growing community of nations firmly bound to the principles of nuclear nonproliferation, to strengthen the international regime against the spread of nuclear weapons, and to promote the cause of peace and global cooperation.
