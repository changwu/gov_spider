    Mr. Vice President, members of the Cabinet, Mayor Lindsay, Mayor Washington, ladies and gentlemen:
This is another one of our swearing-in ceremonies and one of very great importance to this administration and also to the Nation.
Don Rumsfeld will, after his swearing in, assume several responsibilities: one is an Assistant to the President; second, as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity; and, third, as a member of the Cabinet by designation of the President. He will be the youngest member of the Cabinet, but one very experienced in all of the responsibilities that he will have. You have already met him. I have already introduced him at the time that his nomination was sent to the Senate.
Now, he will be sworn in. Judge [Austin L.] Fickling, of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, will administer the oath and Mrs. Rumsfeld will hold the Bible.
