    CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF
THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION
TO THE 74TH TACTICAL WING, VIETNAMESE AIR FORCE
The 74th Tactical Wing, Vietnamese Air Force, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in combat against an armed hostile force in South Vietnam from 1 July 1966 to 19 February 1968. During this period, the wing flew a total of 52,686 sorties, and averaged 120 percent of programmed flying time. The 520th Fighter Squadron (A-1H), 74th Tactical Wing, flew 17,730 sorties involving 24,760 flying hours, a new record for Vietnamese Air Force fighter squadrons. The officers and airmen of the wing repeatedly performed outstanding acts of heroism and gallantry, both individually and collectively, and demonstrated an esprit de corps in keeping with the highest traditions of the free military Air Forces. The 74th Tactical Wing inflicted severe damage on the hostile forces and, at the same time, saved countless Vietnamese and American lives. Despite their own tragic casualties and heavy battle damage, the men of the wing consistently maintained outstanding morale. The extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and paramount degree of professional dedication of the men of the 74th Tactical Wing reflect great credit upon themselves and the Vietnamese Air Force.
