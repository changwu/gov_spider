    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California and 23 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5546 because it (a) would establish a major new childhood vaccine compensation entitlement program without adequate data to show that such a drastic and potentially costly step is necessary, (b) is likely to do little to assure the vaccine supply or to improve our childhood immunization efforts, and (c) would restructure, in a disruptive way, well-running mechanisms for vaccine research and administration of immunization programs.
H.R. 5546 would impose an excise tax on childhood vaccines in order to finance the compensation trust fund. The Administration strongly opposes the imposition of any new tax, or any increases in existing taxes, and therefore finds the proposed excise tax in this bill unacceptable.
Should this bill be enacted, the President's senior advisors will recommend a veto.
