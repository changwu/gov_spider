.@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP 'a completely ludicrous quote' attributing it to me. This is what's going on in the age of Fake News. People think they can say anything and get away with it. Really the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable!Retweets: 24596Favorites: 90030

Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular African Americans will not be ble to vote for you. I on the other hand was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform which had tremendous support and helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!Retweets: 8242Favorites: 29265

....Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!Retweets: 22061Favorites: 82239
