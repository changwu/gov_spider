    I was gratified today to receive the final report of the White House Conference on Aging, a comprehensive look at aging policy in America developed over 2 years with the input of more than 125,000 men and women. My deep thanks and appreciation go out to all of those Americans who contributed to this incredible grassroots effort.
These recommendations, which demonstrate strong support for many of the priorities I have been fighting for, including the preservation and protection of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, will be given every serious consideration by my administration.
