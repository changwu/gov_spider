    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) Mississippi and 11 others)
The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 2344. This bill contains objectionable provisions: (1) requiring establishment of a national cemetery in Merced County, California, which would VA's long-range planning for the national cemetery system; and (2) requiring use of upright grave markers in national cemeteries, which would result in high permanent maintenance costs and an adverse impact on available grave space.
The Administration supports section 5 of H.R. 2344 which would authorize assistance to veterans who are blind or have lost, or lost the use of, both hands in acquiring a home which has already been adapted with necessary special features.
