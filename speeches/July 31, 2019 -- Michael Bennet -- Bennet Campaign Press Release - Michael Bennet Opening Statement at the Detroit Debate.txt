    Michael Bennet: Donald Trump Doesn't Give a Damn About America's Kids
DETROIT ⁠— Michael Bennet started tonight's debate by making clear that he has the strength needed to defeat Donald Trump and the vision to improve the lives of all Americans — especially the next generation. Michael's experience as the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools ⁠— a district with 95,000 kids, a majority of whom live in poverty, and a $1 billion budget larger than mostsmall towns — means he knows how critical it is to have a president who is focused on creating more opportunity for our kids and grandkids.
As Michael said in his opening statement:
"Last week, I saw one of those Trump signs that says: 'America. Love it. Or Leave it.' It was on the outside of a church.
"I love America – And I know we can make it better.
"Before coming to the Senate, I ran a large urban school district where most of the kids live in poverty. Those kids have exactly the same hopes that I had. Their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me and that Susan and I have for our three children. But for the last three years, we've been consumed by a president who, frankly, doesn't give a damn about your kids or mine.
"Mr. President – Kids belong in classrooms, not cages. And they deserve someone better than a bully in the White House.
"Let's end the three-ring circus in Washington and let's make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy.
"Empty promises can't beat Donald Trump. I can."
