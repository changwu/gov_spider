    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2133, to create the "Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission." The Commission will advise the Secretary of Education on activities to help celebrate one of the most important decisions ever issued by the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€”the decision that recognized the constitutional right to freedom from racial discrimination in our public schools. Establishing a commission to help celebrate the decision is particularly appropriate as we work to secure passage by the Congress of my Administration's educational initiatives, so that we leave no child behind.
Consistent with the requirements of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, I welcome the participation, in an advisory capacity on the commission, of representatives of the Judiciary; the Brown Foundation for Education Equity, Excellence, and Research; the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund; and the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in the activities of the commission. While the Constitution does not permit them to participate in the performance of executive functions, their advice will be crucial to the effective functioning of the commission. As I exercise my constitutional power of appointment to name 11 members of the commission, under the Appointments Clause and the enabling legislation, I welcome, as a matter of comity, the suggestions of the congressional leadership for those positions.
I look forward to the national celebration in 2004 of the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
