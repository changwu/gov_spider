.@TheIranDeal, why does Iranian Government still chant death to America?

.@TheIranDeal, why didn't you force Iran to free American hostages?

.@TheIranDeal, why did you make a deal with United Nations before the US Congress? Shows us where your priorities are.

.@TheIranDeal, why do you keep trying appeasement? It never works, and it's shameful that you are even trying it.
