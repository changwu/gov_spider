    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Eleventh Annual Report of the National Science Board, Science Indicators—1978. This report is the fourth in a series examining important aspects of the state of American science and technology.
Science and technology play a vital role in maintaining our Nation's economic well-being and make fundamental contributions toward the solution of many of our social problems. As this report illustrates, the United States continues to rank high internationally in most areas of science.
Science indicators—1978 also addresses the balance between fundamental or longterm research and shorter-term applied research and development. Proper investment in basic research is crucial to using and maintaining the Nation's scientific and technical talent. My 1980 budget reflects this Administration's desire to increase support of scientific research and development as an investment in the Nation's future.
This report should be of interest to all those concerned with the Nation's scientific effort. I commend Science indicators—1978 to the attention of the Congress and those in the scientific endeavor.
