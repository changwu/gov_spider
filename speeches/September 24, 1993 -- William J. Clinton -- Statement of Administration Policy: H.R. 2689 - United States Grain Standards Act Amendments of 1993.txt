    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(de la Garza (D) TX and five others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2689. However, the Administration will urge the Senate to defer consideration of the reauthorization of the Federal Grain Inspection Service Advisory Committee. Under Executive Order 12838, a detailed, review of the justification of all advisory commissions is underway. As a general policy, statutory commissions should not be extended pending completion of the review.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2689 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero.
