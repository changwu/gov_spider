    I have been advised that the Department of Justice has announced that the United States will participate in voting rights litigation in three States to defend minority voting opportunities. The legal action taken today in cases in North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas reaffirms my administration's strong commitment to defend the historic gains made under the Voting Rights Act.
The Voting Rights Act ensures that all Americans may fully participate in the democratic process. In recent years, our Nation has enjoyed a tremendous increase in minority voter access to our electoral system. These hard-won victories must not be abandoned. I applaud the forceful actions of Attorney General Reno and the Justice Department to ensure that voting rights are vigorously protected.
