    Today, I have signed into law S. 2736, the "Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018" (the "Act"). Several provisions of the Act, including sections 101, 102, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 208, 209, 210, 211, 213, 216, 306, 307, 406, and 410, purport to dictate the policy of the United States in external military and foreign affairs, or to require the executive branch to undertake certain diplomatic initiatives with international partners. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the United States in foreign affairs. Other provisions of the bill, including sections 201 and 213, purport to restrict the President's authority to control the personnel and materiel the President believes are necessary or advisable for the successful conduct of military operations. While I share the objectives of the Congress with respect to maintaining the strength and security of the United States, my Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Finally, a number of provisions in the bill, including sections 210 and 214, purport to mandate or regulate submission to the Congress or publication of information protected by executive privilege. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority to withhold information, the disclosure of which could impair national security, foreign relations, or the performance of the President's constitutional duties.
