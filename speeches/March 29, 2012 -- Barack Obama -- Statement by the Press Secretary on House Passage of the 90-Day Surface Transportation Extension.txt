    While it is critical that we not put American jobs and safety at risk and hurt our economic recovery by allowing funding to run out, it is not enough for us to continue to patch together our nation's infrastructure future with short-term band-aids. States and cities need certainty to plan ahead and America's construction workers deserve the peace of mind that they won't have to worry about their jobs every few months.
The Senate has done its part, passing a bipartisan bill with 52 Democrats and 22 Republicans that would keep American workers on the job maintaining our roads, bridges, and railways. As soon as the House gets back to work, they should do their part and pass that bill in similarly bipartisan fashion.
