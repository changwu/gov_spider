    Today Carson for President announced enhancements, which will shift the campaign into a higher gear, bringing the unique qualifications of Dr. Ben Carson into even better focus for the American people.
Major General Bob Dees, U.S. Army, Retired, will provide overarching leadership to our talented and growing team as campaign chairman.
Ed Brookover who formerly served as senior strategist will serve as campaign manager.
From Dr. Carson:
"As we enter a new phase of the campaign cycle, it is necessary to invigorate my campaign with a strategy that more aggressively shares my vision and world-view with the American people. I commend Barry Bennett and Doug Watts for their efforts to help me share my vision for America."
"Over a year ago, hundreds of thousands of Americans encouraged me to listen to the call and seek the office of president of the greatest nation the world has ever known. I am ready to be president and believe that my unique experience and background is what is needed to heal, inspire and revive America."
Carson for President is fired up about the New Year, recognizing that these positive changes will create even greater effectiveness on behalf of Dr. Carson. While many candidates have fans, Dr. Carson has true believers across America and the world. We are encouraged that Americans will soon refocus on Dr. Ben Carson as the candidate with unequaled character, integrity, courage, coolness under fire, and common sense solutions to address the great challenges America faces.
