    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Tauzin (D) Louisiana and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2459 unless it is amended to delete provisions which would:

establish inflexible "line item" authorizations for Acquisition and Construction projects, thereby limiting the Coast Guard's ability to allocate funds to projects as priorities change;
unduly restrict the flexibility of the Coast Guard to respond to changing national demands by prohibiting reduction of any other services to increase drug law enforcement;
prematurely expand restrictions on Federal law enforcement agencies engaged in drug interdiction by requiring expanded "constructive" seizure procedures for commercial vessels, regardless of the quantity of drugs found on the vessel when it was seized. (The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 required the Departments of the Treasury, Justice, and Transportation to develop and implement procedures to protect innocent vessel owners. Such procedures have been implemented, and the protection they offer such owners should be evaluated before any further requirements are imposed statutorily.); and
hinder the development of a coordinated, nationwide approach to vessel traffic service by mandating vessel traffic service in specific localities.
