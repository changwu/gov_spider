    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the one year anniversary of South Sudan's independence:
"I congratulate the people of South Sudan on their first anniversary as a free and independent nation. This is a day of celebration. But it is also a day to remember the heartbreaking sacrifices the South Sudanese have made, to recognize the challenges that still lie ahead, and to reaffirm the goal of securing South Sudan's future. I believe America must play a leadership role in this process and speak clearly on the ongoing atrocities of the regime in Khartoum and the resulting refugee crisis. I am committed to protecting innocents, ensuring access to humanitarian aid, and achieving a just and sustainable peace between South Sudan and Sudan. I have the highest hopes for South Sudan and the greatest expectations that it will one day serve as an example to other countries that rise from struggle to achieve a better future."
