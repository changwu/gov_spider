    I am pleased to nominate Lt. Gen. Charles C. Krulak, U.S. Marine Corps, for appointment to the grade of general and as Commandant of the Marine Corps, succeeding Gen. Carl E. Mundy, Jr., who is retiring.
I have asked the Secretary of the Navy to announce my decision today in ceremonies at Iwo Jima commemorating the 50th anniversary of the battle.
General Krulak currently serves as Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific, and Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force Pacific. In this capacity, he is responsible for Marine Corps units and activities throughout the Pacific theater. During his distinguished career, General Krulak served two command tours in Vietnam, oversaw the Marine Corps logistic efforts during Desert Storm, and was responsible for significant and innovative changes in military doctrine and organization. He brings to the job of Commandant a dynamic vision of the Marine Corps' future, a wealth of experience, and a highly effective leadership and managerial style.
General Krulak assumes the post of Commandant of the Marine Corps at an important time in the U.S. Marine Corps' history. I will depend on him to continue General Mundy's superb efforts in ensuring that the Marine Corps its important responsibilities under our national remains fully ready and able in carrying out security strategy.
