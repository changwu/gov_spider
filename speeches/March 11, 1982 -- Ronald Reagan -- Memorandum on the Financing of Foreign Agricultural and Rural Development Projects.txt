    Presidential Determination No. 82-10
Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture
Subject: Waiver of Section 302(c)(1)(C) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (P.L. 80)â€”Title III Food For Development
Pursuant to the authority vested in me under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (hereinafter termed "the Act"), I hereby:
Determine that in fiscal year 1981 there were an insufficient number of agricultural and rural development projects which qualified for assistance under Title III of the Act and that therefore the humanitarian purposes of the Act were better served by furnishing financing under other provisions of the Act. Therefore, I waive the minimum requirement of Section 302(c)(i)(C) of the Act with respect to fiscal year 1981.
