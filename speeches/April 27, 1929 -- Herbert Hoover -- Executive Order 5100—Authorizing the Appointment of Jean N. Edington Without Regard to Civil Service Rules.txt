    Mrs. Jean N. Edington may be appointed to an appropriate position in the classified service without regard to the requirements of the civil service rules. She is wholly dependent upon her own resources and has two children, eight and six years of age, who are partially dependent upon her, these conditions being brought about by the illness of her husband, Mr. Wallace D. Edington, formerly a junior chemist in the Department of Agriculture, who is a patient for an indefinite period in the Springfield State Hospital for the Insane at Sykesville, Maryland.
This order is favored by the Secretary of Agriculture, in whose Department Mrs. Edington has been employed temporarily, and by the Secretary of Commerce, who states that the Department of Commerce will be glad to extend to Mrs. Edington an appointment if an order is issued. The Civil Service Commission, being limited in its recommendations to those cases where a waiver of the rules will more fully meet the needs of the service, is unable to concur.
