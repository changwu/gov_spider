"I am so honored to earn Dave's support," said Mitt Romney. "For years, Dave has a been a respected conservative leader in the House and shares my vision of fighting out of control spending, making entitlements more sustainable, and working to restore our nation's fiscal health. I look forward to working with Dave in the months ahead to spread this message both to our home state of Michigan and the entire country."
Announcing his support, Michigan Congressman Dave Camp said, "No candidate in this race will be more committed to getting Michigan on a path to recovery than Mitt Romney who was born and raised here. For the last three years, our country has seen growing debt, rising unemployment, and a middle class weakened by President Obama's failed policies. We need a leader who understands the economic challenges America faces. Whether it was during his time in the real economy, saving the Winter Olympics, or pulling Massachusetts out of a massive budget deficit, Mitt Romney has proven time and again that he can turn around troubled enterprises. He is the conservative candidate who will reverse President Obama's failed policies and rebuild the middle class. I am proud to stand with him."
