    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Nadler, D-NY, and 177 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act. The President has called on Congress to act now to reduce gun violence and save lives. This legislation would make significant progress toward delivering on that call to action.
The President supports common-sense measures to keep guns out of dangerous hands. The Protecting Our Kids Act would ensure that individuals under 21 years of age cannot purchase weapons of war. The bill would also make firearms trafficking a distinct Federal crime - giving prosecutors the tools they need to hold accountable the people responsible for the flow of firearms to the hands of criminals. The bill would promote responsible maintenance of firearms and hold adults accountable if they fail to safely store their firearms, thereby giving access to a minor or someone otherwise unauthorized to possess a firearm.
The President also supports common-sense measures to keep dangerous weapons off our streets. The Protecting Our Kids Act would ban the sale and possession of large-capacity magazines and clarify that bump stocks, which allow individuals to convert semiautomatic weapons into machineguns, are banned under Federal law. The bill would also ban the manufacture, sale, or possession of a "ghost gun" - a firearm without a serial number. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns. Congress must now take the next step to further promote gun safety by passing the Protecting Our Kids Act.
The Administration urges the Congress to pass the Protecting Our Kids Act and send the measure to the President's desk.
