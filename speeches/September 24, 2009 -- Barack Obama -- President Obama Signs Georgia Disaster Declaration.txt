    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Georgia and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding beginning on September 18, 2009, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in Carroll, Cherokee, Cobb, Douglas, and Paulding Counties.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
