The so-called Whistleblower's account of my perfect phone call is 'way off' not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!Retweets: 26482Favorites: 105078

Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on China pertained to corruption not politics.

Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him) and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn't give it to him). He is so bad for R's!Retweets: 36085Favorites: 144648
