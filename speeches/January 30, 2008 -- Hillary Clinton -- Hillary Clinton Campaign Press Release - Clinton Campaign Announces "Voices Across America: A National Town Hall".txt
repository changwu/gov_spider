    On Monday February 4, 2008, the Clinton campaign will host an unprecedented live webcast town hall with 21 Super Tuesday states participating simultaneously in the conversation by satellite. It will be the first time in presidential campaign history that voters in the Super Tuesday states can have their voices heard in a single national town hall. The event, called "Voices Across America: A National Town Hall" will be simulcast starting at 9 p.m. EST on www.hillaryclinton.com.
"On Super Tuesday, millions of Americans will have an opportunity to have their voices heard in this important election," said Hillary Clinton. "This national town hall will allow all voters to participate in the conversation that I began with the American public a year ago and discuss the issues that matter to them so they can be fully informed when they cast their ballot the following day. From a faltering economy to the many challenges we face abroad, Americans are ready for a president who will deliver the real solutions we need."
The 22 cities where the campaign will host events are Birmingham, AL; Phoenix, AZ; Little Rock, AR; Los Angeles, CA; San Francisco, CA; Denver, CO; Hartford, CT; Wilmington, DE; Athens, GA; Boise, ID; Chicago, IL; Wichita, KS; Boston, MA; St. Paul, MN; Kansas City, MO; Cherry Hill, NJ; Albuquerque, NM; New York, NY; Grand Forks, ND; Tulsa, OK; Knoxville, TN; Salt Lake City, UT.
Hillary Clinton will anchor the town hall in New York, while President Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, and national and local surrogates will serve as hosts at events in the other states. Voters attending the events will be able to ask questions from these satellite events directly to Hillary Clinton in New York. In addition, Clinton will take questions submitted by voters online at www.hillaryclinton.com/townhall.
