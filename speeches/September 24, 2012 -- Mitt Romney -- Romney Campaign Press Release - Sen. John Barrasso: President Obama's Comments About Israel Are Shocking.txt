    Wyoming Senator John Barrasso today made the following statement on President Obama calling Israel's concerns about an Iran armed with nuclear weapons "noise": 
"Not even under Jimmy Carter did relations the United States and Israel sink as low as they have fallen under Barack Obama. The President's interview last night on 60 Minutes is a shocking demonstration of how bad things have become.  This is a moment of peril for Israel. Iran, a state whose leaders call for Israel's annihilation, is getting ever closer to obtaining nuclear weapons. But President Obama dismisses Israel's expression of its fears as mere 'noise' that he intends to 'block out.' In the same interview, he no longer calls Israel 'our closest ally' in the Middle East. Instead, he has relegated Israel to a second tier, one of several 'close allies.' We are seeing a mere foretaste of what a second term for President Obama would bring to U.S.-Israeli relations. It's time America had a president who treated Israel like the close partner to the United States that it is."
