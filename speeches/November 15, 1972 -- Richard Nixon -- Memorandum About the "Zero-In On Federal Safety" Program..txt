    Memorandum for Heads of Federal Departments and Agencies:
In 1971, I initiated the "Zero-In On Federal Safety" Program to replace "Mission Safety 70." The value of the "Zero-In" program was clearly demonstrated during that year when the frequency rate of disabling injuries dropped by nine percent over 1970. The 1971 rate of 6.0 disabling injuries per million man-hours worked is in fact the lowest ever achieved in the Federal Government.
This downward trend must be continued.
In an effort to obtain greater benefits from this program and to carry out our responsibility under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, I am extending the program of "Zero-In On Federal Safety" through December, 1973. In addition, we must develop a concerted effort to reduce occupational health hazards which may be present in Government workplaces.
Each agency is hereby directed to establish means to meet these objectives. The Secretary of Labor will outline a suggested program for all agencies to follow. Specific guidelines and materials will be provided through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.
It is my sincere hope that you will continue to give your fullest support to the "Zero-In On Federal Safety" program during 1973. Through its effective implementation, the Federal Government--as the Nation's largest employer--will set an example for all.
