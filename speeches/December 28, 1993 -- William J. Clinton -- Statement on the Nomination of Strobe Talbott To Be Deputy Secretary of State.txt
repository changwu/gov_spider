    I am delighted by the decision of Secretary of State Warren Christopher to nominate Ambassador Strobe Talbott to become Deputy Secretary of State. I have known and respected Ambassador Talbott for over 25 years and have always found him to be a man of great ability, intellect, and vision. He has performed superbly in his current role as Ambassador at Large for the former Soviet Republics, and I have full confidence in his ability to perform equally well in this new capacity at the Department of State.
