    Biden will eliminate fracking. It's a matter of when, not if.

There is no question that Pennsylvania fracking workers will be decimated if Joe Biden is elected. It's just a matter of when, not if, those workers will lose their jobs. Yet Biden told another lie about his position on fracking during an interview in Pittsburgh when he claimed that he has "never told the environmentalists that I'm going to ban fracking. Period."
This is demonstrably false. Biden has told far-left activists on at least four occasions that he dreams about ending fracking and eliminating fossil fuels:

"What about, say, stopping fracking?" an activist asked Biden in January. "Yes!" Biden replied enthusiastically. "Yes! Exactly!"
When an activist told Biden in December that he "would love to" ban fracking, Biden replied "I'd love to, too. I'd love to make sure we can't use any oil or gas. Period. Now."
"Look in my eyes," Biden solemnly told a young woman last year. "I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel."
"We are going to get rid of fossil fuels," Biden told a crowd of activists at an event in New Hampshire in February.

Biden has also said multiple times in debates that he would eliminate fossil fuels. Hundreds of thousands of fracking and natural gas jobs in Pennsylvania – and millions of American energy jobs across the country – are on the chopping block in a Biden presidency. It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.
