    Romney for President released a new television advertisement titled "Conservative Record." The advertisement will run in Wisconsin. Mitt Romney spent his career in the private sector and used the lessons he learned in business to close a $3 billion budget gap without raising taxes and leave a $2 billion rainy day fund when he was governor. Mitt Romney will bring these principles to Washington to cut spending and get the government out of the way of the private sector.
