    I send greetings to those celebrating Rosh Hashanah.
On this occasion of spiritual reflection, people of the Jewish faith in our country and around the world recognize the blessings from the Almighty as they commemorate the anniversary of the creation of the world. During this holy time, men and women take time to remember the past, contemplate the sweetness of the new year, and look forward to a promising future.
This special occasion is also an opportunity to celebrate the history of the Jewish people and the values that bind us all together.
Laura and I send our best wishes for a meaningful Rosh Hashanah and L'shanah tovah.
