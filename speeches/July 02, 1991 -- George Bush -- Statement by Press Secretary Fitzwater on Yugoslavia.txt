    The President deeply regrets the resumption of violent conflict in Yugoslavia and urges all parties to observe the cease-fire agreement worked out with representatives of the European Community. He also urges Yugoslav authorities to accept an EC offer of international cease-fire observers. The United States is prepared to endorse such a plan at tomorrow's emergency meeting in Prague of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The President has written a letter to President Mesic of Yugoslavia expressing his grave concern over the situation in the country and urging him to ensure that civilian control over the military is reestablished and peace restored. He also expressed the hope that all parties in Yugoslavia would seek a dialog toward a new and democratic basis for Yugoslavia's future, in which the aspirations of all the Yugoslav peoples can be realized. The President reiterated U.S. support for the European Community's ongoing efforts to help resolve the Yugoslav crisis and urged President Mesic to continue cooperating with the United States, the EC, and others in the interest of a peaceful transition to a new Yugoslavia.
