    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital and to Certain Other Taxes, together with a related Protocol, signed at Bonn on August 29, 1989. I also transmit the report of the Department of State on the convention.
The convention replaces the tax convention that was signed with the Federal Republic of Germany on July 22, 1954, and amended by the protocol of September 17, 1965. It is based on model income tax treaties developed by the Department of the Treasury and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, it includes a number of new provisions to accommodate important aspects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, such as the imposition of a branch tax and strong measures to prevent "treaty shopping."
I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention, together with a related protocol, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
George Bush
