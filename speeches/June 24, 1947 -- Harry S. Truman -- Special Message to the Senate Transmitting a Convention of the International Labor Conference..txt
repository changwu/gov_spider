    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith an authentic text of the Final Articles Revision Convention, 1946 (No. 80), adopted at the Twenty-ninth Session of the International Labor Conference at Montreal on October 9, 1946. In my opinion this Convention is essential to bring the language of previously adopted Conventions into conformity with present conditions and specifically to recognize the present relationship of the International Labor Organization to the United Nations under Article 57 of the Charter of the United Nations.
This Convention was adopted unanimously by the Conference. On the part of the United States delegation, affirmative votes were cast by the two Government delegates, by the delegate representing employers, and by the delegate representing workers.
The purpose of the Convention is to make verbal changes in the texts of Conventions adopted at the previous twenty-eight sessions and to assign responsibility to the Director-General of the International Labor Office for certain of the chancery functions for which previously the Secretary-General of the League of Nations was responsible.
The effect of this Convention is described in more detail in the report of the Secretary of State, enclosed herewith, and in a communication from the Secretary of Labor, a copy of which is enclosed.
