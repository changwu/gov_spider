    Earlier today, the President signed S. 3104, legislation that provides permanent authorization for Radio Free Asia (RFA). The mission of Radio Free Asia directly reflects the value Americans place on freedom of and access to information, which are vital to the democratic process and consistent with the principles of freedom of opinion and expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Over the last 14 years, RFA has brought accurate and timely news to the people of seven Asian countries without a free press. Starting with just two language services, it now broadcasts in nine Asian languages and numerous dialects. It has been honored with a wide variety of prestigious journalism awards over the years for providing factual and impartial news as well as analysis, commentary, and cultural programming.
We will continue to work closely with Congress to support the critical work of RFA, and thank Senator Lugar and Representative Royce for their leadership in advancing this legislation. We look forward to increasing RFAâ€™s audience reach in the years to come.
