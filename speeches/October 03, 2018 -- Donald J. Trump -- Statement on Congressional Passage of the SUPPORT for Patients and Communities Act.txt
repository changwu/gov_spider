    I applaud Congress for its extraordinary bipartisan effort and steadfast commitment to mobilizing the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis. Since day one of my administration, addressing this crisis has been a top priority. That is why I directed my administration to dedicate unprecedented resources toward diminishing the devastating toll it has inflicted on communities throughout our country.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) makes important investments that will lift people out of addiction, help keep illicit drugs out of our communities, expand public awareness and prevention initiatives to stop addiction before it starts, and save lives.
I want to thank the leaders of the many committees in the House and Senate who contributed to this landmark legislation and recognize their remarkable leadership in strengthening our public health and safety responses. I look forward to signing this historic legislation.
