    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Waxman (D) California)
The Administration supports the "sunset" provision contained in H.R. 3010 which would repeal the health planning program authorities effective October 1, 1986; but would favor an amendment reducing the authorization level for fiscal year 1986 from $64.9 million to that consistent with the President's Budget.
