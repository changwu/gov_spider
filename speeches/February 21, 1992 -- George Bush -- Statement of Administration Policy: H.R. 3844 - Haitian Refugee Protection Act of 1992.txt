    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 2/24/92)(House Rules)(Mazzoli (D) Kentucky)
The Administration is committed to repatriating only those Haitians who do not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. Specially trained Immigration and Naturalization Service Asylum Corps officers are carefully interviewing Haitians to identify those who might have such a fear of persecution.
However, if H.R. 3844 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend a veto because it:

—  Could encourage Haitians to risk their lives on the high seas by leaving Haiti in unseaworthy boats. Because the bill would lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate immigration status of the Haitians, they will mistakenly believe that they will be permitted to stay in the United States.
—  Would potentially overwhelm the Government's capacity to house and process such a large number of asylum seekers.
—  Fails to distinguish between Haitians with legitimate claims to asylum and those who do not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.
—  Interferes with the President's constitutional power to conduct foreign affairs and act as Commander in Chief.
—  Prescribes how the President should make or alter his determination of annual refugee admission allocations, which would contradict both the letter and the spirit of the Refugee Act of 1980.
