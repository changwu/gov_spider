Script For "Energy Security" (Web 1:00) 
CHYRON: A reliance on oil
A threat to our climate.
A threat to our economy.
A threat to national security. 
JOHN MCCAIN: "Much of the world's oil supply is controlled by states, regimes and a cartel for which America's well being is not exactly a priority."
"We must shift our entire energy economy toward new and cleaner power sources such as wind, solar, biofuels. It will include a variety of new automotive and fuel technologies, clean-burning coal and nuclear energy." 
CHYRON: Shift our economy.
Alternative energy.
Plug-in and hybrid.
Clean coal.
Nuclear energy. 
JOHN MCCAIN: "The next president must be willing to break with the energy policies not just of the current Administration, but the administrations that preceded it, and lead a great national campaign to achieve energy security for America." 
CHYRON: End the federal moratorium on drilling.
Clean technologies.
Energy security. 
JOHN MCCAIN: "I know how to do that and I will do it my friends."
