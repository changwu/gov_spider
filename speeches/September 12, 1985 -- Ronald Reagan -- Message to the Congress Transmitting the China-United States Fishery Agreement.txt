    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), (the Act), I transmit herewith the text of the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of the People's Republic of China, which was signed at Washington on July 23, 1985.
This agreement is one of a series negotiated in accordance with the Act. It is the first such agreement to be concluded that incorporates the 1984 amendments to the Act, clearly establishing the relationship between a foreign nation's allocations requests and its contributions to the development of the U.S. fishery in which it is requesting allocations. This agreement will further the objectives of the Act and will serve to enhance relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China.
I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
