    40 elected officials, more than 80 community leaders, and more than 200 academics throw their support behind Sen. Sanders
CALIFORNIA – Ahead of Sen. Sanders' rally in Los Angeles with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez today, 40 elected officials, more than 80 community leaders, and more than 200 academics in the Golden State announce their support behind Sen. Sanders' candidacy for President of the United States, demonstrating the growing momentum of the Bernie 2020 campaign in California.
The endorsements are in addition to 86 earlier endorsements from elected leaders, two major labor endorsements from National Nurses United and United Teachers Los Angeles, the grassroots network Bay Area Rising, the entire City Council of Coachella, and a statewide endorsement from the California Young Democrats.
"Having fought for the rights and dignity of working immigrant women for two decades, I trust Bernie Sanders to be a champion for justice for all of us," said Oakland City Councilmember Nikki Bas. "Our nation needs a bold, principled leader who will end status quo politics and put the needs of everyday people before corporate profits. We must build a massive movement to win national rent control, deep investments in affordable housing, Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, immigration reform, and just alternatives to mass incarceration. I'm endorsing Bernie Sanders because he is building a movement to create a country that cares for all our families."
"Bernie Sanders is the child of immigrants - people who worked hard and who struggled to make a life in this country," said Los Angeles City Councilmember Gil Cedillo. "That is where he comes from, that is who he is. Bernie Sanders has been explicitly articulating every single thing that we have been fighting for our entire lives. I still stand behind my words that not since the Rainbow Coalition of 1988 have we seen such a diverse and progressive movement for the heart and soul of the Democratic Party under the leadership of Bernie Sanders. Our nation needs a revolutionary movement and there is no other viable candidate to carry out our agenda backed by our core values. I stood with Bernie in 2016, and I am even more proud to stand with him today, and endorse his candidacy as the next President of the United States."
"We need a president who is committed to caring for the people of this country--from the men and women who bravely wore our nation's uniform to the young people who are sleeping on our streets," said Will Rodriguez-Kennedy, President of the California Young Democrats. "Bernie Sanders has always fulfilled our moral obligation to lift up all Americans and give them the opportunities they deserve to thrive."
"Bernie Sanders' prophetic call to love and compassion is finding an answering cry for justice, especially among those who have suffered too hard for too long," said Anna Harrison, Associate Professor of Theological Studies at Loyola Marymount University. "His clarion cry, 'Not me. Us,' is our best hope for the future."
"We are proud to have the endorsement of some of California's most progressive and dedicated elected officials, community leaders, and academics," said Rafael Návar, Bernie 2020 California State Director. "We have the grassroots support we need to win this election, and with these leaders on our side, Bernie Sanders will become the next President of the United States."
