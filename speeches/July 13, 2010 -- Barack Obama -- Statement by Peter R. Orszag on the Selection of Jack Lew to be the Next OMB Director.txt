    "I have known Jack Lew for more than a decade, have worked with him under two Presidents, and value his counsel and friendship. After bringing the economy back from the brink of a depression and onto the road to recovery, the nation still faces significant fiscal challenges that, as the President has noted, will require some tough choices in the months to come. With his experience, mastery of the budget process, and passion for public service, Jack Lew is an individual especially qualified to serve the President and the American people during these challenging economic times. I congratulate Jack on his selection, and will do what I can to support him, the economic team, and the President as they work to put our country on a sustainable fiscal path."
