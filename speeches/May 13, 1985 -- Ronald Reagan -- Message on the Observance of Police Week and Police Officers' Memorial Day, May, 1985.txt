    At this time each year we stop a moment to remember those law enforcement officers who have given their lives in the line of duty.
Few of us take the time to consider how much we rely on these individuals who defend the principles of law and order that uphold our nation. Our police officers preserve our rights while protecting us from those who would abuse them.
Every year, tragically, some among the ranks of these brave men and women sacrifice their lives in the performance of their jobs. The giving of this most precious possession, life itself, is a dramatic demonstration of the intense dedication and selfless service of those who keep the peace and safeguard our lives and property each and every day. Let us resolve to do all in our power as citizens of these United States to support our law enforcement officers in their work and pray that no more of them are taken from their families and those they so ably serve. In this way, those who have laid down their lives for their fellowman will not have died in vain.
