    Dear Claude:
With great personal regret I am accepting your resignation as Secretary of Agriculture to take effect on the appointment and qualification of your successor.
You have served more than four years in that office. During that time the agricultural output of the United States reached unprecedented levels. Under your administration the farmers of the nation have performed miracles of production of foods and fibres which did so much to win the war in Europe and to place us on the road to victory in the Pacific.
It is a record from which, I am sure, you must derive much satisfaction and pride.
On behalf of our Government, I desire to thank you for your patriotic and devoted service.
I also wish to thank you for consenting to remain in government as the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration. The work of this agency means much for the comfort and efficiency of our rural dwellers. I am delighted that it will be in the hands of one who has so competently and tirelessly worked for their welfare.
As problems arise in the field of agriculture, I expect to call upon you for advice and assistance.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
