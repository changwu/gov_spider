    MRS. NIXON and I are both deeply saddened by the death of the Duke of Windsor. He was a man of noble spirit and high ideals, for whom millions of Americans felt a deep respect and affection. We join in extending our profound sympathy to the Duchess, and to the many others who will mourn his passing.
