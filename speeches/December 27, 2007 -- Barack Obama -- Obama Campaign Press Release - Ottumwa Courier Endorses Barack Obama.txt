    Says Obama Will Create Change and Inspire Others to do the Same
Des Moines, IA -- Today, citing his "consistent opposition" to the war in Iraq and his ability to "create change," and "inspire others to do the same," the Ottumwa Courier endorsed U.S. Senator Barack Obama for President.
Obama has also been endorsed by the Sioux City Journal, Iowa City Press Citizen, Woodbine Twiner/Logan Herald-Observer, Daily Iowan, Iowa State Daily and Des Moines' El Latino.
Below are excerpts from the editorial:
Americans clamor for change. And every election cycle, a candidate or several candidates will offer his/her ideas on how they would change the course of American governance. But Iowa Democrats have a real choice next month and there is one politician who we believe will not only create change, he'll inspire others to do the same. Barack Obama has earned our support in the Iowa caucuses.
...
On the war in Iraq, Obama has been consistent about his opposition to the war and his desire to move troops out as soon as possible.
...
Obama suggests that there is a tendency not to count state and local work as real-world experience. However, much of his time doing that work has meant working across the aisle and getting things done. Obama knows he must surround himself with people who will help him move the country down a prosperous path.
...
Obama's message is clear: "People want an affirmation. They want to believe that we can still come together as a country. They want a higher purpose. They want to know that we can stick together." With Obama, we're ready to do just that.
