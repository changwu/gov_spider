    Laura Bush will initiate a series of nightly holiday bedtime stories on the White House web site (www.whitehouse.gov) by reading "Angelina's Christmas," by Katharine Holabird, on Monday at 8:00 p.m. (Eastern Time).
Following tonight's reading, every weeknight at 8:00 p.m., new bedtime stories will be read by White House and administration officials.
Former First Lady Barbara Bush, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Treasury Secretary John Snow, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Education Secretary Rod Paige and OMB Director Josh Bolten are scheduled to read bedtime stories.
The bedtime story videos are just part of the White House holiday section. Other features which can be found at www.whitehouse.gov/holiday include the new Barney Cam video, "Barney Cam II: Barney Reloaded," the 2003 White House holiday book, 360 degree views of the decorated state rooms, historic photos of holidays at the White House and Presidential holiday cards dating back to the Roosevelt administration.
