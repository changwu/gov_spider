(House)(Young (R) AK)
On August 13, 1996, the President signed into law the Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification Act (Public Law 104-185). This Act improves and streamlines the Federal royalty payment program. The Administration supports H.R. ____ [4018] which represents a timely, bi-partisan, cooperative effort to correct inadvertent errors contained in Public Law 104-185, and which will ensure the sound and effective implementation of the Royalty Simplification Act.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. ____ [4018] would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
