    I am pleased by today's action in the Senate on the Alaska lands bill. The full Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation that guarantees essential protection for the nationally significant natural resources in Alaska, allows for needed development of Alaska's valuable energy potential, and provides opportunities for economic growth for all the citizens of that State. In significant measure, this bill closely resembles the proposals I sent to the Congress more than 3 years ago. It is a victory in the long struggle to resolve this issue.
The bill designates more than 43 million acres of National Park System lands, 54 million acres of National Wildlife Refuges, 56 million acres of wilderness, and 1.3 million acres of National Wild and Scenic Rivers. In essence, the "crown jewels" of the Alaskan natural wonders are afforded protection. At the same time, the bill provides for development of Alaska's oil, gas, mineral, and timber resources while conveying to the State and native communities lands of interest to them.
The resolution of the Alaska lands question is the most important conservation measure to come before any Congress or any President in this century. It has been my highest environmental priority since taking office, and I want to congratulate the Senate for its perseverance and patience in taking this historic step today.
Passage of this bill has taken the hard work and leadership of Senators Jackson and Tsongas and the help of many of their colleagues, including Senators Cranston, Hart, Nelson, Culver, Levin, McGovern, Randolph, Church, Chafee, Roth, Hatfield, Proxmire, Eagleton, and Mathias. The Senate has now greatly increased the chances that we will have an Alaska lands bill passed in this session of Congress. The House has already passed a strong Alaska lands bill, and I am hopeful that the House and Senate will be able to reach agreement on a final bill that I will be proud to sign.
