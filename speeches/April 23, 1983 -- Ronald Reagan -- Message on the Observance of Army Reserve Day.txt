    Established on April 23 seventy-five years ago, the United States Army Reserve traces its roots to the proud tradition of the citizen-soldier of the American Revolution. Created as the Medical Reserve Corps, the Army Reserve has become the largest Federal Reserve component in the Armed Forces of the United States. It now is composed of Army Reserve Troop Units, the Individual Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve.
Since 1908, Army Reservists have been called to active duty in emergencies. Almost 170,000 Reservists served in World War I. In World War II, an estimated 217,250 soldiers were mobilized from the Army Reserve to fight in the European and Pacific Theaters of war. Army Reservists also served with pride and distinction during the Korean War, the Berlin Crisis in 1961, and the Vietnam conflict.
Today, the Army Reserve is an integral element of the Army, providing over 30 percent of its tactical support unit requirements and over 25 percent of its general support units. Army Reservists, like the citizen-soldiers of earlier time, stand ready to respond to their country's call and their nation's need. Let us answer their sacrifices and their dedication with our support and gratitude.
I am very proud to congratulate the United States Army Reserve on its Diamond Anniversary.
