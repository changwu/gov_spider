He is the one responsible for energy policies in our country today, and by virtue of his policies we have seen something which he predicted during his campaign. He said with his energy policies energy prices would skyrocket. And frankly, what he has done is made it harder and harder for the small operators, the drillers, to get more oil, more gas, more coal, to develop these American sources of energy." â€” Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney: "Well, I think it's kind of amusing and actually troubling for the President of the United States to be looking for someone to blame. There are a lot of qualities that you look for in a president; blaming other people is not one of them. He is the President of the United States. He is the one responsible for energy policies in our country today, and by virtue of his policies we have seen something which he predicted during his campaign. He said with his energy policies energy prices would skyrocket. And frankly, what he has done is made it harder and harder for the small operators, the drillers, to get more oil, more gas, more coal, to develop these American sources of energy. He is responsible in part for what we're seeing happen around the world, which is people convinced that prices of oil are going to go up."
