    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Vento (D) MN and 113 others)
The Administration supports reauthorization of programs to assist the homeless authorized by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. For FY 1991, the Administration has requested $784.5 million for the McKinney Act programs.
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3789, but will work later in the legislative process to:

—  Delete the new authority for loans to families for security deposits. This program is not designed to assist the homeless who are most in need, since the most needy would not have income sufficient to repay the loan.
—  Delete authority for grants for construction of housing combined with supportive services. Existing facilities can be modified or rehabilitated to serve the homeless without costly new construction.
—  Delete authority for emergency shelter grants that do not require State or local matching shares. These grants should be subject to a match consistent with current law.
—  Delete the new authority for demonstration grants to State and local educational agencies for support services for homeless youth. These activities can be accomplished under the current exemplary grant program in section 723 of the McKinney Act.
—  Delete the provision in current law requiring states to provide data on the number and location of homeless children. The data provided are not reliable.
—  Delete the special authority for the homeless to participate in the Job Corps program. Homeless individuals are already eligible and participating in the program.
