    I HAVE your request for a statement that may be presented at the meeting this evening in New York.
I am glad of the opportunity to express my profound sympathy with those who have been bereaved and who have suffered through these disturbances. Good citizens in every country deplore these outbreaks and this loss of life. Our Government is deeply concerned not only in this broader sense but in the narrower sense of the protection of the lives of American citizens.
Our advices are that the vigorous action taken by the British Government has restored a large measure of protection, although that Government is still faced with great burdens from this outbreak of fanaticism. I know the whole world acknowledges the fine spirit shown by the British Government in accepting the mandate of the Palestine in order that there might under this protection be established a homeland so [p.273] long desired by the Jews. Great progress has been made in this inspiring enterprise over these last ten years, and to this progress the American Jews have made enormous contribution. They have demonstrated not only the fine sentiment and ideals which inspire their activities but its practical possibilities.
I am confident out of these tragic events will come greater security and greater safeguards for the future, under which the steady rehabilitation of the Palestine as a true homeland will be even more assured. An immediate and pressing question is the relief to those who are suffering. The fine sympathy of the American people is already evidencing itself in this purpose and it should receive the most generous support.
