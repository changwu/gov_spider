    Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum made the following statement in reaction to the House of Representatives passage of legislation to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline and exploration in ANWR and off-shore.
Rick Santorum said: "I congratulate the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives for their responsible vote for energy independence in the face of the Obama Administration inexplicable opposition. We saw leadership today by a group of people unwilling to allow environmental extremists to set our energy policy. We need reliable sources of domestic energy to fuel our economy and reinvigorate our manufacturing sector, but not just that - this vote was about American jobs and America's national security. Today's vote is a step in that direction. While it is clear that Harry Reid and Barack Obama will stand in the way of this common-sense legislation, as president I will work with House Republicans and reasonable Democrats to sign similar legislation into law so we can lower energy costs and make real steps toward energy independence."
