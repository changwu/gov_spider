    America's middle class, and working families, have become the invisible Americans.
If you are a hard working single parent who can't afford health insurance or a small business owner who worries about energy costs or a student who can't afford to continue college, you are invisible to this Administration. You are invisible to the oil companies earning record profits while you pay more at the pump. You are invisible to the companies who outsource your job, or lay you off or end the promise of your pension. For six long years, President Bush and the Washington Republicans have looked right through you.
If you are a first responder, worker or volunteer from 9/11 in need of medical treatment, you are invisible to them.
If you are a soldier returning from combat and waiting for treatment or disability pay, you are invisible.
If you are a child sitting in a failing school waiting for the promised federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act, you are invisible.
If you are single mom who needs safe quality child care while you go to work, you are invisible.
And if you're a career government scientist raising the global warming alarm; a conservationist trying to protect the environment; a government accountant looking into no bid contracts that have cost the tax payers billions of dollars; even a Republican U.S. Attorney trying to enforce the law impartially - they've tried to make you invisible to the rest of us.
More than 46 million people living without health insurance. More than 90,000 people living in trailers after Hurricane Katrina. 13 million children living in poverty.
For six long years, they have all been invisible.
Well, they're not invisible to us. They're not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, they will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States.
