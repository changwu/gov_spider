    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today, U.S. Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for President of the United States. Babin is part of the new class of conservatives recently elected to Congress and has vigorously promoted policies that empower people and not the federal government.
"Senator Ted Cruz is a proven and principled conservative leader who has fought tirelessly to defend our liberties and freedoms during his service to Texas and the United States of America," said Babin. "In his time in the U.S. Senate, Ted has shown the conservative leadership and fortitude we so desperately need in our nation's highest office. Now is a time for truth and he will speak honestly to the American people. Ted has my full support in his campaign for the White House."
Prior to being elected to Congress, Babin served as an airborne artilleryman in the U.S. Army Reserve and in the Texas Army National Guard and as an Officer in the United States Air Force. He put himself through school, attending Lamar University and completing dental school at the University of Texas Dental Branch in Houston and has run a dental practice in Southeast, Texas for the last 35 years.
In Congress, Babin is a strong voice for conservative principles and has stood and fought on repealing Obamacare, opposing Obama's unconstitutional amnesty, and balancing the budget.
