    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Stearns (R) FL and 43 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3980, which would extend through December 31, 2001, the special authority for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat Persian Gulf War veterans' illnesses. The bill also would authorize VA to provide priority health care to treat illnesses that may be attributable to a veteran's combat service during any period of war since the Vietnam War or during any future hostilities. In addition, the bill would establish within VA a National Center for the Study of War-Related Illnesses and require VA to enter into agreements with the National Academy of Sciences to investigate the effectiveness of treatments and research related to Persian Gulf War veterans' illnesses.
