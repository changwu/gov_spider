    President Donald J. Trump has delivered more for the American people in 47 months than Joe Biden has in 47 years. From historic trade deals, to unprecedented tax cuts, to record-breaking economic growth, President Trump has continuously put America first and fulfilled his promises to the American people.

Today, President Trump reached 1,000 promises kept to the American people and will continue delivering groundbreaking success when reelected in November.
