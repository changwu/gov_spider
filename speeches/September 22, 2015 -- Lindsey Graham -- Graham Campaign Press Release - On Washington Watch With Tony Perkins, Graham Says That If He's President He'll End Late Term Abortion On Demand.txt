    Alexandria, VA - Senator Lindsey Graham joined Tony Perkins onWashington Watch yesterday where he discussed his unwavering support to end late-term abortion on demand, the science behind an unborn child being able to feel pain at this stage in the womb and why, as president, he would remove the United States from the club of only seven other countries that allow abortions after 20 weeks.
As highlighted in The Hill, Senator Graham is leading the fight for the unborn who can feel pain at this stage in the womb and is the author of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection legislation. He stated yesterday,"We're one of seven nations in the entire world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks, the fifth month of the pregnancy. I'd like to get us out of that club."
