  A Proclamation

Whereas the future peace of the world, so earnestly sought by all, will be immeasurably advanced by the cooperation of the several nations in removing excessive restrictions upon international trade, and the United States has already assumed the lead in the reduction of barriers to world commerce; and
Whereas international trade and travel, utilizing merchant shipping on all the oceans of the globe, will serve as a vehicle of increased participation of the United States in world affairs; and
Whereas the welfare of the American Merchant Marine is of the utmost importance to our national economy, our national defense, and our friendly intercourse with foreign nations; and
Whereas the Congress by Public Resolution 7, 73rd Congress, approved May 20, 1933, took cognizance of the historic fact that "on May 22, 1819, the steamship The Savannah set sail from Savannah, Georgia, on the first successful transoceanic voyage under steam propulsion, thus making a material contribution to the advancement of ocean transportation", and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually calling for the observance of May 22 as National Maritime Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe May 22, 1947, as National Maritime Day by displaying the flag at their homes or other suitable places, and I direct that the flag be displayed on that day on all Government buildings. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 11th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
