    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Roy Lichtenstein. He will long be remembered as a defining force in the pop art movement.
We grew to love his trademark Benday dots and striking primary colors, which distinguished his unique art form and altered the landscape of American art. He had a talent for presenting everyday cultural symbols in ways that attracted our attention and gave these images a new meaning. Two years ago, I had the honor of presenting to Roy the National Medal of Arts Award in recognition of his contribution to American art. In addition, he was especially valued and treasured by us here in the White House because of his generous support for our Arts in Embassies program.
Hillary and I will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family in this sad time.
