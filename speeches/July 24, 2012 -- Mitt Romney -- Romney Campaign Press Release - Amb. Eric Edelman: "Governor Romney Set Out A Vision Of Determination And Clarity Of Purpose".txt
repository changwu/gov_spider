    Former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW:
"Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW convention was Reaganesque. In contrast to Barack Obama's policies of vacillation and hesitation, Governor Romney set out a vision of determination and clarity of purpose. In place of Barack Obama's apologies for America, Governor Romney set out principles and goals founded on our country's enduring tradition of peace through strength. Our friends around the world who are looking for American leadership will be heartened by Romney's plan for another American Century. The suggestion by Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the White House was behind recent leaks of highly classified secrets, highlights the urgent need for change."
