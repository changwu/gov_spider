Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the members of his Advisory Committee on the Constitution and the Courts. A collection of distinguished legal professionals, scholars and business leaders, the Advisory Committee will counsel Governor Romney on judicial matters, the separation of powers and federalism issues.
"Today, too many of our country's most important issues are being decided by unelected judges. We need men and women who will adhere to the Constitution and the rule of law. Our nation simply cannot afford judges who legislate from the bench, and who are willing to depart from the Constitution to advance a narrow agenda. When we have judges of the intellectual capabilities of Roberts, Alito, Scalia and Thomas who have a demonstrated commitment to following the law and the Constitution, we can preserve our democracy where the American people are guiding our nation," said Governor Romney. "I am proud to have the support of these distinguished men and women whose many years of experience will be invaluable to our campaign. It is an honor to have their counsel as we address the most important constitutional issues confronting our nation."
With today's announcement, Professor Mary Ann Glendon and Professor Douglas W. Kmiec, Co-Chairs of the Advisory Committee, issued a joint statement saying, "Governor Romney knows first-hand the importance of nominating judges who will adhere to the rule of law and the Constitution. From our association with him, we know that a President Romney will nominate only men and women who have a genuine appreciation for the Constitution's text, structure and history. Over the course of this campaign, we look forward to working with this group to provide Governor Romney with excellent counsel on the constitutional questions confronting our Judiciary today."
