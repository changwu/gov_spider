  A Proclamation

The history of American agriculture is an inspiring story of progress and sacrifice, high technology and individual effort, and frustration and success. It reflects the growth of our country from an untamed wilderness to the highly productive nation and world leader it is today.
Despite flood, frost, heat, hail, drought, and disease, Americans enjoy an abundance of diverse and high quality products. Our 2.4 million farms are the foundation for a trillion-dollar agricultural industry which employs 19 million farm people and which is the primary source of food and fiber for a third of a billion of the world's population. Each American farm worker produces enough food and fiber to support nearly 80 peopleâ€”a production achievement unmatched anywhere in the world and unparalleled in history.
The courage, tenacity, and know-how of the American farmer make it possible for our citizens to spend a smaller share of their income on food than do people living in any other country.
To honor those who sustain our agricultural prowess and to achieve a greater understanding of each American's dependence upon a reliable food and fiber supply, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 235, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim March 21, 1983, as "National Agriculture Day."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 21, 1983, as "National Agriculture Day" and call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
