Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney named the 28 members of the Romney for President Tennessee Statewide Finance Committee. The Committee will help Governor Romney build upon his base of support in Tennessee and raise the resources necessary to campaign across the nation.
"I am grateful for the support of these dedicated Volunteer State leaders," said Governor Romney. "They recognize, as I do, that America faces a new generation of challenges that we will only overcome through innovation, transformation and a rededication to the conservative values that have made us strong."
"I am pleased to support Governor Romney's efforts in Tennessee," said Committee Chairman Bill Hagerty. "His conservative drive toward a stronger military, stronger economy and stronger families is what America needs in our next president. His experience as a global CEO, as head of the enormously successful Salt Lake Olympics and as a Governor underscore his unique leadership capabilities. Governor Romney is the best choice for Republicans to defeat a Democrat in November 2008."
