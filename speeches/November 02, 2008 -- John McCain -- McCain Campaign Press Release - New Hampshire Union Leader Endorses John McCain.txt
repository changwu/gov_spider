This presidential election comes down, as they often do, to trust. We must trust the person's competence, courage and ability to defend us from our enemies and to fight for the best economic conditions possible.
In both areas, John McCain stands head and shoulders above his rival. McCain has been tested as few men ever have, and he has never been found wanting. Barack Obama has no experience -- none. He may be the most unprepared major-party candidate ever. His own vice presidential pick says our enemies will test him quickly and severely. There is no good reason to take that chance.
Those who believe Obama's claims that he will reduce 95 percent of Americans' taxes, while he pays for near-universal health care, subsidizes clean energy, expands our military commitment in Afghanistan, adds to mass transit and highway infrastructure, etc., etc., are living in a dream world.
Fortunately, there seem to be fewer and fewer dreamers every day, as the polls tighten and people begin to really look at all the promises Obama has made.
John McCain promises us only his hard work and integrity, his experience and true grit, and a solid faith and optimism in America. In our view, that makes him the clear choice for the independent, thoughtful people of New Hampshire.
