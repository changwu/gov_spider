Here's what the campaign had planned for Marco's first event after the South Carolina primary: a rally with 1,000 or so voters at a hotel in Franklin, TN, with a bunch of local conservatives who've backed Marco and Lee Greenwood providing some musical entertainment.
Here's what we got instead: a rally with Lee Greenwood and local conservative leaders, just . . . outside in the hotel parking lot because nearly 5,000 voters showed up.

What does the huge crowd tell you? Marco has the momentum in places like Tennessee, which votes March 1st.
I usually don't buy into crowd size as mark of momentum, but this Nashville crowd is biggest for Marco Rubio I've ever seen.

Remember this great video set to "God Bless the USA," from before the Iowa caucuses?
