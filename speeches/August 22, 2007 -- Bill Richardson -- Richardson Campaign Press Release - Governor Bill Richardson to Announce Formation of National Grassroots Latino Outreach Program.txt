    SANTA FE, NM -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson will announce the creation of a new grassroots Latino outreach program at a press conference on Thursday, August 23rd at 12 noon Pacific Time in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The program, which originated in Las Vegas, Nevada, will be the first grassroots Latino outreach effort unveiled by a 2008 presidential candidate. It is a quintessential example of grassroots politics, with the aim to involve a large number of families in the political process. Latinos currently comprise around 14% of the US population, making them the largest ethnic minority group in our country. Governor Richardson, as a Latino himself, is well aware of the Latino community's increasing importance in American society.
Governor Richardson is unmatched in the field of presidential candidates on the issues that matter most to all Americans, including Latinos. On the Iraq war, Richardson is the only candidate who advocates pulling all our troops out as soon as possible, leaving no residual forces behind. On immigration, Richardson is in favor of comprehensive and humane reform. By creating a path to legalization that requires illegal immigrants to pay back taxes and learn English, Richardson's plan does not grant amnesty and helps keep families together.
