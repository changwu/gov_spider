    ARLINGTON, VA - U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released the following statement from campaign spokesman Brian Rogers on faith based initiatives:
"John McCain supports faith based initiatives, and recognizes their important role in our communities. He has co-sponsored legislation to foster improved partnerships with community organizations, including faith-based organizations, to assist with substance abuse and violence prevention. He also believes that it is important for faith-based groups to be able to hire people who share their faith, and he disagrees with Senator Obama that hiring at faith-based groups should be subject to government oversight."
