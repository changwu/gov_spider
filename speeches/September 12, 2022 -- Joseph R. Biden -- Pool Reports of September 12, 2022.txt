Travel pool report 11 - Biden infra remarks end
POTUS spoke of the dignity of work. Reminisced about the late Sen. Teddy Kennedy, who campaigned for Biden when he ran for Senate the first time. Quotes Kennedy: "I like Joe Biden a lot.. problem is, I think he's a little too young." POTUS chuckles that the WSJ went with the "too young" line.
Logan "needs an upgrade in support of international trade." Terminal E services international flights. Today, 4 times as many passengers come thru this terminal as when it first opened 50 years ago. ... This project will create 5,900 jobs, he says.
"We'll have a first-class airport here in very short order." Today, not a single US airport ranks in the top 25 in the world, he says. "What in the hell is the matter with us?"
"Folks in China think we're a spent economy". Now, US is investing $25 billion to modify airports.
Previews remarks on cancer moonshot, how we need to "think big." "Folks, we've got to remember who we are ... this is the United States of America"

"Today I'm setting a long-term goal for a cancer moonshot to rally American ingenuity, just as we did to reach the moon."

After introduction from the host, Potus began to speak at 6:35p.
Host is Jonathan Lavine, wife is Jeannie.
Biden: "Folks, I am optimistic"
Quotes from Otter transcript (there will be an official transcript later):
"I genuinely am more optimistic about the prospects for America. not because I'm President, because of the nature of where we are as a country"
"I really think that inflection points are times when you're going to look back, as I said, 10 years from now and say, they either did it or they didn't do it. they have changed direction for the country and improved it, or they lost the opportunity. And when I talk about democracy, it's not just in the United States around the world. The good news and bad news is around so darn long, I know every one of these heads of state, and I've known as well."
Talks about decision to run - after Charlottesville. Was still reluctant to run, because he knew how ugly it would be.
Talks about the family meeting he had 4 years ago on his decision to run.
"And here's the deal. You know, we're now in a situation where less than 60 days from the midterms…
"It's about the right to choose the right to privacy. It's about weather so security revealed to be faithful or whether or not it's going to be something every year that comes up on the ballot and has to be voted on again. That's the Republican platform so far in writing. It's about the safety of kids in school violence instead of dealing with reading and writing rip and take learn how to duck and cover It's about the survival of the planet. literally not figuratively, in terms of environment. it's about the right to vote, and truly like democracy itself. And I don't think that's hyperbole. It's about democracy itself."
Talks about American Rescue Plan -"that's what kept things moving". Then talks infrastructure plan.
"I mean, there's just a range of things we can do. We used to invest over 2% of our GDP on research and development. We don't we invest less than seven tenths of 1%. Now the rest of the world is moving. You know we the chips and science law. You know, the reason why inflation was so high last year was the cost of automobiles. why? because there weren't the country or chips to build."
"The price of gas is down a dollar 30 a gallon and has gone down every single month since the beginning of the year."
"I want to codify Roe v Wade. If we lose this off year election, you're going to have an effort to codify the Supreme Court decision. Eliminate roe totally state issue now if they do that, as long as I'm President, I will detail that I want to codify that's a gigantic issue. And Mark my words you're gonna see move on other privacy issues from contraceptions to married a whole range of things. In addition to that Republicans did put out a plan And and I read a copy I forgot to put here but look it up online. Rick Scott, the senator from Florida who heads up the Senate campaign committee, He wants to sunset social security medicare every single year."
"We need to control the House and the Senate to win the race up and down the ticket. ….vast majority of voters aren't MAGA republicans."
"if we lose the house or lose the Senate, is going to be a really difficult two years. I'll be spending more time in the veto, being able to get anything done."
"And the other reason why I'm optimistic and with this, is that, you know, if you take a look at the younger generation, the 18 to 30 year Olds the most open is the least prejudice is the most forward regeneration of volunteers."
"This generation coming up, is the single most engaged generation"
Pool ushered out at 6:57 pm. Potus stayed to take questions. Pool now holding on sidewalk near vans in unseasonably balmy weather.
