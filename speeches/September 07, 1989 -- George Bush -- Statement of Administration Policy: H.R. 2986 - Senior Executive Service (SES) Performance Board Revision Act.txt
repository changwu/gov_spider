    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sikorski (D) MN and Morelia (R) MD)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2986 because it is unnecessary. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has administrative authority to provide that SES Performance Review Boards be composed of a majority of career members of the SES, which is the purpose of H.R. 2986. On August 29, 1989, OPM published proposed regulations in the Federal Register that would accomplish the purpose of H.R. 2986.
