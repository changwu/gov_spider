    On day four of his "America Rising" tour, Edwards says corporate greed hurts everyone and Democrats, Republicans and Independents will work to wrestle power back to the middle class
Boone, Iowa â€“ Today at a community meeting in Boone, Iowa, Senator John Edwards said that Democrats, Republicans and Independents must work together to fight the corporate greed that is destroying the middle class. Edwards' remarks calling on politicians to work across party lines to fix the broken system in Washington come on day four of his "America Rising: Fighting for the Middle Class" bus tour across Iowa. During the final days leading up to the caucuses, Edwards is visiting 38 counties and meeting with thousands of caucus goers to share with them his plans to stand up to powerful interests and make sure hard-working middle class families can get ahead.
"To get real change, we need a president who will stand up against the big corporations and powerful interests who control Washington," Edwards said today at his "Countdown to Caucus" event in Boone. "We need somebody who is going to fight this fight and win this fight. But I'm not talking about going to Washington as president and fighting politicians.
"I want to be absolutely clear that the corporate greed that is destroying the middle class of this country and stealing your children's future, it is stealing the future of Democrats' children, Independents' children, Republicans' children, " Edwards continued. "I'm telling you, this is a message and a cause we can unite America around."
Edwards comes from a working class family and has spent his life standing up to powerful interests and fighting for regular Americans like the ones he grew up with. As president, he will continue to stand up to these interests and bring change to America. He believes every time we fight for jobs, families, the middle class, universal health care, and an end to poverty, America rises.
