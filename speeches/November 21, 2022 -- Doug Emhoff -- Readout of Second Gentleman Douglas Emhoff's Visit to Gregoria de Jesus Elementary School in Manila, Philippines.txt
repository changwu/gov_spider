    Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff visited Gregoria de Jesus Elementary School in Manila, Philippines following the reopening of schools after more than two years of closures due to COVID-19.Â During his visit, the Second Gentleman announced $5 million in additional COVID-19 funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to accelerate vaccine rollout in the Philippines. This assistance, funded through the American Rescue Plan, will support vaccine distribution for children and adults. The Second Gentleman also announced that the United States would be providing hygiene kits and other COVID-19 supplies to further boost the country's efforts against the disease. Mr. Emhoff was joined by Department of Health Officer in Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire and Caloocan Mayor Dale Gonzalo Malapitan. He also met with students, educators, and school administrators to learn about the school's health practices. Since the beginning of COVID-19, the U.S. government has provided nearly $50 million in COVID response assistance to the Philippines and donated more than 33 million COVID-19 doses in coordination with COVAX. The Second Gentleman reaffirmed the United States commitment to working with the Philippine government to fight against COVID-19.
