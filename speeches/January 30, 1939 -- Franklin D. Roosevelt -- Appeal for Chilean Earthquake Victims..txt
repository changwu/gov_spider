    The effects of the catastrophe which has overtaken the people of Chile become hourly more serious. The need for hospital supplies, food and clothing is imperative. Perhaps greater than all else is the need for prompt and practical help that may further strengthen the magnificent morale shown by a people afflicted by an appalling calamity.
It is desirable not only to make the best effort we can to help our friends and neighbors who are in distress, but to make this effort in the most effective way. Therefore I urge all those individuals, institutions and organizations whose sympathies are aroused by the grief and suffering of thousands of individuals in Chile to coordinate their efforts and to make their contributions through the American Red Cross which, from the outset of this disaster, has been giving assistance through its sister society, the Chilean Red Cross.
Some days ago I instructed the United States Army and Navy to cooperate in every practical way. Since medicines and other hospital supplies are of paramount importance, I am glad to say that United States Army planes have already landed in Chile with emergency medical supplies. This cooperation on the part of this Government will be continued.
In accordance with their traditional practice, the American people will surely wish to give such assistance as they can to peoples of other lands who are in distress, particularly when, as in the present case, those suffering from disaster are the nationals of an American republic bound to the people of the United States by close ties of understanding and of friendship. The Chilean disaster is of such tragic proportions as to merit the most prompt and generous response from the American public.
