    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Johnson (D) South Dakota)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 5204. If H.R. 5204 is presented to the President in its current form, the Secretary of the Interior will recommend that he veto the bill.
H.R. 5204 duplicates existing program authorities, is inconsistent with Federal credit policies involving direct and guaranteed loan subsidies, and would require the Department of the Interior to assume additional costs related to technical assistance grants that should be borne by the project -participants.
