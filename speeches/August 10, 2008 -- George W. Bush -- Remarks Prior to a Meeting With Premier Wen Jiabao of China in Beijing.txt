    Premier Wen. Mr. President, welcome to Beijing. I also welcome your family members and other friends from the United States to the Beijing Olympic Games.
I already learned that yesterday you went to see the American athletes in Beijing and you also watched a match played by the U.S. women's basketball team.
President Bush. Right.
Premier Wen. You also spent some time with the beach volleyball players. [Laughter]
I think this evening the match between the Chinese men's basketball team and the American men's basketball team will captivate the attention of people from all over the world.
President Bush. That's right.
Premier Wen. I'm very happy that you're going to watch the match.
President Bush. Yes, sir. I'm going with the Foreign Minister. [Laughter] He's going—he told me he's going to be yelling at the top of his lungs. [Laughter]
Thank you for your hospitality. It's been a wonderful experience being here. I didn't see if you were at the opening ceremonies.
Premier Wen. Yes, I was there.
President Bush. Well, it was fantastic— really well done. But thank you.
Premier Wen. Yes, the opening ceremony is spectacular.
President Bush. Unbelievable.
Premier Wen. When the U.S. team marched into the stadium, I saw that you put back your coat and your suit and then you stood up and cheered for your team.
President Bush. Yes, sir. I was proud to see them. But I bet you did the same thing when the Chinese team came. [Laughter]
Premier Wen. Yes, yes. I did the same.
