    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On April 18, 1977, I addressed the American people to impress upon them the gravity of our national energy situation. On April 20, 1977, before a Joint Session of the Congress, I outlined a series of recommendations for dealing with our energy problem.
Today, I am transmitting to the Congress the proposed National Energy Act, which includes the legislative measures needed to implement the National Energy Plan. I am also releasing a comprehensive National Energy Plan which describes in detail the nature of our current and future energy problems, the hard facts which our national energy policy must address, and my proposals for dealing with these realities.
I recognize that the measures proposed will impose burdens on all Americans, and that many of these measures will be highly controversial. There is no doubt in my mind that during the next several months these proposals will receive intense scrutiny and attention from the Congress. I want to assure you that I and members of my Administration will work closely with the Congress toward the prompt enactment of the National Energy Act so that we can together solve the energy problems facing our country.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
