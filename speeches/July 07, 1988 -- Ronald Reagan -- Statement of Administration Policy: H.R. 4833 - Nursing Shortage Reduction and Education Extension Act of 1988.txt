    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Wyden (D) OR and others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4833 because the existing antiquated categorical approach to support nurse training would be continued at a time when a more flexible approach, as proposed in the Presidents FY 1989 Budget, is needed. Moreover, the authorization levels contained in H.R. 4833 are far in excess of the amounts proposed in the President's FY 1989 Budget.
The Administration's proposed Cooperative Health Professions Initiatives authority would permit the Federal Government to best utilize funds to accomplish national priority health personnel objectives under a flexible authority that allows adaptation to changing needs, both over time and among different programs in any given year.
