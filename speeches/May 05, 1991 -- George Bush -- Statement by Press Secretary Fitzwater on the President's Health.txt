    The President spent a comfortable night, sleeping well. He awoke at 6 a.m., did paperwork, and spoke with Governor Sununu by phone.
The President is in great spirits, but still has atrial fibrillation. There are no signs of heart damage and no evidence of a heart attack. The President has no other symptoms and feels completely normal. This is corroborated by the blood and x-ray tests which were examined this morning.
The President continues to take digoxin for the atrial fibrillation. This is now being supplemented by the drug procainamide, which is a normal procedure in such cases. The President will remain at the naval hospital today for observation on the drugs.
