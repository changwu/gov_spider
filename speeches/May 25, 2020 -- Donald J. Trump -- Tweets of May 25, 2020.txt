Sleepy Joe's representatives have just put out an ad saying that I went to play golf (exercise) today. They think I should stay in the White House at all times. What they didn't say is that it's the first time I've played golf in almost 3 months, that Biden was constantly.....Retweets: 25226Favorites: 112791

...vacationing, relaxing & making shady deals with other countries, & that Barack was always playing golf, doing much of his traveling in a fume spewing 747 to play golf in Hawaii - Once even teeing off immediately after announcing the gruesome death of a great young man by ISIS!Retweets: 19541Favorites: 81897

I give, and have given from the beginning, my entire yearly salary, $400,000 to $450,000, back to our government. Last check to HHS Covid relief. My great honor! https://t.co/Vv6Uyz9MkFRetweets: 30221Favorites: 117215

I love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August. Unfortunately, Democrat Governor, @RoyCooperNC is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed...Retweets: 16719Favorites: 68036

Some stories about the fact that in order to get outside and perhaps, even a little exercise, I played golf over the weekend. The Fake & Totally Corrupt News makes it sound like a mortal sin - I knew this would happen! What they don't say is that it was my first golf in almost...Retweets: 27477Favorites: 129504

They don't mention Sleepy Joe's poor work ethic, or all of the time Obama spent on the golf course, often flying to....Retweets: 16751Favorites: 83063

....Hawaii in a big, fully loaded 747, to play. What did that do to the so-called Carbon Footprint? He also played moments after the brutal killing by ISIS of a wonderful young man. Totally inappropriate - and it was me who shattered 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. I was left a MESS!Retweets: 17810Favorites: 83921

I have zero interest in moving the Republican National Convention to Doral in Miami, as falsely reported by the Fake News @nytimes in order to stir up trouble. Ballroom is not nearly big enough & would like to stay in N.C., whose gov. doesn't even know if he can let people in? https://t.co/nqBBPv4VXSRetweets: 16178Favorites: 57313

Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Connor Lamm has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi. He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL & COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement! https://t.co/v1OnY0MI8mRetweets: 15650Favorites: 52467

Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps.) went crazy when I banned, in late January, people coming in from China. He called me "xenophobic" & then went equally "nuts" when we let in 44,000 people - until he was told they were American citizens coming home. He later apologized!Retweets: 24932Favorites: 105712

Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19, sometimes referred to as the China Virus. Ventilators, Testing, Medical Supply Distribution, we made a lot of Governors look very good - And got no credit for so doing. Most importantly, we helped a lot of great people!Retweets: 30722Favorites: 163973
