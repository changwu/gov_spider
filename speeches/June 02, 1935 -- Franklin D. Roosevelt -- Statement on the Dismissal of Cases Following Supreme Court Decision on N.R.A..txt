    The Attorney General has recommended and the President has approved the dismissal of four hundred and eleven cases as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in the Schechter case. All of these cases related to the enforcement of code or similar requirements relating to violations of fair trade practices on the part of individual businesses or to failure to live up to minimum wage or hour standards.
Had it not been for the grounds stated by the Supreme Court in the Schechter case findings, these cases would have been pressed by the Government in order to obtain effective enforcement of the wage standards and fair trade practices set up as the intention of the National Recovery Act.
There are, of course, a large number of additional cases in every State in which actual court action has not yet been initiated. These also, because of the Schechter case decision, must necessarily be dropped.
