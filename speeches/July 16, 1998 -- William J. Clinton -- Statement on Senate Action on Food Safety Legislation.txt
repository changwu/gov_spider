    I welcome today's 66-33 vote to restore much needed funds to our food safety programs. Food safety should not be about politics; instead it must be about protecting our families and children. Today, the Senate put Americans first and partisanship last. With this money we will be able to improve safety inspections of foods, better educate the public on how to handle food safely, improve research, and aid the effort to track food borne outbreaks such as salmonella and E. coli. We must continue to work together in the coming months on this issue and on the many other issues which the American people care about. The American people want action, not political wrangling.
