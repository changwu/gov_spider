    For 12 years in the United States House of Representatives, Joe Kennedy has proven himself to be a dedicated advocate for the Nation's working families. His efforts on behalf of his Massachusetts constituents, as well as underprivileged people across America, will be sorely missed in Washington. As one of the foremost voices in the Congress for low income housing opportunities for needy families, Representative Kennedy worked to expand the availability of credit to working Americans to buy homes and to open businesses.
I know that Representative Kennedy will continue his family's long tradition of public service on behalf of our Nation. I wish him well in all of his future endeavors, and on behalf of the Nation I thank him for his dedicated service.
