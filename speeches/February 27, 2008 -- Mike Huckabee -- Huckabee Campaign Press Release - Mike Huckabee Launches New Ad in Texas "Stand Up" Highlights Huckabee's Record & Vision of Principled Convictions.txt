    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee launched a new 30-second television ad in Texas to air through the March 4, 2008 Republican Primary.
"Stand Up" highlights Huckabee's principled conservative convictions and the American belief in "standing for something so you don't fall for anything."
Huckabee, who received a major endorsement from Dallas Cowboys' football legend Cliff Harris, will return to the Lone Star State tomorrow for campaign events. The 30-second spot will complement his campaign visits, reaching 100% rotation in the Dallas and Houston markets.
"All across America , my authentic conservative message of faith, family, and freedom has resonated – not because I am the candidate of the establishment, but because I am the candidate who stands for principles, not politics; convictions, not convenience; and Main Street, not K Street" Huckabee said.
"This ad highlights Texans history of standing up for what is right regardless of what others may think, say, or do. I hope voters all across Texas will continue to affirm their core conservative values, because on March 4th, it's time to stand up and be counted," said Huckabee. "There have been many flags over Texas , and not a single one of them was the white flag of surrender."
