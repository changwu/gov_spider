    Today, former United States Senator Bob Dole announces his role as National Veterans' Chairman for the presidential campaign of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, citing his forward-looking vision for the country and dedication to the men and women of our military.
"I consider nearly all of the Republican candidates to be my friends, but I have determined that Jeb Bush is the most qualified. Jeb has the proven leadership skills and executive experience needed to fix the problems facing our country â€” from the anemic economy to America's weakened standing among world leaders. Jeb's conservative reform agenda and forward looking vision on issues including 4 percent economic growth, defeating ISIS and taking care of our veterans are in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton's strategy to continue the failed policies of the present Administration," said former United States Senator Bob Dole. "I will do all I can to be helpful to Jeb's campaign."
"I am honored to have Senator Bob Dole's support and I am thankful for his service to our country and our veterans. The policies of the Obama administration have left the Veterans Administration in an utter mess and one of my first priorities as President will be to fix this broken system and give our veterans the care they deserve. I'm thankful for Senator Dole's valued advice," former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush.
Bob Dole is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1961-69) and U.S. Senate (1969-96) from Kansas. In 1996, he was the Republican Party's nominee for the presidency.
Bob Dole and President George H.W. Bush have had a strong relationship over the years, having both served our country in WWII. In 2007, Bob Dole was appointed Co-Chair of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. Senator Dole is currently special counsel at the law firm of Alston & Bird and serves as Finance Chair of the Campaign for the National Eisenhower Memorial.
