    Today's action by the House on the "Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003" is an important step toward implementing the kind of active forest management that is good for both the environment and our economy. It will save lives and the national treasure of our great forests, with their wildlife, trees, waters, habitat, and other natural resources.
I urge the Senate to act quickly on this much-needed legislation. As this year's fire season progresses, we must equip Federal land managers with the tools they need to protect lives and communities, restore forest health, and safeguard habitat and watersheds.
