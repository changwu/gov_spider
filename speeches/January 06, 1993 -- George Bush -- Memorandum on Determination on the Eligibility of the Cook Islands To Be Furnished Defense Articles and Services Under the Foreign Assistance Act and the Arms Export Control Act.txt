Justification for Presidential Determination of Eligibility of Cook Islands To Be Furnished Defense Articles and Services Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act
Section 503 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Section 3(a)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act (the Act) require, as a condition of eligibility to acquire defense articles and services from the United States, that the President find that the furnishings of such articles to and services to the country concerned will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.
The Cook Islands occupies a strategic geographic position in the South Pacific. It is a parliamentary democracy, and pursues a friendly, pro-Western foreign policy. There have been regular national elections since independence in 1965. It has a market economy, in which fishing plays a major role.
The Cook Islands recently established a maritime guard. This service will help the country monitor fishing activities in its waters and undertake surveillance in support of national immigration, customs and quarantine laws. Secondary functions will be disaster relief, search and rescue, medical evacuation, and environmental pollution control. This improved capability will enable the Cook Islands to better control its resources and thus will contribute to its development. We anticipate that the Cook Islands will look to the United States and other friendly countries as potential sources for the procurement of defense articles and services to sustain that capability.
Providing defense articles and services to the Cook Islands will further our long-term goals of promoting democracy, stability, and economic development in the Cook Islands, and will thereby strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.
