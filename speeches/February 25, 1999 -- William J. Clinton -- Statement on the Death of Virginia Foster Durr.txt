    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Virginia Foster Durr. Throughout this century, America's long march toward freedom and justice has been the achievement of countless Americans—black and white—who risked their lives to lead us closer to our most cherished ideals. A white woman born to privilege in the Deep South, Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye to racism and intolerance in our society. Her courage, outspokenness, and steely conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped change this Nation forever. Hillary and I feel honored to have known and been inspired by this truly great American. Our thoughts and prayers are with her friends and family.
