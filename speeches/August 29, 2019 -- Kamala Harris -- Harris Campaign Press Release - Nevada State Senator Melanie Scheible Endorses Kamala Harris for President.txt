    "Senator Harris will bring integrity, experience, and courage to the office of the president. I am proud to support her candidacy."
On the heels of Senator Kamala Harris' successful seventh visit to Nevada, State Senator Melanie Scheible is endorsing her for president. Sen. Scheible first got elected to represent her competitive Senate district that encompasses Spring Valley and Summerlin in 2018 as part of the first majority-female state legislature in the country. She brings Harris' Nevada endorsements to 30, including six current elected officials, the most out of any Democratic presidential candidates.
"Kamala Harris has proven her ability to effect change at the highest levels of government as a U.S. senator and California attorney general," said State Senator Melanie Scheible. "She also remembers what it means to be a public servant and put people first. Senator Harris will bring integrity, experience, and courage to the office of the president. I am proud to support her candidacy."
In the Senate, Scheible has been a leading voice in improving the lives of Nevada's children. She introduced bills during the 2019 session to ensure better coverage for children on Medicaid and equitable funding for community clinics. She also has been outspoken in the need to improve our education system, including paying teachers wages that reflect the professionals they are. Senator Harris has introduced a plan to increase teacher pay, which will give the average Nevada teacher a $15,000 raise. This will be the largest investment in teacher pay in the country ever.
