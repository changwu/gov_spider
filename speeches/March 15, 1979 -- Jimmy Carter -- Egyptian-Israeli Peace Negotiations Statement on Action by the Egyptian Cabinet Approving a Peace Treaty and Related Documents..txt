    I am pleased that the Egyptian Cabinet now has approved the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and the related documents. The Cabinet has now given its support to President Sadat's imaginative leadership and decisive action in moving to end more than three decades of conflict with Israel.
We look forward now to formal action on Sunday by the Israeli Cabinet, to be followed by the debate in the Knesset next week.
The Egyptian action today, along with the preliminary action of the Israeli Cabinet yesterday on the outstanding issues, continues the momentum toward a quick conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin continue to demonstrate their leadership and courage in building the cornerstone of peace in the Middle East. We will continue to assist Egypt and Israel to move their countries from war to peace, thereby releasing the resources that can bring a better life for their people.
