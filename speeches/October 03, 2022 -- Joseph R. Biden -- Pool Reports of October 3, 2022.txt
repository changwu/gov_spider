In the afternoon, the President will receive a briefing on Hurricane Fiona. This briefing will have an out-of-town pool spray at the top.
Then, the President will deliver remarks about the Administration's commitment to the people of Puerto Rico and to helping rebuild more secure and resilient infrastructure. These remarks will be open press.
During the visit, the President will announce more than $60 million in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to shore up levees, strengthen flood walls, and create a new flood warning system to help Puerto Rico become better prepared for future storms.
The President and the First Lady also will visit Centro Sor Isolina Ferré Aguayo School to meet with families and community leaders impacted by Hurricane Fiona, participate in a community service project, and thank the Federal and local officials working around the clock to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild.

Travel pool report 4 — arrival at port
The motorcade arrived at the Port of Ponce about 2:30 p.m.
The pool did not see POTUS arrive, and is waiting for a spray at the top of his briefing here before he goes to give remarks on the same grounds.



October 3, 202215:01 AST

Travel pool report 5 — spray/potus briefing
POTUS emerged around 2:40 p.m. in front of two small shipping containers at a lot on the grounds of the port. Two large printouts — maps of the island — were laid out in front of the group. The pool could not make out much of the briefing POTUS received, but they were talking about the recovery stage Puerto Rico is in and there was a request for POTUS to issue some kind of unspecified extension for relief. There also was talk of the grid and the amount of rain, though, again, it was very hard to hear.

Governor Pedro Pierluisi, Governor of Puerto Rico
Administrator Deanne Criswell, Federal Emergency Management Agency

Travel pool report 7 — Biden remarks
Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi opened the program. He told the assembled guests at the Port of Ponce that he's asked President Joe Biden to extend a major disaster declaration for 180 more days to pay for 100% of debris removal, etc. The governor said Biden's visit was not an isolated incident and that it was another example of his administration's commitment to the people of Puerto Rico. He said he wanted the people here to be treated the same way as all Americans; and again thanked Biden for his help and attention.
Biden, in a blue oxford shirt with open collar and khakis, took the stage and joked that he doesn't want the headline to read "Biden brings storm to Puerto Rico," as large, dark clouds hovered over him. Biden said he's long felt an intense kinship with the people here, noting his many visits and the fact that he's from a small and diverse state. Biden said, in a sense, he was raised politically in the Puerto Rican community. "I was sort of raised in the Puerto Rican community at home politically," he said.
Most of his remakes focused on what the administration is doing to help with the recovery.
"We're going to make sure you get every single dollar promised," Biden said, adding that he approved the first set of relief funding before the recent storm hit.
Biden talked about the various other aid, and said many of the FEMA staff on the ground are Puerto Ricans who are helping their neighbors while also caring for their own families. He spoke rapidly, as the clouds hung closer and thunder rolled while lightening struck far in the background. Biden said he is not leaving until the work here — "every single thing" — is done.
He wrapped at 3:30 p.m.
We're rolling to the next stop in a few minutes.

The motorcade drove through Ponce, spotting signs displaying some anti-American hostility — "Biden Go Home," one read. There also were some supporters and others with various signs stating that financial aid was "stolen" from the people here after Maria and they worried it would happen again.
The motorcade stopped at 3:50 p.m. and the pool walked about a block to an indoor basketball court inside a school where groceries and household goods — 10 pound sacks of yellow onions, cuties, garlic, boxed juice, rice, nuts, ground corn, chickpeas, and cases of bottled water — were gathered in white plastic shopping bags and arrayed atop long tables covered in red and blue tablecloths. At least 50 people loaded bags or stood around the room.
At 4 p.m., FLOTUS, in a floral dress, entered the gym and started bagging. She chatted with the First Lady of Puerto Rico, dropped off more goods into more bags.
She's posing for many pictures and still helping out. The pool is waiting for POTUS to enter.

Travel pool report 9 — school gym POTUS
Thunder cracked as the pool milled about the school gym waiting for POTUS. White House staff told us President Joe Biden spent several minutes in the pull-aside with families and other leaders impacted by Fiona (see prior pool note for the list of names).
First lady Jill Biden continued to pose for pictures and fill large white plastic bags with goods. A large Puerto Rican flag hung on one wall and a sign for the Hispanic Federation hung beside it. It is exceptionally hot — like being inside a steam room, and one woman is weaving around the room passing out water. The upper walls of the gym are metal mesh, and one small air conditioning unit doesn't appear to be working. Many of the people who were staffing the event have retired to the bleachers to wait for Biden.
At 4:38 p.m., Biden entered to cheers. He posed to a group photo and then stopped and chatted. He left the room less than two minutes later (he did not load groceries). We are headed back to the vans.
