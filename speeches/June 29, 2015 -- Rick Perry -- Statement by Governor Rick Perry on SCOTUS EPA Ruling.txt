    AUSTIN — Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's ruling in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency:
"The Obama Administration has driven up the cost of goods and services for American families through arbitrary, heavy-handed regulations implemented by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Today's ruling ends the false narrative that environmental protection can only be achieved through one-size-fits-all federal mandates and at the expense of economic growth — a premise that has been debunked in states like Texas, where smart regulations have proven economic opportunity and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive.
We cannot continue to strangle American job creators with overregulation and expect anything other than the stagnant economic recovery of the Obama years. America needs a leader in the White House who will give the states flexibility to implement smart and innovative policies to grow a strong economy and preserve our environment."
