Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Hanukkah:
"Ann and I would like to wish the Jewish community a Happy Hanukkah. The festival of lights is a holiday that represents hope. The story of the Maccabees reminds us all of the value of faith and the promise that tomorrow brings. It is an amazing story of courage; a true tale of fighting for freedom.
"The United States and the American people embody these very values – hope and freedom. It is important that we stop to recognize this meaningful holiday – a celebration of both human bravery and a miracle. Have a Happy Hanukkah."
