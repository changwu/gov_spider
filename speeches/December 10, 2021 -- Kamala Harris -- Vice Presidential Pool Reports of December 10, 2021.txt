VP Supplemental pool report #3
Here are the VP's remarks in response to a question from the supplemental pool:
Q: "The Biden administration promised a whole of government response to SB 8. So after DoJ's lawsuit was defeated what will the Biden administration do next?
A: "Well listen, the ruling today is an attempt to undue -in terms of what's happening in Texas in particular and around the country - 50 years of precedent. And as far as I'm concerned and as far as our administration is concerned, a woman's right to make decisions about her own body is non-negotiable. And so we will continue to fight for the constitutional right of all women to make decisions about their own body without interference by some legislative group of people that think that they can replace their judgment with hers."
