    Diverse Group to Advise Campaign; Mobilize Community for Hillary
Hillary Clinton's Nevada campaign today announced the formation of the Nevada LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) Leadership Council, a group of educators, business leaders, and community activists endorsing Clinton's bid for the presidency. The council will advise the campaign on issues relating to the LGBT community and mobilize support for the January 19th caucus.
"Hillary Clinton has dedicated her life to standing up for those who often lack a voice in our society," said Judy Corbisiero, President of the Southern Nevada Stonewall Democrats. "I've admired her intelligence and compassion since her days as America's First Lady. I am confident that she is the candidate with the strength and experience to stand up for the LGBT community as our next President."
"The Clinton campaign is fortunate to have the support of these dedicated activists and community leaders mobilizing caucus-goers for Hillary in the Silver State," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "The members of this council understand Hillary Clinton's commitment to equality for all Americans."
Senator Clinton has been a longtime friend of gay Americans, fighting for policies that promote equality, while taking a strong stand against forces that have tried to marginalize the LGBT community. As president, she is committed to passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. She will continue to fight against the Federal Marriage Amendment, and this week introduced a comprehensive plan to combat HIV/AIDS. In a new survey released last week by Hunter College, Hillary leads all Democratic candidates in support among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LBG) Americans with 63 percent, 41 points ahead of the next candidate.
