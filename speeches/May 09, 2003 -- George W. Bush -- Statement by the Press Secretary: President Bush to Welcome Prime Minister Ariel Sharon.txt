    President Bush has invited Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to visit him in Washington on May 20, 2003. The United States and Israel have a firm friendship, and the two leaders will discuss efforts to move ahead toward a peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as a range of bilateral and regional issues.
The President very much looks forward to the Prime Minister's visit.
