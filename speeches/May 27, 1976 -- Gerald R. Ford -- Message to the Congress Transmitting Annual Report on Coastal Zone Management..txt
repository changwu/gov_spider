    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the third annual report from the Secretary of Commerce covering the significant developments that took place during the second full year of implementation of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. The period covered is Fiscal Year 1975, when the states began full development of their coastal programs.
The country's urgent need for new domestic sources of energy and our concern for minimizing environmental damage and community disruption have combined to underscore the importance of the effort put forth in the coastal zone program. The program points out the importance of cooperation at the state and federal level in order to provide appropriate and timely solutions to these important problems.
