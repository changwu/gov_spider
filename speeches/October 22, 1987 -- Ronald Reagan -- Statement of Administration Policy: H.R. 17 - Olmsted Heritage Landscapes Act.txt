    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Udall (D) AZ and 21 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 17. The bill is unnecessary, given that the contributions of Frederick Olmsted to landscape architecture are already well commemorated in the National Park System. The Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site in Massachusetts, for example, was established solely for this purpose. Many other efforts are being undertaken under existing authority to inventory and preserve historic Olmsted landscapes. The cumbersome advisory commission and the $2.5 million appropriations authorization contained in H.R. 17, therefore, are neither needed nor warranted.
