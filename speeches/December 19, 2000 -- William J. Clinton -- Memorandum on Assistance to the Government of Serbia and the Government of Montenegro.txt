Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, including section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160), I hereby certify to the Congress that I have determined that the waiver of the application of subsections 1511(b) and (c) of Public Law 103-160 is necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to the parties, to the extent that such provisions apply to the furnishing of assistance to the Government of Serbia and to the support of assistance from international financial institutions to the Government of Serbia and the Government of Montenegro.
