In-town pool report #3 — more from Kudlow
We broke at 10:52
On the meeting with oil execs and "production cuts": "President Trump, talking on a number of occasions with President Putin and MBS of Saudi Arabia, and the President, President Trump believes they have given agreement on their commitments, ending their spats with each other and stop artificially throwing oil on the market which is already vastly oversupplied... as far as the oil meeting today, I don't want to get out in front of that."
On 3M: "I cannot speak to it. I am not familiar with what 3M said.
On unemployment numbers: "I would just say generally, the whole pandemic and its consequences have come on exponentially faster than anyone frankly" expected. "So are they worse? I don't know if they're worse. We've been gearing up for really bad... again I will acknowledge the facts on the ground. Those numbers, and those hardships, are going to get worse before they get better, but that's an acknowledgement. That's why we have to try to do what I do. Again, this is temporary."
On glitches with Phase 3 rollout: "One of the things that PResident Trump has done is involve the private sector in ways that have never been done before in a crisis like this... I think that that has helped it, and I think it was speeded to a positive conclusion. These free enterprise people are very smart, and I know they're gonna be glitches, I get that. But they're real smart and they're helping us enormously."
