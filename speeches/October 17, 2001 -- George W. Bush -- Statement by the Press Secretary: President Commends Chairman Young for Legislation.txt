    The President commends Chairman Young for introducing comprehensive legislation to improve aviation security. The Chairman's bill contains many of the important security changes that the President has proposed, including the expanded deployment of Air Marshals on commercial flights, strengthening of cockpit security, law enforcement personnel at every screening location and stringent federal oversight of airline security screening. Importantly, it helps ensure the safety of our nation's airways by giving the Administration the ability to federalize security where it makes sense, while preserving the freedom to use high quality private screeners where it is safer and more effective. The President is eager to sign aviation security measures into law and looks forward to working with Chairman Young and other members of the Congress on these important security measures so they may be passed quickly.
