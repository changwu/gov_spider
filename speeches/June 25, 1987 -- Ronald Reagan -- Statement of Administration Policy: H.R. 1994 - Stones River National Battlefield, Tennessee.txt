    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Gordon (D) Tennessee and 14 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1994, because of section 2, which authorizes Federal land acquisition and construction of a trail linking the Stones River with Fortress Rosecrans, and Federal preservation of the Fortress. This site is of local significance only, and does not warrant the assistance authorized by section 2 of H.R. 1994.
