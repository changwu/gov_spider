    Today, at President Donald J. Trump's direction, the Department of the Treasury and Department of State announced important sanctions designations on individuals and entities actively supporting the murderous and barbaric Assad regime in Syria. Today's designations employ a wide range of sanctions authorities to target the Assad regime, including the Caesar Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020, which authorizes sanctions on individuals providing support to the Syrian government.
The targets of today's sanctions include regime-loyalists, Syrian financiers supporting corrupt reconstruction efforts, and individuals actively involved in the ceasefire disruption in northern Syria.
Since the 2011 start to the Syrian conflict, the Assad regime has committed innumerable atrocities against Syrians, including arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence, and murder. These despicable acts have devastated the country's people, infrastructure, and economy, displacing more than half of Syria's population.
Today's designations send a clear message that no individual or business should enter into business with or otherwise enrich such a vile regime.
Importantly, today's actions under the Caesar Act and Executive Orders 13894, 13582, and 13573 are intended to hold the murderous Assad regime accountable. They are not directed at the Syrian people.
This Administration is committed to a lasting political solution. The Assad regime and its patrons must recognize that a political resolution is the only viable mechanism to bring a peaceful end to the Syrian conflict.
