    Dear Madam Speaker: 
Thank you for your letter inviting me to deliver the State of the Union Address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, February 5, 2019. It is my great honor to accept. We have a great story to tell and yet, great goals to achieve!
I look forward to seeing you on the 5th.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
