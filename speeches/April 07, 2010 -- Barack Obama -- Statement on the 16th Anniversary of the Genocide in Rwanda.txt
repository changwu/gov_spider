    On this 16th commemoration of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, we devote our thoughts to those who were lost and honor those who survived. More than 800,000 men, women, and children were killed and countless others continue to live with the pain and trauma of their memories and their loss. It is not enough to say "never again." We must renew our commitment and redouble our efforts to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. We are inspired by the spirit of the Rwandan people to move forward, and we stand with the people of Rwanda and the international community in commemorating the genocide.
The United States is committed to its partnership with Rwanda and will continue to support efforts to promote sustainable development, respect for human rights, and sustainable peace in Rwanda and the region.
