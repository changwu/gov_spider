    I WAS shocked and horrified by the terrorist murder of Mr. Richard Welch outside his home in Athens, Greece. Mr. Welch has long been a dedicated official of the United States Government and the hearts of all Americans go out to his family in sympathy and in gratitude for a life given in devoted service to his country.
