"But it's been a tough 24 hours for McCain on the conservative issues. ... And then the endorsement by the 'New York Times' was just a big body-slam today." â€“ Kate Obenshain, Claire Booth Luce Policy Institute (Fox News' "Hannity And Colmes," 1/25/08)
The New York Times Has Endorsed Sen. John McCain By Praising His Not-So-Conservative Positions:
The New York Times: "Senator John McCain Of Arizona Is The Only Republican Who Promises To End The George Bush Style Of Governing." "Still, there is a choice to be made, and it is an easy one. Senator John McCain of Arizona is the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small, angry fringe." (Editorial, "Primary Choices: John McCain," The New York Times, 1/25/08)
The New York Times Supports Sen. McCain For Having Joined Democrats To Pass Legislation. "With a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation, he would offer a choice to a broader range of Americans than the rest of the Republican field." (Editorial, "Primary Choices: John McCain," The New York Times, 1/25/08)
- Global Warming: "Mr. McCain took a stand, just as he did in recognizing the threat of global warming early." (Editorial, "Primary Choices: John McCain," The New York Times, 1/25/08)
- McCain-Feingold: "He has been a staunch advocate of campaign finance reform, working with Senator Russ Feingold, among the most liberal of Democrats, on groundbreaking legislation..." (Editorial, "Primary Choices: John McCain," The New York Times, 1/25/08)
- McCain-Kennedy: "... just as he worked with Senator Edward Kennedy on immigration reform." (Editorial, "Primary Choices: John McCain," The New York Times, 1/25/08)

The New York Times Also Endorsed Sen. McCain In 2000, Praising Him For Challenging Republicans:
The New York Times: "We Endorse Mr. McCain" For The 2000 Republican Nomination. "So with a bow of respect to all four for reviving public interest in the election process, we endorse Mr. McCain as the preferable candidate for the Republicans and Mr. Gore as our choice for the Democratic nomination." (Edition, "Primary Endorsements," The New York Times, 3/5/00)
- The New York Times Praised Sen. McCain's Opposition To Then-Gov. Bush's Tax Cut Plan. "But the smarter course for Republicans would be to choose Mr. McCain, who would not have to be repackaged and repositioned when it comes to outreach and reform. He has a proven ability to get votes from the vital center of the American spectrum. He began with a vow to destroy the 'iron triangle' of donations, lobbyists and legislation. He broke further with the Republican leadership to oppose Mr. Bush's outsized tax-cut scheme as too weighted toward the wealthy." (Edition, "Primary Endorsements," The New York Times, 3/5/00)
- The New York Times Called Sen. McCain "A Zestful Insurgent Battling To Open His Party." "As a zestful insurgent battling to open his party, Mr. McCain has brought gusts of fresh air, excitement and common sense to American politics." (Edition, "Primary Endorsements," The New York Times, 3/5/00)
- The New York Times Praised Sen. McCain For His Attacks On "The Religious Right." "Bravely, and perhaps foolishly, he became the first important Republican figure to challenge leaders of the religious right for intimidating the party with religious-based litmus tests." (Edition, "Primary Endorsements," The New York Times, 3/5/00)

Conservatives Might Think Twice About John McCain, Given His Endorsement By The New York Times:
Laure Ingraham Said Conservatives Must "Take A Closer Look At" Sen. McCain After The Endorsement. LAURA INGRAHAM: "And Peggy, I think 'The New York Times' editorial board's endorsement of John McCain for conservatives, that's just - I mean, they look at that and they say, wait a second, we got to - we were supporting John McCain. We've got to take a closer look at him. So that's probably going to be difficult for that campaign as we continue this fight on the right." (Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor," 1/25/08)
Kate Obenshain Of The Clair Booth Luce Policy Institute Says The Endorsement Was "A Big Body-Slam" Against Sen. McCain. KATE OBENSHAIN: "But it's been a tough 24 hours for McCain on the conservative issues. ... And then the endorsement by the 'New York Times' was just a big body-slam today. So, he's got some comeback work to do." (Fox News' "Hannity And Colmes," 1/25/08)
Tucker Carlson: The New York Times Endorsement "Can't Help McCain." MSNBC'S TUCKER CARLSON: "The 'New York Times' has endorsed John McCain. John McCain has a problem with conservatives. Here is part of the endorsement, 'McCain has been a staunch advocate of campaign finance reform,' says the 'New York Times,' 'working with Senator Russ Feingold, among the most liberal of Democrats, on ground breaking legislation, just as he worked with Senator Ted Kennedy on immigration reform. That doesn't make him a moderate, but it does make him the best choice for his party's nomination.' That can't help McCain." (MSNBC's "Tucker," 1/25/08)
