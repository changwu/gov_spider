    The United States welcomes the decision of the European Union to expand its sanctions on Iran through the designation of over one hundred additional individuals and entities associated with Iranian proliferation-related activities. So long as Iran refuses to fulfill its international obligations, the international community will respond by continuing to hold Iran accountable, implement fully all UN Security Council resolutions, and aggressively counter Iranian proliferation activities. The United States remains fully committed to the peaceful resolution of international concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program.
