    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Keller (R) Florida and 119 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 339. Food manufacturers and sellers should not be held liable for injury because of a person's consumption of legal, unadulterated food and a person's weight gain or obesity. H.R. 339 would help prevent abuse of the legal system and help curb the growing problem of frivolous lawsuits in the United States. At the same time, the legislation would carefully preserve the right of individuals to have their day in court with non-frivolous civil liability actions. These civil actions are enumerated in the bill and respect the traditional role of the States in our Federal system with regard to such actions. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to make certain the legislation does not have unintended consequences as it moves forward.
