BY THE NUMBERS: 300,000 Newly Insured, More Health Care Options And Premiums Cut In Half Under The Massachusetts Health Care Plan:
Over Half Of the State's Uninsured Have Gotten Health Insurance Under The Massachusetts Health Care Reforms Led by Governor Romney. "While the tragic problem of the uninsured continues to grow in the U.S., Massachusetts has reversed this trend. Halfway through implementing reform, we have already significantly reduced our uninsured population. Some 300,000 new enrollees represents almost 5% of our entire state population and over half the (pre-reform) uninsured, by most credible estimates of that number." (Massachusetts Commonwealth Connector, http://www.mahealthconnector.org/, Accessed 1/25/08)
The Massachusetts Health Care Reforms Have Significantly Expanded Health Insurance Choices For Consumers. "After receiving bids from 10 carriers, for the first plan year, six different carriers are now offering 42 plan options through the Connector for the unsubsidized population, and enrollment in those plans began on May 1. That's approximately 41 more options than most Americans have today. Nationally, 80 percent of companies offering health benefits provide workers a choice of one plan - take it or leave it. Outside of federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Massachusetts citizens getting health insurance through the Connector are among the only group of Americans who can shop in a competitive health insurance market with such a broad range of health care choices." (Edmund F. Haislmaier, "The Massachusetts Health Reform: Assessing its Significance and Progress, Heritage Lecture #1077, 9/21/07)
The Massachusetts Health Care Reforms Have Slashed Health Insurance Premiums By Nearly Half. "Pre-reform, the lowest premium for a typical uninsured 37-year-old in Boston was $335 per month with a $5,000 annual deductible. Now, through the Connector, the same individual can get health coverage for $184 per month ($118 pre-tax) with a $2,000 deductible - well below the $250 a month target set back when the legislation was being developed. Indeed, most can get a health plan worth twice the value at half the price." (Edmund F. Haislmaier, "The Massachusetts Health Reform: Assessing its Significance and Progress, Heritage Lecture #1077, 9/21/07)
