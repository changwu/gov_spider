    Jill and I were saddened to hear of the passing of former Speaker Tom Foley. Tom was a good friend and a dedicated public servant. It was an honor to work with him during the budget summits of the 1980s that did so much to secure our nation's future, and when he served overseas as our nation's Ambassador to Japan. He was a good man.
