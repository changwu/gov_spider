    Nahigian: "This is not the year to settle."
Washington, D.C. â€” Team Bachmann campaign manager Keith Nahigian outlined the campaign's winning strategy today in a briefing called "Path to Victory." Nahigian pinpoints Bachmann's leadership and unwavering conservative principles as the reasons she is the only candidate in the GOP field that can defeat President Obama in 2012, and lays out Team Bachmann's plan to target the key caucus states of Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Florida.
"We are on the exact path we have designed and the exact path to victory," says Nahigian. "Constitutional conservatives and others in the past have been asked to settle in order to win. This is not the year to compromise. This is the year to finally elect somebody who is on the right side of all the issues and has a unique position to put us on a completely different path to restore America. Michele Bachmann is that conservative."
