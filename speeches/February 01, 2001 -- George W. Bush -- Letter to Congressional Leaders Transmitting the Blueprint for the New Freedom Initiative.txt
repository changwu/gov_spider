    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Enclosed please find the blueprint for my "New Freedom Initiative" to increase investment in and access to assistive technologies and a quality education, and help integrate Americans with disabilities into the workforce and into community life. I look forward to working with the Congress to ensure that these proposals are enacted into law and to working together to ensure that every American with a disability has access to the American dream.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
