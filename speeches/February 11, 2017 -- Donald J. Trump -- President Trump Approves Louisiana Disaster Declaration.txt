    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Louisiana and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds on February 7, 2017.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the parishes of Livingston and Orleans.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
Robert J. Fenton, Acting Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named William J. Doran III as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
Damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and more parishes and additional forms of assistance may be designated after the damage assessments are fully completed.
