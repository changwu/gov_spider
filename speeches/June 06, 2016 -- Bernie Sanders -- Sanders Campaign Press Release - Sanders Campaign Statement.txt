    SAN FRANCISCO - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs, on Monday issued the following statement:
"It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee's clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer.
"Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.
"Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump."
