    As the month of Ramadan draws to a close, Rosalynn and I send our warmest greetings and good wishes to our fellow Americans of the Moslem faith.
Strict adherence to your religious beliefs during this time of fasting has built discipline and character. It has inspired the true surrender to God which the word Moslem implies. And it has brought about a cleansing of the soul in preparation of the joyous celebration of the holiday of Id-al-Fitr.
We hope you will look back on this period of self-denial with the satisfaction of knowing that your prayers and fasting have strengthened your faith and expanded its positive influence as a force for good in modern life.
