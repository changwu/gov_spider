    HOUSTON, Texas – Over the weekend, Brent Bozell, the Founder and President of the Media Research Center, who has endorsed Ted Cruz for President, penned an op-ed in Breitbart urging conservatives to join the grassroots movement and unite behind Cruz because he's a fearless leader and "he's the one candidate who is going to return this country to her Constitutional foundations and Judeo-Christian values."

Exclusive–Bozell: It's Time To Rally Around Ted Cruz

Ted Cruz is surging.  He's on top in Iowa. He's gaining ground everywhere else. He has organizations in place in every state that matters.  He's raised more money than anyone except Jeb Bush.
There's a reason for this. Conservatives nationally are seeing that he's the one candidate who is going to return this country to her Constitutional foundations and Judeo—Christian values.
On every issue of crucial importance to conservatives—defunding Planned Parenthood, ending the Obamacare nightmare, reducing the size of government, opposing amnesty—Cruz is not only with conservatives, he's led the fight for conservatives.
Some Republicans vote the right way on these issues. Few stick their necks out and challenge the Washington DC GOP establishment. He's done it over and over, fearlessly. It's what leaders do.
Some say him constantly doing this makes Cruz one of the most reviled men in Washington.
It's hard to imagine a more prestigious title. America is fed up with the establishment in Washington, especially the Republican leadership that constantly flat-out lies to voters promising an agenda they have no intention of honoring.
