    Earlier today, Buchanan Campaign Co-Chairman Larry Pratt took a leave of absence from the campaign following revelations that he has been a featured speaker at meetings organized by white supremacists. Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed today demanded that Buchanan immediately fire Pratt. The following is the text of Reed's statement:
"There can be no allowance made for poisonous notions of racism and anti-Semitism. Given all the controversy over his musings on the Holocaust, Pat Buchanan should know that better than anyone. There is only one legitimate option for Pat Buchanan: Fire Mr. Pratt and apologize to those Mr. Pratt has offended."
