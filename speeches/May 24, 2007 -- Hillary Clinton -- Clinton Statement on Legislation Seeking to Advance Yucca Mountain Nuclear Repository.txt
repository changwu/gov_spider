    Senator Hillary Clinton issued the following statement in response to legislation introduced yesterday by Senators Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico) and Larry Craig (R- Idaho) seeking to advance development of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear repository.
"I have long opposed storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. This latest attempt to push forward development of the project is particularly reckless, as it aims to increase spending and begin construction on the site prior to license approval. There are far too many unanswered questions about both the geology of the site and integrity of the science to support the decision to store waste at Yucca at all -- let alone to justify accelerating the site's development.
"Continued attempts to push this misguided project forward are both disappointing and irresponsible. As President, I will work with the scientific community to examine all options for safe, secure storage of nuclear waste as part of a comprehensive national energy policy."
