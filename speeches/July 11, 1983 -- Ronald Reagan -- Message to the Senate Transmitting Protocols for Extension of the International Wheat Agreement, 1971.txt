    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocols for the Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, and the Food Aid Convention, 1980, which Conventions constitute the International Wheat Agreement, 1971. The Protocols were adopted by the International Wheat Council which met in London in December 1982 and were open for signature in Washington from April 4 through May 10, 1983. They were signed by the Secretary of Agriculture for the United States on April 25, 1983.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Protocols.
The Protocols extend both Conventions through June 30, 1986. They maintain the framework for international cooperation in wheat trade matters, continue the existence of the International Wheat Council, and extend the parties' commitments to provide minimum annual quantities of cereals food aid to developing countries.
I ask that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the two Protocols so that ratification by the United States can be effected at an early date. Doing so will demonstrate our continued commitment to cooperation on international wheat trade matters and to providing food aid to needy developing nations.
