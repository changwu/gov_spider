MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Cruz for President campaign has released a video halfway through his #CruzCountry bus tour highlighting the overwhelming crowds that are turning out to his events throughout the Southern states. No event has had fewer than 500 people, with the largest crowd nearing 2,000 mark. Combined, all the states he will visit represent 356 of the 1,236 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.


As of Tuesday, August 11, Cruz has made multiple stops in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee — all states where he has released strong leadership teams that will continue to build his robust grassroots network in each state. The #CruzCountry #CruzToVictory Bus Tour continues on through Arkansas and will conclude in Oklahoma on Thursday, August 13.
