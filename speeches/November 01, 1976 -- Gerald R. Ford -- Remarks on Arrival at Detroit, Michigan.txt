    Gee, it is nice to be back. It is nice to be back in Michigan.
Within hours after I received the nomination in Kansas City, I told Betty that I would open this campaign at home. It is the best way that I could say to my friends and the citizens of my home State, thank you. Thank you for all that you have done for me the past 28 years.
I said in my acceptance speech, the speech to the American people, it is from your ranks that I come and on your side that I stand. There is no place on the Earth where that statement is more true than among all of you here in Michigan today.
I am the first son of Michigan to serve as President of the United States. I am part of this great State, its people, and its belief in America. You first sent me to Congress 28 years ago, and in those 28 years my deep feelings for Michigan have matured into a total loyalty as well as a deep love.
I come to you now to seek your support for my election to the highest office in the land. I know you will support me as you always have. May I tell you how important that really is? Someone once said you can tell a lot about a man by the way his family feels about him. Michigan is my family.
From the kids--Mike, Jack, Steve, Susan--from Betty and of course from myself, thanks from the bottom of my heart, for your wonderful support, your continued prayers, and your belief in Jerry Ford.
Thank you very much.
