    I respect the very difficult decision Trent made on behalf of the American people. As Majority and Minority Leader of the Senate, Trent Lott improved education for the American people; he led the way in securing tax relief; he strengthened our national security; and he stood for a bold and effective foreign policy. Trent is a valued friend, and a man I respect. I am pleased he will continue to serve our Nation in the Senate, and I look forward to working with him on our agenda to make America safer, stronger, and better.
