    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement:
"I believe Senator Clinton should be held to the same standard that every one of us should be held to - tell the truth, no more double-talk and no defending a broken system.
"What I heard from Senator Clinton on Tuesday night was more of the same double-talk—and the American people are tired of it. We need a president who will say the same thing all the time.
"If the Democrats want to win in 2008, it is crucial that we nominate a candidate who can restore the trust between the president and the American people. What we saw in the debate were the 'politics of double-talk.' I have a really simple rule: if you get asked a yes or no question you shouldn't give a yes and no answer."
