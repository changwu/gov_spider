    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the Obama Administration's decision to allow Raul Castro's daughter to travel to the United States:
"I am greatly disturbed by the Obama Administration's decision to allow Mariel Castro, daughter of Raul Castro, to travel to the United States. We shouldn't be extending an open hand to a regime engaged in the systematic and flagrant denial of basic human rights. While the Cuban regime engages in a fierce crackdown on dissent and continues to unjustly imprison one of our own citizens, Alan Gross, the Obama Administration should not be welcoming the daughter of a dictator. The United States should be standing up for those on the island who are risking their very lives fighting for freedom."
