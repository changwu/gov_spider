    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Oregon and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a severe winter storm and flooding during the period of December 14-15, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storm and flooding in Benton, Clatsop, Columbia, Lincoln, Polk, Tillamook, Wheeler, and Yamhill Counties, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
