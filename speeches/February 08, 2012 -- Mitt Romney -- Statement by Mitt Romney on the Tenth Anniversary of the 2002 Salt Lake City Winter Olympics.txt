    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the tenth anniversary of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics:
"We're now ten years out from the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. I have many memories, but one I will never forget is of the American flag that had flown above the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 being carried into the opening ceremony. The reverence with which it was greeted was a powerful reminder that the American spirit was unbroken. I was deeply honored to have been asked to lead the Olympics and am proud that the games were such a memorable success. I'm delighted that Utah is thinking about bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Our great nation is wonderfully suited to host the world's greatest sporting competition."
