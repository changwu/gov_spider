    WASHINGTON â€“ In a new video released on Tuesday by Bernie 2020, actor and writer Hari Nef announced her endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign for president. Nef cites the senator's consistency on issues of social justice as her reason for endorsing.
"Bernie is looking at things like health care for all, a living wage for all, jobs for all, education for all," Nef says in the video. "So much of the power, and the wealth, and the resources are hoarded by a select few who then make all the decisions for everybody else. Bernie is really the only candidate who seems to understand that, and who wants to upend that structure completely."
The news comes on the heels of endorsements from prominent actors, artists and activists Kirsten Dunst, Eve Ensler, Sarah Silverman and Kristen Wiig. It also comes as fourteen states hold their presidential primaries on Super Tuesday.
