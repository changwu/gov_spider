Travel Pool Report #3: NAC spray
POTUS entered the NAC session at 10:20 am local time.
Some photographers were allowed to observe a greeting between NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg and POTUS close up --- but the print pooler was required to stand on a platform on the far side of the large room and heard nothing. The spray lasted about 4 minutes, with Stoltenberg giving brief remarks after the two men sat down. Pool was immediately escorted out of the room and is being taken to a hold until the press conference.
The pool was not allowed to remain in the room for the president's remarks.

Travel Pool Report #4: more color and Stoltenberg remarks
Our friends in the stills community, who had a close view of the president, said that after POTUS took his seat next to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the leaders discussed what they did the previous evening. Pool has no audio of that conversation.
At the top of the NAC session, Stoltenberg said: "Today we are discussing challenges in our southern neighborhood and the fight against terrorism. The Middle East, North Africa and the Sahara regions face interconnected security, demographic economic and political challenges, aggravated by the impact of climate change and food insecurity caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.
"It is in our interest to continue working with our close partners in the south to fight shared challenges together. Today we will discuss how NATO can address the causes of instability and step up our efforts in the fight against terrorism."
Pool is now in a hold room at the NATO Summit site, where it expects to remain until the president's afternoon press conference.
