    New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to Outline Strategy to Prevent Nuclear Terrorism
New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson on Wednesday will outline his comprehensive strategy for handling the threat of nuclear terrorism, the most urgent threat to the security of America and the world. Â Governor Richardson will reveal his plan during a speech to the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, DC.
Governor Richardson's speech will discuss the risk of nuclear terrorism, and detail his plan to prevent it. He will propose specific steps on stopping nuclear proliferation, on securing all nuclear weapons and fissile material in the world, and on consolidating all future nuclear enrichment and spent-fuel disposal into a limited number of highly secure sites.
"America led the world into the age of nuclear fear because we were compelled to do so by totalitarian enemies. We now have the urgent moral duty to lead the world out of the age of nuclear fear -- ironically because we confront a very new and different kind of totalitarian enemy," said Governor Richardson.
This comprehensive plan is an example of Governor Richardson's "New Realism" in action -- American diplomatic leadership to deal with the new realities of the 21st century.
