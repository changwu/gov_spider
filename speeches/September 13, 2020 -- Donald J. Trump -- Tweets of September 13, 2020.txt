Once again, Sleepy Joe told the press they could go home at 9 A.M. Meanwhile, your Favorite President, me, will go to Reno, Nevada tonight, three stops in Las Vegas tomorrow, with California and Arizona on schedule Monday. Don't worry, we won't be taking off Tuesday, either!Retweets: 30801Favorites: 143213

While I travel the Country, Joe sleeps in his basement, telling the Fake News Media to "get lost". If you're a reporter covering Sleepy Joe, you have basically gone into retirement!Retweets: 26828Favorites: 124481

Just landed in Nevada but while on Air Force One watched most vicious TV commercial I have ever seen. Pathetic Joe's people placed an unsourced ad where they have me saying unthinkable things about soldiers while standing over their graves. It is a MADE UP LIE. A TOTAL CON JOB!Retweets: 37723Favorites: 151958

Joe Biden cannot LEAD our Country, because he does not BELIEVE in our Country. At Biden's convention, they decried America as a wicked, sinful nation, destined for a fate of doom and despair. They even removed the words "Under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance – twice...Retweets: 28398Favorites: 111805

...The far-left maniacs supporting Joe Biden are burning flags and chanting "America was never great." But we know the truth: America is the most Exceptional Nation on earth, and our destiny is blessed by God!Retweets: 16989Favorites: 72068

I am running for re-election to bring prosperity to Nevada, to put violent criminals behind bars, and to ensure the future belongs to AMERICA—NOT China. If we win, AMERICA WINS! If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden Wins, the rioters, anarchists, and arsonists win. VOTE! #MAGARetweets: 34475Favorites: 135835

I thought Mini Mike was through with Democrat politics after spending almost 2 Billion Dollars, and then giving the worst and most inept Debate Performance in the history of Presidential Politics.

In the highly competitive world of high tech, how come nobody has ever challenged Mini Mike Bloomberg and his very average, & supposedly outdated, "stuff" that he sells to so many? Did he use his position as Mayor of New York to create what is now a monopoly? Just askin'?Retweets: 21983Favorites: 92583

But people don't want to get mugged, beaten up, or killed. Let New York's Finest (who proudly endorsed me!) do their job. Rehire crime squad and fired police. They will bring safety back to NYC, FAST!!! https://t.co/u14t0oSNVNRetweets: 16714Favorites: 58747

Sleepy Joe Biden has spent 47 years in politics being terrible to Hispanics. Now he is relying on Castro lover Bernie Sanders to help him out. That won't work!
