  A Proclamation

Home care enhances life for people of all ages who are ill or disabled. The home should be the setting of first choice for care and treatment, because it is conducive to healing; in the home, family members can supply caring and love. The combination of professional services with such situations can add to the effectiveness of home health care. National Home Care Week, 1988, reminds us of the good that results when families and home care providers put into practice the respect we all owe to everyone in need of such care.
In recent years, home care programs have grown in number and in importance in health care delivery. We should all be grateful that these programs enable millions of Americans to receive fine care at home. The employees and volunteers of home care agencies, private and public alike, need our cooperation and attention as they work with family members across our land to offer the excellent care patients at home require and deserve.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-600, has designated the period of November 27 through December 3, 1988, as "National Home Care Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of November 27 through December 3, 1988, as National Home Care Week, and I call upon government officials, interested organizations and associations, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.

RONALD REAGAN
