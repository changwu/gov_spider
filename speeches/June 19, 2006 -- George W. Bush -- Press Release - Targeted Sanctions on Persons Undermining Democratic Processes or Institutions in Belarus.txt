    Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the President has issued an Executive Order imposing targeted financial sanctions on certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons responsible for undermining Belarus' democratic processes or institutions, human rights abuses, or public corruption.
The order immediately blocks all property and interests in property of the persons listed in the Annex to the order. It prohibits U.S. companies and individuals from engaging in any transactions with the targeted persons. These persons will not be able to access any assets that they might have in the United States, and U.S. financial institutions, wherever located, will not be able to provide any financial services to them.
The United States, the European Union, and other partners have repeatedly expressed support for the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus and condemned the government's human rights abuses, assaults on democracy, and corruption. The fraudulent presidential election in March 2006, repression of post-election demonstrators, and continued detention of activists and opposition supporters, including former Presidential candidate Alexander Kozulin and four leaders of the election monitoring organization Partnership, mark only the latest chapter in the government's efforts to stifle the rights of the Belarusian people. These sanctions, imposed in coordination with targeted financial sanctions adopted by the European Union, indicate the international community's intention to hold to account those responsible for abuses in Belarus.
The Executive Order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to designate and block the property of additional persons. The U.S. Government will continue to gather and review information regarding possible additional targets.
