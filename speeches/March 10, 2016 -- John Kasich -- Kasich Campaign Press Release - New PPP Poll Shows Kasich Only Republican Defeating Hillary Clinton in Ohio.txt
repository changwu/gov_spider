Democrats are looking pretty good for the general election for President in Ohio- as long as John Kasich doesn't end up somehow snagging the nomination. Hillary Clinton leads Marco Rubio 44/41, and both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump 45/40- leads that are pretty well in line with how much Barack Obama won the state by in 2008 and 2012. Bernie Sanders does comparably well, leading Rubio 42/38, Trump 44/40, and Cruz 44/38. It's a whole different ballgame with Kasich though. Unlike Rubio who's become incredibly unpopular at home over the course of his Presidential bid, Kasich has remained very popular with a 54/36 approval spread. He leads Clinton 52/37 and Sanders 54/34 in head to heads.
As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.
