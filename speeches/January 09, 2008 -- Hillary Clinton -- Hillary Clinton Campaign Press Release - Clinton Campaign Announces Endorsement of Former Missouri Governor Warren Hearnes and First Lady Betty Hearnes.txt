    Former Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes, along with former First Lady Betty, today endorsed Hillary Clinton's Campaign for President.
"Hillary has the strength and experience to lead our nation. As someone who has spent a lifetime diligently working to improve Missouri's public education system, I personally applaud Hillary for her continuous commitment to reforming our public schools - both during her time in Arkansas and now in the United States Senate," said Gov. Hearnes. "That's the kind of leadership we need in Washington.
"Hillary's campaign operation in Missouri is strong, with a large volunteer network that is already hard at work, phone banking and spreading the word about Hillary's experience and commitment to the issues that matter most to Missouri families. Rest assured that if you cast a vote for Hillary, she will be ready to lead you - and our country -- from day one in the White House."
Hearnes, who served as Governor of Missouri from 1965 to 1973, was the first Missouri Governor ever to serve two consecutive terms. During his time in office, Hearnes was a strong champion and advocate for Missouri's public schools, and worked diligently during his time in office to improve Missouri's education system. His endorsement today strengthens Hillary's support in the southeastern portion of Missouri, particularly in the "Bootheel" area.
Hearnes joins a list of high-level Hillary supporters in Missouri, including Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, former Governor Bob Holden, and former Secretary of State Bekki Cook. The Campaign recently released its statewide Missouri Steering Committee, which is diverse and includes leaders from the labor and business community, as well as faith leaders and community activists.
