    The President welcomes the release from prison in South Africa of Govan Mbeki, one of the leaders of the African National Congress sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964. The South African Government is to be congratulated for this gesture of conciliation toward the majority black population. The President hopes this action leads to a rapid process of negotiation designed to give all South Africans equal political and constitutional rights.
In welcoming Mr. Mbeki's release, the President renews our concern for the remaining political prisoners in South Africa such as Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and others who should be released so that the process of political change can be pursued with confidence and in a nonviolent manner.
