Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for 'two and a half years.' In other words she lied. This was the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats plan all along long before the Ukraine phone call. Impeachment Hoax!Retweets: 39159Favorites: 137840

Congratulations to Boris Johnson on his great WIN! Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U. Celebrate Boris!Retweets: 47098Favorites: 200601

The Republicans House members were fantastic yesterday. It always helps to have a much better case in fact the Dems have no case at all but the unity & sheer brilliance of these Republican warriors all of them was a beautiful sight to see. Dems had no answers and wanted out!Retweets: 20588Favorites: 84961

Poll numbers have gone through the roof in favor of No Impeachment especially with Swing States and Independents in Swing States. People have figured out that the Democrats have no case it is a total Hoax. Even Pelosi admitted yesterday that she began this scam 2 1/2 years ago!Retweets: 21590Favorites: 87662

The Wall Street Journal story on the China Deal is completely wrong especially their statement on Tariffs. Fake News. They should find a better leaker!Retweets: 27081Favorites: 109086

We have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China. They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product Energy and Manufactured Goods plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder....Retweets: 25680Favorites: 98619


 December 13, 2019 15:25:52
.....The Penalty Tariffs set for December 15th will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal. We will begin negotiations on the Phase Two Deal immediately rather than waiting until after the 2020 Election. This is an amazing deal for all. Thank you!Retweets: 17036Favorites: 67303
