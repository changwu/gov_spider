    I take great pleasure in marking the 1-year anniversary of the first National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas. I think the most meaningful manner in which I can take note of that historic occasion is to call, once again, for ratification of the equal rights amendment.
Many women who were delegates to Houston and to the State conventions which preceded the Houston conference were active in the recent successful effort to extend the ratification deadline 3 more years. My administration and members of my family enthusiastically supported that effort.
This week women all over the country who attended the Houston conference are measuring the progress on the plan of action they adopted 1 year ago. I have recently released a report indicating my administration's action in furtherance of that plan for women's equality.
We will continue to work to realize other goals set forth by the women's conference. It is in the national interest for all citizens to participate fully in every part of American life.
