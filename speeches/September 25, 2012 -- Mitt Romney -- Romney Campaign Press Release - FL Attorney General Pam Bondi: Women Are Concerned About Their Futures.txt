    Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi today made the following statement on Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter's comments that women aren't concerned about what's happened over the last four years:  
"The Obama campaign's recent remark that women aren't really concerned about what's happened over the last four years is wrong and demeaning.  President Obama's lack of leadership to revitalize our economy, and out of control federal spending, has led to unprecedented levels of debt, the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, and record levels of poverty. These issues have a tremendous impact, and are of great concern to all women in our nation who are pursuing careers and raising their families. I have personally travelled around Florida with Governor Romney and to other states as his surrogate and know firsthand that women in our nation are angry that President Obama has put their futures, and the futures of their children at risk. These women, without a doubt, are concerned about the kind of future their children will inherit, and just like all Americans, want and deserve leadership that will deliver a real economic recovery."
