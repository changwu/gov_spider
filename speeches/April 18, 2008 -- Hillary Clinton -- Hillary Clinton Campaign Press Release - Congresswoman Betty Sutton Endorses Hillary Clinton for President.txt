    Congresswoman Betty Sutton today announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President. Sutton represents Ohio's 13th Congressional District.
"We are fortunate as a Party and a nation to have two such incredible candidates in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination," said Sutton. "On March 4th, the majority of Democratic voters in the 13th Congressional District and Ohio chose to support Senator Hillary Clinton with their vote. As the Representative for Ohio's 13th Congressional District, I am pledging my support to her as well. "
"I have had the opportunity to engage in significant discussions with Senator Clinton about the concerns and hopes of the people I am so honored to represent. She has demonstrated a keen understanding of the pressing issues, such as the need to create economic opportunity for working families right here in Northeast Ohio."
Sutton served eight years in the Ohio State House prior to being elected to represent Ohio's 13th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006. Before being elected to Congress, she worked as a labor attorney fighting for the rights of Ohio's workers. Sutton is known as a no-nonsense, capable leader who can build consensus to get the job done. In Congress, she serves on the House Rules Committee and the House Judiciary Committee.
"I am pleased to have the support of Congresswoman Betty Sutton, who is known as a champion for the middle class," said Hillary Clinton. "I am looking forward to working with Betty to advance opportunities for the hardworking people of Ohio and across this great nation by expanding local business opportunities, making college more accessible, reforming our trade policies, investing in our infrastructure and fighting to provide families with access to quality and affordable health care."
