    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Vento (D) Minnesota)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 828 unless title II is deleted. Title II, which was added to the bill without a hearing, would make a number of substantive changes in the way the Secretary of the Interior manages public lands. These changes would hamper, rather than facilitate, effective land management.
