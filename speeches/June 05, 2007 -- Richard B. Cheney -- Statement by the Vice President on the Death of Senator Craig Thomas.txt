    I am greatly saddened by the passing of my friend and colleague Senator Craig Thomas. Craig was a public servant of the first rank: honest, decent, and devoted to his constituents. During Craig's long career in office, the people of Wyoming counted on him to represent their interests with common sense and integrity. He never let us down, and even in a time of serious illness Craig was faithful to his duties in the United States Senate. His passing represents a profound loss to the Senate, to Wyoming, and to America. We will miss Craig Thomas, and we'll always be grateful for his legacy of honorable service and personal courage. Lynne and I send our deepest sympathy to Craig's wife, Susan, and their entire family. We are thinking of them in this sad hour.
