"FALLING THROUGH"
TV :30
Hillary Clinton: The Bush economy is like a trapdoor.
Too many families are one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment, one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything.
The oil companies, the predatory student loan companies, the insurance companies and the drug companies have had seven years of a president who stands up for them.
I intend to be a president who stands up for all of you.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
