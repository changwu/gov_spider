President Obama broke his promise to address illegal immigration, leaving states and businesses in an untenable situation. As governor, I took aggressive steps towards better enforcement of illegal immigration, but ultimately we need a President who will be serious about fixing America's immigration system.
"I also am pleased that Justice Elena Kagen properly recused herself from participating in this ruling because of her previous position as President Obama's Solicitor General, a precedent she must also follow when Obamacare is presented before the court."
