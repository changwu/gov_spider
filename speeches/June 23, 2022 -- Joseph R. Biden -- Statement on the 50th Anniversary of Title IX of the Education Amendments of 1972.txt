    Fifty years ago, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink—the first woman of color elected to Congress—led the effort to write and pass title IX, which President Nixon signed into law. Title IX stated that no one should be excluded from participation or face discrimination on the basis of sex in any education programs or activity receiving Federal assistance. It consisted of just 37 words of legislative language, but it transformed our Nation.
Over the last 50 years, our Nation has made monumental progress in advancing equity and equality for all students, including by narrowing gender gaps in sports, expanding opportunities in science and technology fields, and protecting students from sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment and sexual violence.
This is what America is all about: possibilities. Millions of women and girls have benefited from the change that title IX helped make possible. More women and girls are participating and excelling in countless fields—from professional sports, to science, math, and technology—than ever before. Their leadership, achievements, and success bear out the legacy of countless women throughout history who fought hard for a place at the table and for equal opportunity in all fields.
Yet there is more work to do. As we look to the next 50 years, I am committed to protecting this progress and working to achieve full equality, inclusion, and dignity for women and girls, LGBTQI+ Americans, all students, and all Americans.
My administration will continue to fight tirelessly to realize the promise of title IX: that every person deserves an opportunity to pursue their education free from discrimination and realize their full potential.
