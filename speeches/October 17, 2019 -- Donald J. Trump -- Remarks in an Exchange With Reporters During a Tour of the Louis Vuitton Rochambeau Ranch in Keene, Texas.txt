And he's really an artist. To me, Bernard is an artist. And what he's done is incredible, not only here, but in terms of the branding—the world of brands. And it's an honor to have him in Texas.

The President. Well, I can't tax him because he moved to the United States. So he was——

The President. Well, we're very happy. And I want to thank President Erdogan of Turkey. I want to thank all of the leaders of the Kurds. Many people came into store for this. And it was unconventional, but they saw that was not working out, what they were doing. And we're very happy with the way that worked out. Very, very successful.
And now, over the next number of days, things are going to happen that are going to be very positive. There's a lot of good will going on right now in Turkey with the Kurds and with everybody involved. Many, many people are involved. But I want to thank Mike Pence. I want to thank Mike Pompeo. They did a fantastic job. All of my representatives who went over there 2 days ago, late in the evening, and got there—and not easy to do, and little bit dangerous to do, also—they did a fantastic job.

Q. So what happened on the plane today? Did he just formalize it and hand you the letter?

Q. Yes.
