    Thank you all for coming. Laura and I are really honored to be back in Mississippi with the Governor and the first lady. And most of all, we're pleased to be with those who are helping to educate the young here on the gulf coast.
We, of course, want to thank those who are helping this important part of the country rebuild. Part of rebuilding the community is to make sure that the schools are able to function well and teach children how to read and write and add and subtract. Laura and I are committed to making sure no child is left behind anywhere in the United States of America.
Particularly want to thank the superintendent, the principal, and the teachers for helping this important part of the country recover from devastating storm.
And now it's my honor to introduce the First Lady, who is going to make an announcement.
