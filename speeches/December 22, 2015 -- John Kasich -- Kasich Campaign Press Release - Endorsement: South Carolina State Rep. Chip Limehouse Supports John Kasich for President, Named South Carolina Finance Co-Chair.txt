    South Carolina State Representative Chip Limehouse today endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and joined Kasich for America's South Carolina leadership team as a state co-chair and state finance co-chair.
Said Limehouse: "Gov. Kasich demonstrates the kind of conservative leadership that will put America back on the path to prosperity. As governor of Ohio he's cut taxes, restrained spending and worked with Ohioans to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. He has a plan to defeat ISIS on the ground and keep the country safe. He spearheaded the effort to balance the federal budget for the first time in a generation, and he has a plan to do it again. Voters in South Carolina are ready to elect a candidate with a record of results and a realistic plan for the future. Gov. Kasich is that leader, and I look forward to working with the rest of the team to take his message to voters." Limehouse is a real estate executive representing the 110th State District of South Carolina, which encompasses Charleston County.
Said Kasich, "The Limehouse name is second to none in the Lowcountry. State Rep. Chip Limehouse has worked tirelessly for the state of South Carolina and knows how to get things done. He brings valuable expertise and experience to our grassroots operations, and it's a real honor to welcome him to the team."
State Senators Paul Campbell, Jr., Ray Cleary, & Greg Gregory; and State Representatives Jeffrey Bradley and Gary Clary also serve as co-chairs.
