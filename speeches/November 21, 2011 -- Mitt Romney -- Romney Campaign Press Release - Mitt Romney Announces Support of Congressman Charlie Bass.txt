Congressman Bass will appear with Mitt Romney today at BAE Systems in Nashua, NH.
"Congressman Bass and his family have served New Hampshire with honor and distinction for generations," said Mitt Romney. "He has stood up for the traditional New Hampshire principles of limited taxation and smaller government. In addition, Congressman Bass understands that the current over-taxation and over-spending in Washington will only continue to hurt job creators. With his support, I hope to reverse the failed Obama fiscal policies that have hampered job creation and put a halt to economic growth."
"Voters in New Hampshire and across our country are looking for a candidate that understands what our economy needs to recover and grow, that has the experience of creating jobs, and has the leadership qualities needed to bring the citizens of our nation back together in these challenging times," stated Congressman Bass. "I firmly believe that Mitt Romney is the candidate that will renew our country's faith in the American Dream. I am proud to endorse Governor Romney today for President of the United States."
