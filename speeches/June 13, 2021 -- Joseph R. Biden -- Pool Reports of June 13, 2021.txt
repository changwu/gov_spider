Windsor supplemental pool #3 - Final 
Forwarding on behalf of AP’s Kelvin Chan:
POTUS and FLOTUS arrived at Windsor Castle for their meeting with Queen Elizabeth II accompanied by one of the hottest days of the year so far in the U.K. The sun was fierce and the skies were dazzlingly blue.
Ahead of their arrival, soldiers from the Queen’s Company First Battalion Grenadier Guards assembled in an honour guard formation on the well manicured lawn in the castle’s Quadrangle.
Riding in the back of a black Land Rover, POTUS and FLOTUS arrived at 505pm local UIK time at the castle’s Quadrangle via the King George IV gateway. They were driven around the Quadrangle in a clockwise direction before arriving at a dais where the Queen was waiting to greet them. She had arrived minutes before, walking over from a doorway in a corner of the Quadrangle leading to her apartment in the castle. The queen, 95, was wearing a pink dress and hat. She had celebrated her official birthday the day before ( though her actual birthday is in April).
Upon arrival at Windsor Castle, the President and the First Lady were greeted by: Mr. James Puxley, HM Lord-Lieutenant of the Royal County of Berkshire; Admiral Sir James Perowne, Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle Vice-Admiral and Sir Anthony Johnstone-Burt, Master of the Household.
The First Lady was wearing a baby blue suit and was seen tucking her mask into her pocket. The President wore a navy blue suit and kept his aviator sunglasses on while they stood at attention for a royal salute and for the playing of the Star Spangled Banner. (The UK anthem, God Save the Queen, was played minutes before the couple arrived.)The President then took part in an Inspection of the Guard of Honor accompanied by Major James Taylor, Captain of the Regiment, and Major General Christopher Ghika, Captain of the Guard. The President walked down the first line of troops, with what appeared to be quite a stern expression on his face - at times it appeared that he was frowning. As he got to the end of the row, one of the senior guardsman escorting the President went walked around in front of him, turned to face him and raised his sword to up to his face four times, which elicited a grin from the President. He also made some comments which I was not able to hear.
The President was then escorted back to the dais where all three watched the military march past. After the soldiers left, the three left the dais. After the President walked down the steps, he offered his elbow to the queen who appeared to momentarily consider taking it before declining. As the three walked to the queen's apartment, the queen was overheard introducing her ladies in waiting to POTUS and FLOTUS. They disappeared into the castle at 518pm local UK time for tea with the Queen. It was a private meeting and the press pool were then escorted off the grounds.
