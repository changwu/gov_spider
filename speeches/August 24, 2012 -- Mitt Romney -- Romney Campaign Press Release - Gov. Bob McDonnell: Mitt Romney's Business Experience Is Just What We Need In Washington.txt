GOV. BOB MCDONNELL: "Well, I think the President's played a smallball campaign strategy while the economy and jobs and debt and the deficit and energy clearly are the top issues. He's talking about tax returns and Bain Capital. Bain's experience for Mitt Romney I think shows he knows how to create jobs in the private sector and as you just pointed out, he knows how to make decisions. We've got Washington that's basically at a standstill, can't get things done. The President's been a bystander, not a strong leader. And I think people are getting a great sense of that and no plan to get us out of the debt and get America back to work. I do think that his management experience, as well as experience as a governor, of course, I'm biased, is a real asset to him in the campaign."
