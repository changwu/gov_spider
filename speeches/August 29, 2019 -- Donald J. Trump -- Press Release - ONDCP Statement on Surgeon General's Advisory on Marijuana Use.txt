Today, Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Jim Carroll released the following statement after Surgeon General Vice Adm. Jerome M. Adams issued an advisory emphasizing the importance of protecting youth and pregnant women from the health risks of marijuana use.
"Today's advisory serves as an important reminder of the health risks marijuana use poses, especially when it comes to young people and pregnant women. While laws in some states have changed, the scientific evidence increasingly shows the harmful effects of marijuana use. We are focused on making sure all Americans are aware of the dangers of marijuana use and the impact it has on developing minds. The White House continues to make record investments to support community coalitions across the country that are dedicated to preventing youth substance use before it begins," ONDCP Director Jim Carroll said.
