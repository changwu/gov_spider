    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, I am pleased to transmit the Ninth Annual Report on Federal Advisory Committees.
This Report, which was prepared by the General Services Administration, summarizes the activities, status, and changes in the composition of Federal Advisory Committees for calendar year 1980.
On January 22, 1981, I directed all Executive departments and agencies to reduce obligations for advisory committees by five percent for 1981. As part of the annual review of advisory committees, which will begin in April, we will scrutinize the activities and responsibilities of each advisory committee to determine whether it should be renewed or abolished.
