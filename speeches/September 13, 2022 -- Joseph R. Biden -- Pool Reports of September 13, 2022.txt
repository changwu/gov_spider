WH Print Pool 6, 9/13/22
Joe Biden, wearing his signature sun glasses, now takes the podium - "Hello everyone back there!" To the crowds on the lawn.
He then took off his coat and began his speech, hailing Jacobs, James Taylor, his wife, Harris - and Sen. Joe Manchin. Then all Dem lawmakers.
Walking back and forth on the platform with mic in his hands, Biden delivered a rallying cry for the legislation with several rounds of applause.
He addressed inflation - saying the IRA lowers the deficit and policies overtime will lower it - drug price caps, lower ACA insurance costs, climate measures including tax credits for EVs creating union jobs, tax hikes on big on $400,000+ households, adding 10 million-plus jobs, and "progress."
He also vowed to ban the sale of assault weapons.
Introducing the president was Lovette Jacobs, 5th year International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103 electrical apprentice and member of the Electrical Workers Minority Caucus & Women's Caucus
Jacobs praised Biden for supporting labor unions, and repeated the theme of promises made, promises kept.
VP Harris opened the final speeches, saying the Biden administration had delivered on its promise to help the country, and praised the resilience of the American people. She highlighted funds for infrastructure and the climate legislation.

Out-of-town pool report #5 â Questions
POTUS emerged from the center at 7:22 and answered a few questions.
Asked whether Ukraine has reached a turning point in the war:
"The question is unanswerable. It's hard to tell. It's clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress. But it's going to be a long haul."
Asked about the stock market:
"The stock market doesn't necessarily reflect the state of the economy, as you all know," he said. The economy is still strong, unemployment is low."
Asked about whether he is worried about inflation:
"No, I'm not," he said. "We're talking one tenth of one percent."
POTUS declined to answer questions on the looming rail strike.
Thanks to WHCA pooler for assistance pulling quotes.
