    Chicago, IL - Below is a statement from Senator Barack Obama on the financial markets:
"Today's developments in the market are a welcome sign that the global economic cooperation we saw this weekend - along with vigorous measures, including plans to recapitalize our financial institutions - are helping to restore confidence in our markets. But the tremendous volatility we are seeing in the market is a sign that we still face significant economic uncertainty. We have not yet solved the financial crisis, and we have barely even begun to solve the crisis facing middle-class families struggling to pay their bills and stay in their homes. So we must move forward, quickly and aggressively, with a middle-class rescue plan that will create jobs, provide relief to families, help homeowners and restore our financial system," said Senator Barack Obama.
