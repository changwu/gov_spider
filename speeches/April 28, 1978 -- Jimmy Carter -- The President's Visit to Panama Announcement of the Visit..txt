    President Carter has accepted an invitation from Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos to visit Panama. In consultations with Panama, the dates of June 16 and 17 have been set for the visit.
The principal purpose of the visit is to sign the protocol confirming the exchange of the documents ratifying the Panama Canal treaties. Pursuant to a reservation adopted by the Senate, the effective date of this exchange will be March 31, 1979, unless Congress passes implementing legislation at an earlier date.
The details of the President's schedule are being worked out with the Government of Panama.
