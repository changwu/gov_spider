    I commend House and Senate negotiators for their hard work and success in ensuring that the Congress has a budget resolution in place that reflects my priorities of winning the war against terrorism, protecting Americans at home, and strengthening economic growth. I particularly congratulate Chairmen Nickles and Nussle for their leadership, not only in accomplishing agreement but in doing so ahead of schedule. The compromise budget resolution funds our priorities, restrains spending, and provides opportunity for passage of a robust jobs-and-growth package. I commend the House for passing this measure and look forward to prompt passage in the Senate.
