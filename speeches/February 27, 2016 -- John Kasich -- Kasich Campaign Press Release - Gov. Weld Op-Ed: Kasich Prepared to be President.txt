Remember that it was Kasich who talked Congress and Bill Clinton into not only balancing the federal budget, but into ending welfare as it had existed for decades.
Kasich is as upset and angry as other Republicans about what's happening to our nation, and our failure to solve our major problems. But Kasich does not give in to the temptation to use vicious rhetoric, because he has the seasoning and the wisdom to know that once you're elected, campaigning that way makes progress after the election far more difficult.
