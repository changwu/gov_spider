    SANTA FE, NM-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson yesterday signed the AARP's Divided We Fail pledge in Davenport, Iowa, promising that every American will have access to high quality, affordable health care when he is President.
"I have spent my entire career bringing people together to get things done," Governor Richardson said. "I agree with the AARP that if we are divided as a nation, we will fail to deliver high quality, affordable health care to every American. I am proud to have signed the Divided We Fail pledge. I was one of the first candidates in the Presidential race to come out with a comprehensive plan for universal health care."
Richardson released his health care plan on August 7th in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The plan includes a mandate for every individual to obtain coverage as well as a sliding tax credit to ensure that every American can afford quality coverage. It builds on existing programs to expand coverage options, creating choices rather than new bureaucracy, and it emphasizes prevention.
