    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards for President campaign manager Congressman David Bonior released the following statement:
"This morning we all read in the Los Angeles Times that many Clinton campaign contributions are raising eyebrows again. Many of their donors are not even registered to vote, and at least one denied even making any contribution at all.
"In order to win in 2008, Democrats need to select a nominee who knows the system in Washington is not only broken, but it's corrupt. This is not a purity contest - it's not about what we've done yesterday. This is about what each of us can do today to fix the system. Senator Clinton has said public financing is the answer. Senator Edwards has opted to take public financing, but Senator Clinton has not. Senator Clinton should explain why she doesn't mean what she says.
"The bottom line is we need a nominee who can do two things: campaign in all 50 states and challenge our broken system in Washington. With every day the growing question has to be can Hillary Clinton do either?"
