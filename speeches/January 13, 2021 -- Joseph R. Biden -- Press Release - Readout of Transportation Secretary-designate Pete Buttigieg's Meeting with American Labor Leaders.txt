    Secretary of Transportation-designate Pete Buttigieg met virtually today with leaders of the American labor movement to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on America's workers and how the Department of Transportation (DOT) can work in partnership with unions to keep workers safe and build our economy back better from the pandemic. Secretary-designate Buttigieg relayed his deep appreciation for these leaders and the workers they represent for the sacrifices they're making to keep our country running during these challenging times.
Secretary-designate Buttigieg and the labor leaders discussed the urgent need to leverage the DOT's power to quickly improve the lives of workers, putting in place strong protections for transport workers and all workers on the job from COVID-19 and other safety hazards.
The group also discussed how crucial it is to partner with each other on funding our roads, bridges, and various forms of transportation and the need for a robust infrastructure package. Secretary-designate Buttigieg talked about how investing in our infrastructure and our workers is an enormous opportunity to lead the world. He reiterated the Biden-Harris administration's goals for DOT, including safe transportation, creating millions of good paying jobs at home, fighting for equity in transportation policy and taking on climate change.
The labor leaders expressed their congratulations to Secretary-designate Buttigieg and their eagerness to work together. Secretary-designate Buttigieg and the labor leaders agreed to continue their conversations and work together to benefit American workers and make the necessary investments in American transportation and infrastructure.
