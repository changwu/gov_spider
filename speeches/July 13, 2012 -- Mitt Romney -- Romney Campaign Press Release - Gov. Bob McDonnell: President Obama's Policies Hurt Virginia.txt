SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN: "You're holding a press conference later today, a 'Welcome President Obama to Virginia' press conference."
GOV. BOB MCDONNELL: "I am. Yeah."
O'BRIEN: "Why? I know something is up when you're doing that, clearly."
MCDONNELL: "That's pretty sneaky you figured that out. We're always glad to have the Commander-in-Chief here in Virginia. But there are some stark contrasts between what he stands for and Mitt Romney and we're going to talk about those, particularly, Soledad, on jobs and energy. Because when I look at what's hurt my state over the last couple of years with this President's policies that have been over burdensome—to a person—the energy industry—and we're trying to be the energy capital of the east coast— is saying these policies, the EPA policies and this anti-business, anti-energy growth and the traditional energy sources is hurting our state. I want people to know about it. And the entrepreneurs and small business people are also very concerned about the policies that he's got. So we're going to talk about that and I want people to know that Mitt Romney is the best guy for business."
