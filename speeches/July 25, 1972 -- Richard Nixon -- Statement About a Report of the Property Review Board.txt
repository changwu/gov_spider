    MEMBERS of the Property Review Board reported to me today on major new initiatives that are underway to improve the management of Federal real property. I am especially pleased to note the progress under the Legacy of Parks program which has now reached 39 States, leading to the creation of 144 new parks.
The Federal public lands belong to all Americans and are part of the heritage and birthright of every citizen. They are the breathing space of the Nation, and it is essential that they be preserved for future generations.
Government must work as the trustee for the future to ensure that the environmental, ecological, and recreational values of these lands will be safeguarded. Our goal, the goal of the Property Review Board--to manage our public lands wisely and well to best serve the greatest number has resulted in more parks and recreational opportunities for all Americans.
By returning federally owned land to States and localities to fill locally determined needs, the Property Management Program administered by the Board is reversing the trend of the past decade towards government so big it loses touch with its citizens.
The program is a creative avenue for Federal, State, and local cooperation in achieving two of this Administration's principal domestic aims--bringing government closer to the people and improving our environment.
