Ellen Mayberry has been taking a drug that helps her cope with crippling migraines for more than 30 years. Over the past decade, the retail price of that drug has increased—not just a little bit, but by thousands of dollars.
When Hillary Clinton came to Iowa, Ellen saw a chance to share her story with someone who might actually be able to help. She handed Hillary a letter before her speech and hoped that Hillary would have a chance to read it at some point.
To Ellen's surprise, Hillary began reading the letter right then and there.?

After reading Ellen's letter, Hilary was shocked—and angry. So she got up on stage and read Ellen's letter to the crowd and explained what she was going to do about it.





This isn't Hillary's first time going toe-to-toe with pharmaceutical companies. She took them on in the 1990s during the fight for health care reform, and she has called out price-gouging CEOs on the campaign trail. As president, she'll do more to bring down out-of-pocket health care costs—and stand up to anyone who tries to stand in the way of hardworking Americans and the care they need.

Predatory pharmaceutical companies, take note.?
