    To President Eamon de Valera:
I want to thank you for a visit that has been one of the most moving experiences of my life. Your gracious wife taught me the Irish word for welcome, "failte." I did not know "failte" could mean as much as you and the Irish people have made it mean for me during the past four days. I will have the memory of this wonderful Irish welcome in my heart always.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
To Taoiseach Sean F. Lemass:
I would like through you, Mr. Lemass, to thank all of the Irish people who have made my visit such a memorable one. The wonderful hospitality I have been showered with has indeed made me feel that I had "come home."
Meeting so many of the Irish people and their leaders was particularly enjoyable and I have been gratified by their sympathetic understanding of the problems which we in the West face.
I should like you to know how much I have enjoyed the personal exchange of views and ideas I have had with you. From the bottom of my heart, God bless Ireland.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
