    President Bush met for approximately 30 minutes this morning with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The President expressed his understanding for the difficulties Hungary faces in transforming the Hungarian economy and pledged America's continuing strong support. He said that Hungary and the United States will work together to assure that Hungarian democracy succeeds.
The two leaders talked about ways to expand U.S. trade and investment in Hungary. Toward that end, a team of U.S. experts is visiting Budapest this week to review with Hungarian officials impediments to expanded trade and possible ways of overcoming them. This is part of our effort to assure the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe the widest possible access to U.S. and European markets, which we expect will be a major theme of the G - 7 summit. President Goncz expressed his gratitude for U.S. understanding and support. In this context, the two Presidents also agreed on the importance for the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round.
The two leaders also discussed nationalities conflicts in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as transformations in the Soviet Union.
