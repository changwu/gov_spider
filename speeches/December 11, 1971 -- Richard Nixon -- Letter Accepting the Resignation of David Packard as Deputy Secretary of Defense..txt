    Dear Dave:
It is with the deepest regret that I accept your resignation, as you have requested, as Deputy Secretary of Defense, effective December 13, 1971.
Few men have given so much and so willingly to their country as you have for the past thirty-five months--and few have discharged their responsibilities with such distinction and excellence. In assuming this demanding position--at great personal and financial sacrifice--you demonstrated once again your commitment to effective public service and gave testimony to your belief that every American can and should contribute to the cause of good government.
Managing a vast array of exceedingly complex defense matters, you have shown outstanding judgment and uncommon ability, and have justly won the admiration and respect of your colleagues. Your wise counsel in vitally important national security questions has been of immense value to Mel Laird and to me, and I want you to know that these exceptional accomplishments have earned for you the Nation's gratitude.
As you return to private life, I am sure that each and every one of your many friends and associates here would want to join me in thanking you for a job superbly done and in wishing Lucile and you the happiness you so richly deserve.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable David Packard, The Deputy Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C. 20301]
