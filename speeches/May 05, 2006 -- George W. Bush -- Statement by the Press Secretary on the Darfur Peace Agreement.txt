    The United States welcomes the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Government of National Unity and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) led by Mini Menawi, the largest rebel force in Darfur. This agreement is a significant step in a long process to bring peace to all the people of Darfur. We urge Khalil Ibrahim of the Justice and Equality Movement and Abdul Wahid Nur of the SLM to join the peace process.
The United States congratulates President Obasanjo of Nigeria; President Sassou-Nguesso, Chairman of the African Union; and Salim Salim, African Union Special Envoy for the Darfur Talks and African Union Chief Mediator, for their commitment to peace and facilitation of the agreement. The United States and the international community were united in pressing the parties to accept this peace agreement. We will remain united in ensuring that it is fully implemented.
The United States fully supports this agreement to end the conflict and suffering in Darfur. This is an important day for the people of Darfur.
