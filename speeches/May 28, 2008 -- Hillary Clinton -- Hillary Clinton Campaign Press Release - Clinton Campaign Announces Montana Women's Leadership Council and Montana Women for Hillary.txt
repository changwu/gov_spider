    Nearly 800 women across the Big Sky State lend their support to Hillary for President
In a demonstration of the continuing support Senator Clinton continues to earn from all corners of the Big Sky State, the Montana for Hillary campaign today unveiled its Montana Women for Hillary Leadership Council and the names of nearly 800 Montana Women for Hillary. The announcement comes as women across Montana, including actress Erika Alexander, participate in a statewide Women's Day of Action.
"I am proud to stand with hundreds of other women across Montana in supporting Hillary for President," said Red Lodge Mayor Betsy Scanlin. "Not only is Hillary the most experienced candidate, I believe she is also the most electable candidate."
The complete list of Montana Women for Hillary is available upon request.
