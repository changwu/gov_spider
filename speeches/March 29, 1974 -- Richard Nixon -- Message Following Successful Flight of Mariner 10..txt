    THE SUCCESSFUL flight of Mariner 10 to the planet Mercury marks another historic milestone in America's continuing exploration of the solar system. With this mission we will begin to end centuries of speculation about our planetary neighbor closest to the Sun.
On behalf of all Americans, I extend warmest congratulations to NASA and the Mariner 10 team on their outstanding performance. The hard work, skill, and ingenuity that contributed to the success of Mariner 10 is in keeping with that historical tradition which began when men landed at Plymouth Rock and has continued through the landing of men on the Moon.
