    For far too long, our country's soldiers have served bravely overseas but are ignored when they return. A new campaign ad to begin airing today in Texas makes clear that Hillary Clinton gives a voice to our nation's service members, fighting to expand access to health care for the National Guard and pushing to protect bonuses of wounded soldiers.
Hillary has a long history of fighting for veterans, including working to help service members struggling with post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and increasing military survivor benefits. Hillary is committed to ensuring our country fulfills its obligations to those who have served and sacrificed for the nation.

Watch the 30-second spot, entitled "Voice Soldiers."
Following is the script for the ad.
Hillary For President
"Voice Soldiers"
TV: 30
Announcer: For every soldier who serves so bravely over there but is ignored over here, she hears you.
For every National Guard and Reservist who leaves their family behind, she hears you.
That's why Hillary Clinton reached across the aisle, to expand access to health care for the National Guard, and is pushing to protect the bonuses of wounded soldiers.
She'll never stop fighting for those who fight for us and give voice to those who have none.
Hillary Clinton: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
