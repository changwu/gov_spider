    As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, a grateful nation remembers all of the brave Americans who served in World War II.
In the spring of 1945, after almost six years of fighting, the war in Europe came to a dramatic close. As word of German General Jodl's surrender in Reims spread around the globe, celebrations broke out from New York and London to Paris and Moscow. Still, celebrations were tempered as President Truman reminded a worldwide radio audience that the war was not yet won. Many thousands more were yet to die fighting for the principles we hold so dear.
Half a century later, as Americans gather to mark the triumph over fascism and tyranny in Europe, we remember all those who fought to preserve our liberty. We honor our distinguished veterans—those who came home and those who did not return. We also honor their families— those who contributed to the battlefield victory through their efforts and prayers on the home front. These valiant men and women toiled to support and defend the cause of freedom fifty years ago, and they succeeded in preserving its blessings for generations to come. On behalf of Americans everywhere, I salute these heroes. They have our eternal gratitude.
Best wishes to all for a memorable observance.
BILL CLINTON
