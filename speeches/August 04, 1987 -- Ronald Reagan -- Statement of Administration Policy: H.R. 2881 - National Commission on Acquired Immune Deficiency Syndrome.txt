    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rowland (D) Georgia and 30 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2881 as unnecessary, since the President has already established a Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic in Executive Order 12601. This Commission has a mission that closely parallels that of the Commission proposed in H.R. 2881.
Moreover, the role established for the Veterans Administration (VA) in the bill as the lead agency for the Commission's work is out of proportion to the more specialized mission of the VA.
