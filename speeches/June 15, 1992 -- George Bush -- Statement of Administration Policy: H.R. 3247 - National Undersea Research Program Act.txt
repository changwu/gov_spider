    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/16/92)(House Rules)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 5 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3247.
The bill would authorize $150 million for FYs 1992-1996 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assist in undersea research. NOAA has administered the National Undersea Research Program since 1980, and many of the procedures prescribed by H.R. 3247 are presently in place. Statutory establishment of the program is unnecessary. Further, the program-growth authorized by the bill would place higher priority NOAA programs at risk in the appropriations process.
A number of additional provisions of H.R. 3247 are problematic. Section 106 provides for the designation of new undersea research regions and the establishment of new research centers, but provides no limit on the amount of expansion. Sections 201 and 202 would establish new undersea research regions in the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions, in direct opposition to the scientific requirements of Section 106.
