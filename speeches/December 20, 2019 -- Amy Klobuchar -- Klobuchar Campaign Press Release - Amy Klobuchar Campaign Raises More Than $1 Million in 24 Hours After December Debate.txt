    MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€” Tonight the Amy for America campaign announced that it received more than $1 million in the 24 hours following the sixth Democratic presidential debate in California. The campaign surged in online support with more than 5,500 new website signups and received contributions from thousands of grassroots donors after Amy's winning performance.
"On last night's debate stage, Amy Klobuchar proved that she is the candidate who can take on Donald Trump and help Democrats win big up and down the ballot," said Amy for America Campaign Manager Justin Buoen. "Her message is resonating with Americans who are looking for a President who can bring people together and deliver real results. In the 24 hours following the debate, we have raised more than $1 million, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses. We will continue to build a strong grassroots operation to win in the primary and take on Donald Trump in the general."
Today, Klobuchar kicked off her For All of America bus tour which includes stops in 27 counties across Iowa in four days. With the release of the DNC debate qualifications this morning, Klobuchar is one of five candidates qualified for the seventh Democratic presidential debate in January.
