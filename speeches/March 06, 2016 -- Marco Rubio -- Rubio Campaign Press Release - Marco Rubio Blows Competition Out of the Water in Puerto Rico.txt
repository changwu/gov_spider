It's the first time any Republican so far this year has won more than half the vote in a primary or caucus.

In addition to the 23 delegates won thanks to Marco's huge margin, a couple other points stand out:
Marco's win is partly attributable to the positive set of solutions he's set out for how to help Puerto Rico out of its current economic crisis, relying on free-market reforms rather than more help from Washington.
And his blow-out win bodes well for the March 15 primary in Florida, too: The state is home to many Puerto Ricans.
