    To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.J. Res. 748, continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1987 for two more days until the Congress can agree on a full year budget.
The Congress has been informed of the Administration's position on a Continuing Resolution, including provisions that warrant my veto. As I had previously made clear, the provision included in this resolution providing for the rehire of air traffic controllers who engaged in the 1981 strike is totally unacceptable. I cannot accept this and certain other provisions included in this measure.
The Administration will continue to work closely with the Congress to reach agreement on an acceptable full-year Continuing Resolution. The Congress has had over eight months to do its job, and complete action on FY 1987 appropriations. The time for action is long past due.
