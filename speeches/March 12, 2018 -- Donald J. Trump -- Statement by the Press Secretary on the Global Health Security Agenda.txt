    Today, the White House is releasing a report, "Implementing the Global Health Security Agenda: Progress and Impact from U.S. Government Investments," that clearly shows how the investments made by taxpayers to improve global health security are paying dividends.
Over the past year, the Trump Administration has strongly championed the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which helps build health security capacity around the world to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate.
As President Trump has said, "We cannot have prosperity if we are not healthy." The report details how GHSA support enabled countries to respond to and contain outbreaks of high-threat diseases, including dengue fever in Burkina Faso and the Marburg virus in Uganda.
The United States Government remains a strong supporter of GHSA and continues to demonstrate leadership through our engagement in multilateral efforts and bilateral capacity building programs. The Fiscal Year 2019 President's Budget proposes additional resources for GHSA, and emphasizes the importance of strengthening countries' ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.
