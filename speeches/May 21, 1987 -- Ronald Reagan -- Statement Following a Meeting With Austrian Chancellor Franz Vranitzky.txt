    Austrian Chancellor Vranitzky and I have had a very good meeting. We talked over a set of international issues, including arms reductions and cooperation against terrorism. Chancellor Vranitzky explained to me the reaction of the Austrian Government and public to the U.S. Government's decision on Mr. Waldheim. I explained to the Chancellor the statutory basis for the decision. I also assured the Chancellor that the United States and Austria will remain close friends. We both share a strong commitment to human rights and democracy. I also told the Chancellor that Austria has every reason to be proud of its record since World War II. Its many achievements include assisting thousands of refugees fleeing political and religious persecution and providing a haven for emigrating Soviet Jews. Austria has also actively worked toward creating a more peaceful world. Austrian soldiers are helping U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Cyprus and in the Golan Heights. Both of us agreed at the conclusion of our meeting to work together to strengthen further the strong ties of friendship that exist between our two nations.
