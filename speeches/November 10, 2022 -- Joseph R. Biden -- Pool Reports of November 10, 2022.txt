"I plan on doing whatever he wants me to do for him."
Re can Dems still keep the House?
"It's still alive. It's still alive. But it's like drawing an inside straight."
Re his comment yesterday about how he would work, under the Constitution, to keep Trump from returning to the White House:
"I said that respecting institutions matters. One of the things that I know you all (inaudible) my talking about is whether or not we had, in America, a land that was consistent with our institutions. And I talked about whether or not there was going to be any shenanigans in the way in which we did our elections. And I notice that all of you are talking about that now."
That's all.
