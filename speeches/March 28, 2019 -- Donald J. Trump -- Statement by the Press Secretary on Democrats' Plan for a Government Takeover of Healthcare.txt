    Obamacare is a total disaster and Democrats know it. They sold Obamacare on lies and empty promises, and after years of implementation, it has completely failed the American people – costs exploded, options vanished, and patients suffered. Unfortunately, the Democrats' radical idea would force a complete and total government takeover of the healthcare system. This socialist agenda would result in 180 Million Americans losing their healthcare coverage and, in particular, would drastically hurt seniors.
President Donald J. Trump has been clear, Republicans will become "The Party of Healthcare."
Since the President took office, the Administration has addressed many of the problems with Obamacare by lowering the costs of prescription drugs for the first time in 46 years and opening up newer, more affordable health insurance options for middle-class American families and small businesses. But the fight is just beginning. We will protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower prices for care and prescription drugs even further, end surprise medical bills, and make sure Americans get the absolute best quality of care. Our Nation deserves a great healthcare system that puts American patients first and puts people – not the government – in control of their healthcare.
