Former Georgia U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn threw his support behind Rex Tillerson on Wednesday, telling senators that Donald Trump's Secretary of State nominee is "well prepared to do what is essential for the security of our nation."

"I consider Rex Tillerson's experience and knowledge in business as an asset – not a liability," Nunn said, addressing the biggest criticism lobbed at the nominee.
"I know Rex Tillerson pretty well, and I am confident that he is well prepared to do what is essential for the security of our nation: to hold firm and tough where our national interests and our values demand it and to build on our common interests in working with other nations – including Russia – on practical, concrete steps that will make the American people safer and more secure," he added.
The four-term Senate Democrat joined Texas' two senators and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates to perform the ceremonial duty of introducing the former ExxonMobil CEO during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
