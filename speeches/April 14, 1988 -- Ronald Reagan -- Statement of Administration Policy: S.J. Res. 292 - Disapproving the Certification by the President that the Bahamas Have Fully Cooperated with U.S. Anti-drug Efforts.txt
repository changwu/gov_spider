    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Pell (D) Rhode Island)
The Administration opposes S.J. Res. 292 and, if it is presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend a veto. On February 28, 1988, the President certified that certain major narcotics producing and/or major narcotics transit countries, including the Bahamas, have cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own to control narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering.
The Administration carefully and thoroughly reviewed all aspects of this certification. The certification in February was based on the conclusion that, on balance, our fight against drugs will be more effective if we do not interrupt or jeopardize joint U.S.-Bahamian efforts. The Bahamas have taken steps to further enhance drug enforcement. We are working with the Bahamas to assure that progress continues. Because decertification would require the United States to vote against future loans requested by the Bahamas from international development banks, this would result in severe economic consequences for the Bahamas. Damaging the Bahamas' economy would be counterproductive.
