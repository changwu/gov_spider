    RATES OF PAY AND ALLOWANCES
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, and in accord with Section 101 (c) of Public Law 96-86 approved October 12, 1979, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1-101. In order to provide notice of the effect of appropriations limitations on the payable rates of salary and basic pay, additional footnotes are added to each of the pay schedules attached to Executive Order No. 12165 of October 9, 1979.
1-102. In order to preserve existing comparability in new Senior Executive Service positions for purposes of applying the recent appropriations limitations, comparable pay levels are designated in an additional footnote to Schedule 4 attached to Executive Order No. 12165.
1-103. Schedules 1 through 7 attached to Executive Order No. 12165 are amended by substituting therefor the revised Schedules 1 through 7 which are attached hereto and made a part hereof. These new schedules are identical to the original schedules except for the addition of asterisks and new footnotes which reflect new maximum limitations on payable rates of salary and basic pay. The scheduled rates of pay and allowances have not been altered. These new schedules therefore supersede the original schedules.
1-104. To make a technical correction, the statutory reference "89 Stat. 419, 28 U.S.C. 461" in the first clause of Section 1-103 of Executive Order No. 12165 is amended to read "Public Law 94-82, 89 Stat. 419".
1-105. (a) Section 1-103 of Executive Order No. 12165 is further amended by adding a new subsection (c) as follows:
"(c) Judicial Salaries (28 U.S.C. 5, 44(d), 135, 173, 213, 252, 792(b) and 11 U.S.C. 68(a) and Sections 401(a), 404 (a), 404(b), and 404(d) of Public Law 95-598) at Schedule 8.".
(b) Schedules 1 through 7 of Executive Order No. 12165 are further amended by adding thereto a new Schedule 8, setting forth Judicial Salaries, which is attached hereto and made a part hereof.
