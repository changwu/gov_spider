The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published its Cloud Smart Strategy proposal. This is the first cloud policy update in seven years offering a path forward for agencies to migrate to a safe and secure cloud network. This new strategy will support agencies to achieve additional savings, security, and will deliver faster services.
"To keep up with the country's current pace of innovation, President Trump has placed a significant emphasis on modernizing the Federal government," stated Suzette Kent, Federal Chief Information Officer. "By updating an outdated policy, Cloud Smart embraces best practices from both the federal government and the private sector, ensuring agencies have capability to leverage leading solutions to better serve agency mission, drive improved citizen services and increase cyber security."
