    LAS VEGAS, NV -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Washington Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Washington's veterans' community.
"John McCain knows that as Americans, we are tremendously blessed with historic freedoms and liberties," said Capt. Doug Roulstone, USN (Ret.). "Our freedoms have been secured and shared around the world through the brave actions of our servicemen and women. Due to their actions, John McCain has fought tirelessly to make the VA work for our veterans during his tenure in the Senate."
Col. Bob Lawrence, USAF (Ret.), added, "Barack Obama talks about his record of supporting the troops, but when presented with the choice between supporting our military men and women or advancing the most liberal voting record in the Senate, Obama chooses the latter. John McCain is the right candidate to lead our country during these difficult times because he understands that partisan politics should not be played with our brave men and women serving overseas, and he knows that our country's interest must come first."
McCain's campaign announced the leadership of Washington Veterans for John McCain today at a press event in Seattle that featured veterans from across the state and all branches of the military. Supporters from all age groups and military backgrounds filled the Remembrance Garden to show their support for John McCain.
