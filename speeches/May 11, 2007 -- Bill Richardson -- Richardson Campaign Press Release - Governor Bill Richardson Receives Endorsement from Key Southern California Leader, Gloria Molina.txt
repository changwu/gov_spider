    Influential LA County Supervisor calls Governor Richardson "Clearly the most qualified candidate"
LOS ANGELES, CA - New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today received the endorsement of Gloria Molina, a Los Angeles County Supervisor and one of the most influential political leaders in Southern California. Mrs. Molina announced her support of Governor Richardson following a town hall meeting in Monterey Park, CA with more than 200 of her constituents, local leaders, and business people.
"Governor Richardson is one of the most effective and responsive leaders I have ever worked with," said Supervisor Molina. "His experience is what sets him apart from the crowded field of Presidential candidates. I believe he is the right man at the right time to be the next President of the United States."
In 1991 Mrs. Molina became the first Latina elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. She has been a local and national leader on a wide variety of important issues, working to support families and children, transportation projects, urban revitalization, education, and many quality of life projects, to name just a few of her many areas of accomplishment.
"I am honored to receive this important endorsement. I have known Gloria for many years and admire what she has been able to get done for the people of her district, for California, and for Latinos across the country," said Governor Richardson.
