    It is long past time that we correct several injustices in the immigration system by changing the registry date and amending the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). People who have been living for many years in the United States and have developed strong ties to their communities deserve the opportunity to normalize their immigration status. There is no reason for Congress to stand in the way of a reasonable bipartisan bill to increase H-1B visas, invest in our workers, and correct these longstanding injustices. Congress should not pass H-1B or any other immigration legislation this year without ensuring that these injustices are addressed. The American people deserve no less.
