    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Inouye (D) Hawaii)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of S.J. Res. 23. However, the Administration continues to have concerns with the requirement for Federal consent to State amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. This Act affects only State lands, so no Federal involvement should be necessary. The Administration recommends that the Hawaiian Statehood Act be amended to delete this consent requirement.
