Boston, MA – Today, Governor Romney announced the endorsement of eight Montana Legislators who will form the Montana Romney for President Legislative Leadership Team. This team will help build Governor Romney's grassroots organization in the state and help campaign for his message of strengthening the economy and brining real conservative change to Washington.
"These legislators share in my optimistic vision to strengthen our economy," said Governor Romney. "I look forward to working with them to bring real conservative change to this country. Together, we know that Montana and this nation will be stronger if we cut wasteful government spending, reduce the tax burden on businesses and middle income families and secure the border."
"Governor Romney is the only Republican candidate with the proven record and leadership to turn around Washington," said State House Speaker Pro Tempore Debby Barrett. "He has proven he as the experience needed to do the job in the private sector, at the 2002 Winter Olympics and as Governor of Massachusetts. I would encourage every Montanan to join us in supporting this true conservative as our next president."
These legislators join previously announced Montana Romney for President State Co-Chairs former Governor Tim Babcock and Secretary of State Brad Johnson.
