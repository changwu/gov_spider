    To the Congress of the United States:
On March 30, 1984, in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, I issued Executive Order No. 12470 declaring a national emergency and continuing export regulations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). Under Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless I publish in the Federal Register and transmit to the Congress notice of its continuation.
I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the emergency concerning the continuation in effect of export regulations. Attached is a copy of the notice of extension.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
March 28, 1985.
