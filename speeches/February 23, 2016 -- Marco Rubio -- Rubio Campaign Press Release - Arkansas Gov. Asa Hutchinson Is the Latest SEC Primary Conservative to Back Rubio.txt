Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson is backing Marco, adding to a surging effort in the March 1st primary state.
I'm delighted to support @marcorubio because he is best choice to keep our country safe. Will you join me and help Marco win Arkansas?

Hutchinson's backing comes on the heels of a massive rally for Marco Sunday in Little Rock. Marcomentum is building in Arkansas!

Hutchinson was elected in 2014 by a landslide, reclaiming the Governor's office after 8 years under Democratic control.
He also previously served as Chairman of the NRA's "National School Shield Initiative" Taskforce and as a United States Attorney.
Governor Hutchinson, welcome to Team Marco!
