    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that military veterans from every county of New Hampshire have joined together in support of Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
The New Hampshire Veterans for Rudy coalition was announced during a phone banking event at the campaign's state headquarters Thursday evening, where coalition members made phone calls reaching out to fellow veterans and Republican voters. Veterans for Rudy will continue to build this coalition to help communicate Mayor Giuliani's optimistic vision for America and his proven track record of real results to New Hampshire voters.
"It's clear Mayor Giuliani understands that veterans have devoted their lives to defending our liberty," said the coalition's state chair, Major General (Ret.) Joseph K. Simeone, former Deputy Adjutant General for the New Hampshire National Guard. "Mayor Giuliani has a proven track record of accomplishments and executive experience as Mayor of New York City that will serve us well as President of the United States."
