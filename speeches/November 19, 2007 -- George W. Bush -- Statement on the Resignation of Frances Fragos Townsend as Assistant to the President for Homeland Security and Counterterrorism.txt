    Over the past 4 1/2 years, Fran Townsend has served my administration with distinction as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Fran has always provided wise counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of terrorism. She has been a steady leader in the effort to prevent and disrupt attacks and to better respond to natural disasters.
Fran's remarkable career as a public servant has spanned more than two decades. She has prosecuted violent crimes, narcotics offenses, mafia cases, and white collar fraud as an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn and as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan. During her career, Fran worked to protect the American people as the Counsel to the Attorney General for Intelligence Policy, the Assistant Commandant for Intelligence at the U.S. Coast Guard, and as the Deputy National Security Adviser for Combating Terrorism at the National Security Council.
With her extensive experience, intellect, and candor, Fran has ably guided the Homeland Security Council. She has played an integral role in the formation of the key strategies and policies my administration has used to combat terror and protect Americans. She has traveled the world to meet with allies in the global war on terror and has partnered extensively with first-responders at the State and local level to enhance our preparedness. We are safer today because of her leadership.
Laura and I wish Fran, her husband John, and their two sons James and Patrick, all the best.
