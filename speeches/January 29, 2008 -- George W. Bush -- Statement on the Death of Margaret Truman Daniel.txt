    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Margaret Truman Daniel. The only child of our 33d President, she supported her father as he confronted the difficult challenges of his Presidency, witnessing firsthand the leadership of Harry Truman in both war and peace. An accomplished author and singer, her life was one of tremendous personal achievement. Our thoughts and prayers are with Margaret Truman Daniel's sons and the rest of the Truman family.
