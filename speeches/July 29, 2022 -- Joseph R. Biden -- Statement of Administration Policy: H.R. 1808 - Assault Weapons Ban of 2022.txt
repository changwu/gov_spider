    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Cicilline, D-RI, and 212 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022. 40,000 Americans die from gunshot wounds every year and guns have become the top killer of children in the United States. As President Biden has repeatedly called for, we must do more to stop this gun violence and save lives.
We know an assault weapons and large-capacity magazine ban will save lives. In 1994, then- Senator Biden played a leading role in securing a ten-year ban on assault weapons and large- capacity magazines. For those ten years, mass shootings declined. When the ban expired in 2004, mass shootings tripled.
It is time for Congress to build on the momentum of enactment of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act by passing H.R. 1808 and banning these weapons of war.
