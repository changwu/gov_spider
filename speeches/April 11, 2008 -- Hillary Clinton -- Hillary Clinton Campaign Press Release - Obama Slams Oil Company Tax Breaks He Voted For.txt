    "Sen. Obama should be honest and tell Democrats that he voted for Dick Cheney's energy bill, which even his own supporters acknowledge contained billions of dollars in giveaways to the oil industry. We don't need another politician to talk about standing up to the oil industry, we need a fighter like Hillary Clinton who will actually do it." â€“ Clinton Deputy Communications Director Phil Singer.
Today in Indiana, Sen. Obama slammed oil company tax breaks and touted his legislation to repeal them:
Q: You know it's mind boggling to me to think that our oil companies are inheriting so much money and they're not even paying their taxes like honest Americans, so when you get into office are you going to cut the oil companies' tax breaks?
Sen. Obama: Yes. We've already, you know, I've already introduced legislation, or, or been a cosponsor of legislation to repeal some of these tax breaks to the oil companies...
Sen. Obama failed to mention that < a=href"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm...">he voted for these tax breaks in the 2005 energy bill. His bill, which he introduced just days before announcing his run for president, would "Repeal provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005," that he voted for.
One of his most prominent supporters in Pennsylvania, Sen. Bob Casey said of the bill "I think on the energy bill, I'll just tell you, when I was campaigning, I was very troubled by, in particular, the giveaways to energy interests."
