As set forth in the bipartisan accord on Central America, Republicans and Democrats share an interest in seeing a free and fair electoral process in Nicaragua to bring freedom and peace to that troubled country. The members of the Commission will travel to Nicaragua from now through the February election to monitor closely the degree to which the Nicaraguan Government is keeping its commitment to hold a free and fair election. The President expressed his hope that this Commission, as well as all other election-observer groups, will be welcomed by the Nicaraguan Government and receive its full cooperation.
