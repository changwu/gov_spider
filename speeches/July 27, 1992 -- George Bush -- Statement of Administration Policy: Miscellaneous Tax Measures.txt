This Statement addresses nine tax measures to be considered by the House on July 27th.

H.R. 5653 - High-Speed Rail Bonds (Coyne (D) Pennsylvania)
The Administration has no objection to the high-speed rail bonds provisions of H.R. 5653, as long as they are publically owned. However, the Administration does not support enactment of H.R. 5653 because the pay-as-you-go offset may impose significant burdens on State and local governments.

Pay-As-You-Go ScoringThe bills addressed in this Statement affect receipts and direct spending and therefore are subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. The table below includes the estimated total effect of all of these bills. A budget point of order applies in both the House and Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If, contrary to the Administration's recommendation, any such point of order that applies against one of these bills was waived, the effects of enactment of this legislation would be included in a look-back pay-as-you-go sequester report at the end of the congressional session.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of these bills are presented below. Final scoring of them may deviate from these estimates. If any of the bills is enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
