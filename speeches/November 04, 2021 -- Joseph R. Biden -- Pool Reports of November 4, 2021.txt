In-town pool report #1 
Hey everyone,
Lissa Villa from BuzzFeed News here, and I'm your in-town pooler for today.
Passing this along from a White House official:
"Yesterday, President Biden spoke to Mayor-elect Eric Adams, Governor Phil Murphy, and Congresswoman-elect Shontel Brown. He congratulated them on their victories this week and committed to continue working closely to build back better, grow jobs and the economy, and expand opportunities for working families across the country. They additionally spoke of the continued need to defeat COVID-19 and get Americans vaccinated. President Biden also spoke to Governor Terry McAuliffe and thanked him for a hard fought campaign, as well as his many years of service to both the Democratic Party and the United States of America."
