    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 3 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 2739, but will seek amendments in the Senate.
The Administration would prefer a simple one-year extension of the airport grant program and will seek that change in the Senate. The Administration strongly opposes, and will seek to eliminate, several provisions in the bill. These include provisions establishing a fixed term for the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and further restricting the amount of Trust Fund support for the FAA budget.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2739 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect over FYs 1994-1998 would be zero.
