    "After the dust settles, the fact remains Rudy Giuliani is the only Republican candidate with the conservative record of results voters can trust that doesn't change with the political wind. Rudy doesn't need on the job training; he has the executive experience and tested leadership our times call for. Rudy Giuliani is the real deal – an authentic, gutsy leader with an optimistic vision to keep our country moving forward."
