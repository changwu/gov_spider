    Clinton Campaign Policy Director, Neera Tanden, made the following statement today:
"We won't take lectures on the right way to approach the Constitution from Senator McCain, who voted for extreme conservative judges like Justice Thomas. In an effort to pander to conservative voters, Senator McCain has signaled his intention to appoint right-wing judges who are committed to rolling back women's rights and civil rights, elevating the interests of big business over the rights of workers and consumers, affirming executive branch power grabs, and undermining our common core freedoms. Senator Clinton has a different vision. She will appoint judges who respect the separation of powers, are steadfast in protecting civil rights and liberties, including the right of privacy, and who cherish equal justice under law."
