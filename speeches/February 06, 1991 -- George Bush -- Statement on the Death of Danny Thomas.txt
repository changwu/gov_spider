    The death of Danny Thomas leaves a noticeable void in the world of American humor. We also lose a fine gentleman and humanitarian who will always be known as a man of good will.
Danny Thomas entertained Presidents from Eisenhower to the present. He was a giant of the entertainment business who knew that spark of delight which Americans take in poking fun at themselves. In his situation comedies, either as actor or producer, he reflected the best qualities of American life. He pioneered the family sitcom in which we could all use the new medium of television to laugh at ourselves and our daily problems. We will be laughing with him for years to come.
In 1962, Danny Thomas founded St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, TN. It became more than a leading research center dedicated to finding cures for children's cancer and other diseases, but a symbol of the love that one man had for his fellow man. That was Danny Thomas.
Barbara and I extend our deepest sympathies to Rose Marie, the Thomas family, and all of Danny's friends.
