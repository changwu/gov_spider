    The United States welcomes Bahrain's first parliamentary elections in nearly 30 years. Bahrain is a close friend and an important example of a nation making the transition to democracy.
The national elections recently concluded promise to strengthen the establishment of representative institutions in Bahrain and to help meet the political aspirations of all its citizens, including women who fully participated in the electoral process.
I strongly support the efforts that King Hamad and the people of Bahrain have undertaken to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law. The United States will continue to support Bahrain as it pursues these goals.
