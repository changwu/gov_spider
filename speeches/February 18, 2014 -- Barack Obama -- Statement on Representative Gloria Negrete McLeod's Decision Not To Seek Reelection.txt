    Gloria Negrete McLeod has been a strong advocate for hard-working families and farmers in California's 35th District and across the country. She has been a key partner in promoting access to affordable health care and bringing quality employment and higher education opportunities to all Americans. Gloria has consistently supported working women and their families and has championed programs to help our Nation's veterans find jobs and enroll in college. Michelle and I thank Congresswoman Negrete McLeod for her service and send her, her husband Gilbert, and their family our warmest regards.
