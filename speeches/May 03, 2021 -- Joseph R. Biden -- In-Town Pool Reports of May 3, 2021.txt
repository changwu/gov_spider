Print pool report #1 
Good morning,
It’s a dreary, cloudy day here at the White House but no rainfall since sunrise.
I’ll be your in-town print pooler for today. I’ve been COVID tested.
The president and first lady are traveling to Yorktown and Norfolk, Virginia today to sell the American Families Plan and the American Jobs Plan. The first couple will visit a Yorktown elementary school and Tidewater Community College, where POTUS is and FLOTUS are scheduled to deliver remarks at 1:30 p.m.
Pool is slated to gather at 8:20 a.m. for the 8:40 p.m. departure and then will hand the baton off to the out-of-town travel pool until the return, scheduled for 4 p.m.

In-town print pool report # 2
POTUS and FLOTUS emerged from the motorcade at 8:55 am. POTUS, clad in a navy blue suit, ushered FLOTUS out of the car, and swiftly climbed aboard Marine One.
POTUS did not turn toward the press and did not respond to a shouted question about whether he is concerned the US will not reach herd immunity any time soon. It could not be heard above the din of Marine One.
Marine One lifted off at 9 am.
I’ll follow up with the aides accompanying him in a subsequent pool report if I can get a list.

In-town print pool report #3 - early return
Pool is gathered at the ellipse for an earlier than expected POTUS and FLOTUS return.
The first couple is expected to arrive 20 mins early at ~4:40 pm.

In-town print pool report #4 - actual return
Marine One touched down back at the ellipse at 3:44 pm. POTUS and FLOTUS emerged, POTUS grabbed FLOTUS’ hand, gave a slight wave with folder in hand, and the two made a bee-line to the motorcade. Motorcade took off back to the White House at 3:47 pm.
POTUS ignored shouted questions on reports of potential US-Iran hostage swap and one on whether he is comfortable with his grandchildren getting vaccinated.
Correction to previous print pool report - the first couple was expected early at 3:40 pm, not 4:40 as I wrote.

And at 3:50 pm we have a lid.
Have a great afternoon, everyone!
