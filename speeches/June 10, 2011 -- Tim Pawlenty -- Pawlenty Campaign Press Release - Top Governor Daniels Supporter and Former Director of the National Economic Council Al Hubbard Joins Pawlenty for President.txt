    Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign announced today that top Gov. Daniels supporter and former director of the National Economic Council Al Hubbard will chair Pawlenty for President's policy efforts.
"Tim Pawlenty's positive vision for America is exactly what our nation needs to get back on the right track," Hubbard said. "Gov. Pawlenty is ready to tackle the tough economic hurdles we face as a nation. While others seem to accept the status quo, Pawlenty recognizes that there are viable solutions to turning our economy around. Gov. Pawlenty is committed to meeting our fiscal challenges by reducing the deficit and cutting spending. Pawlenty knows there is a path to expansive growth, and because of this I believe that he is the right man to lead us toward a brighter future."
"Al Hubbard not only has clout with the vast network of Gov. Daniels' supporters, but also carries weight with policy makers and thought leaders nationally," Pawlenty said. "His addition to our team adds even more momentum to my campaign that is focused on offering honest solutions to the challenges facing America."
