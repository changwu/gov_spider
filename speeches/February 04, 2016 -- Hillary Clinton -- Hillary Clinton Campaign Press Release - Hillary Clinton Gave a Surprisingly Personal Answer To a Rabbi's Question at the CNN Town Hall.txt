During a CNN town hall, Rabbi?Jonathan Spira-Savett asked Hillary Clinton how she balances the?ambition it takes to run for president and the humility that it requires to live a life of service.
As a person of faith, Hillary has been asking herself this question for a long time.


She told the rabbi that her faith compelled her to a career in politics: She is running for president because she believes in doing the most good for the most people. And she is reminded of that at the beginning of every day.


Hillary also revealed the piece of scripture that she turns to most often during difficult times.
"I read a treatment of the Prodigal Son parable," she said. "There was a line in it that became a lifeline for me."?


She spends each day working to practice that discipline.
