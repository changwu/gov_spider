    To the Congress of the United States:
On the 15th ultimo all the buildings of the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, excepting the heating plant and lighting apparatus, were destroyed by fire.
I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, which states the fact and explains the need of rebuilding.
In order that there may be no delay in this important work, I recommend that an appropriation be made at once of $600,000, the sum estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury as required for this purpose.
