    Manchester, N.H. -- Governor Scott Walker today released a new web video highlighting the contrast between his bold plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare with a solution that gives all Americans freedom over their health care decisions and Hillary Clinton's broken promises in defense of the failed law.

As Walker says, "Like I did in my state, I'm going to tell you I'm willing to stand up against anyone, including members of my own party, to get the job done. A lot of candidates talk about repealing Obamacare, we've actually got a plan to make sure Congress acts because they're going to have to live under the same rules as everyone else in America."
"We want affordable and accessible health insurance, for everyone in America. We want to make sure that truly needy people get the care that they need. We need to send that power and responsibility back to the states, where states can be more innovative and are more likely to get the job done. Americans want more than just campaign promises, they want results."
