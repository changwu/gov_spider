    Gov. Kasich's twin daughters Emma & Reese joined him on the campaign trail in Virginia this week. They also made a stop at the U.S. Capitol building, where Gov. Kasich served in Congress for 18 years. Here is what Emma wrote from the road:
My sister and I loved going on the campaign trail with our dad! It was amazing to see all the people at the town halls supporting him and ready to go tell everyone they knew about him. Everyone was excited; some people even cried. A lot of people felt a connection with him and that's important. He would get big cheers when he would say how he would not criticize or put down any other candidate. We love traveling with our dad and seeing all of you show such support for our family!
