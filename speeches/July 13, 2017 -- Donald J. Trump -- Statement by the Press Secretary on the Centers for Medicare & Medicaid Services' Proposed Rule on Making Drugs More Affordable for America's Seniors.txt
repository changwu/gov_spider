    Today marks an important step in fulfilling President Donald J. Trump's promise to lower the cost of drugs for the American people, and particularly for our Nation's seniors. The White House applauds Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma in their ongoing commitment to improving the Medicare program, and ensuring our seniors no longer pay inflated drug prices. The Trump Administration continues to work to make it easier for Americans of all ages to access quality care at affordable costs, and we look forward to seeing even more progress on this critical initiative.
