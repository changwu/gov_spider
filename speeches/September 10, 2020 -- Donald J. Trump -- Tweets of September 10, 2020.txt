For years Fake stories and investigations, then the phony Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, next Ukraine and the failed Impeachment, now the crummy Atlantic Magazine's MADE UP STORY, and lastly, the political hit job by rapidly fading Bob Woodward and his boring book. It never ends!Retweets: 27919Favorites: 118012

No, Vindman knew the call itself to the Ukrainian President was "perfect", but also knew the whistleblower report described the call incorrectly, way off. Why didn't Vindman say so?
