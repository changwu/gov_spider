    Tampa, FL – Hillary for America Florida State Director Simone Ward released today the following statement on the worsening toxic algae bloom crisis in Florida:
"The toxic algae bloom affecting waterways, residents, and small businesses across Florida's Treasure Coast is deeply concerning. It's past time for Florida officials, including Governor Rick Scott, to stop gutting commonsense rules protecting Florida's public health and unparalleled natural resources.
"Hillary Clinton knows that clean air and clean water are basic rights of all Americans, and she will fight alongside local communities and businesses to protect our environment, including the Everglades, and protect families' health."
