    I want to express my shock, revulsion, and grief over the brutal assassination earlier today of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of the Republic of India. The people of the United States join me in extending our deepest sympathy and condolences to the people of India and the Prime Minister's family as they mourn Mrs. Gandhi's death.
As Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy and Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, Mrs. Gandhi was a source of global leadership. Her determined efforts to promote peace, security, and economic development in South Asia and throughout the world will serve as a constant reminder of Mrs. Gandhi's commitment to protect the shared values of democratic nations.
The Prime Minister and I had personal correspondence recently regarding the scourge of terrorism. We agreed upon the necessity for freedom-loving states to strengthen our cooperation to stamp out this menace to humanity. Her senseless murder serves as a vivid reminder of the terrorist threat we all confront. We must therefore renew our determination to overcome this threat and ensure that Prime Minister Gandhi's accomplishments and memory will serve as an inspiration for humanity.
