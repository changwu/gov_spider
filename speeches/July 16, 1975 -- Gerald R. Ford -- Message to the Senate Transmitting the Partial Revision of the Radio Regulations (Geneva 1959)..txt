    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Partial Revision of the Radio Regulations (Geneva 1959), with a Final Protocol containing one U.S. reservation, signed on behalf of the United States at Geneva on June 8, 1974.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Partial Revision.
The primary purpose of the Revision is to update the Radio Regulations to take account of the technological state of the art and to provide for increasing operational requirements.
At the time of signature, the United States Delegation stated its reservation to one of the Revision's frequency allocation plans. It was felt that the plan and its associated procedures would be incompatible with the official and public correspondence needs of the United States. The U.S. will observe the plan to the extent practicable, but will not be bound by that provision of the Revision.
The Partial Revision will enter into force on January 1, 1976, for governments which, by that date, have notified the Secretary General of the International Telecommunications Union of their approval thereof. It is desirable that the United States be a party to the Partial Revision from the outset, and it is my hope that the Senate will take early and favorable action on the Revision and give its advice and consent to ratification.
