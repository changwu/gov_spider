NBC News: Donald Trump Booed By Conservative Crowd After Attacks on Ted Cruz
Among conservatives, Donald Trump can typically do no wrong — until he attacks Ted Cruz.
On Saturday, Trump drew boos from a grassroots conservative crowd during remarks at the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention for his attack on Cruz's previously undisclosed loans.
"You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want," he said, before boos erupted from the crowd.
Trump went on as the boos grew louder: "Say whatever you want, it's okay, he didn't report his bank loans. He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank, folks, and then he acts like Robin Hood?"
