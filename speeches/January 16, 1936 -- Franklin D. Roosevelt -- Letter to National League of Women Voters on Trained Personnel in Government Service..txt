    My dear Mrs. Gellhorn:
I do not need to tell you, as a leader among the public-spirited women of America, that it is most difficult, if not impossible, for a Government to raise and maintain in any field a standard higher than the public will support. This is why it is essential that national organizations of the character and strength of the National League of Women Voters should secure and disseminate accurate information on vital questions which have implicit within them not alone principles of efficiency and economy of interest to taxpayers, but above that the principles of good government.
It matters not what political party is in power by the elective will of the people. The Government functions for all. And there can be no question of greater moment or broader effect than the maintenance, strengthening and extension of the merit system established in the competitive principles of the Civil Service Act, whose fifty-third birthday is being celebrated this month.
The National League of Women Voters has chosen wisely in conducting a campaign for securing trained personnel in the Government service through the open competition provided only by the merit system; and I am glad to assure your great organization of my support in this effort.
Very sincerely yours,
Mrs. George Gellhorn,
National League of Women Voters,
St. Louis, Missouri.
