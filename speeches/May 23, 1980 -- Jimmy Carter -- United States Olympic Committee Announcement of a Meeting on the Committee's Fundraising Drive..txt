    President Carter met today with approximately 20 chairmen and presidents of leading American corporations to urge their support of the United States Olympic Committee's forthcoming drive to raise $30 million. The funds are needed to meet the shortfall in the Committee's regular fundraising campaign resulting from the Committee's decision, made at the request of the President and the Congress, not to send a United States team to the games in Moscow this summer.
The President has previously requested that Congress appropriate $10 million to assist the new fundraising drive on a matching basis, at the rate of 1 Federal dollar for each 2 dollars contributed from private sources.
The Committee expects to announce its new drive early next week.
