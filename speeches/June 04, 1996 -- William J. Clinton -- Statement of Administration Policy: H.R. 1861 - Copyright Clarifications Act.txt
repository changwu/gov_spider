(House)(Moorhead (R) CA)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1861.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1861 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that the net PAYGO effect of H.R. 1861 would be to increase receipts by $1 million in FY 1998. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
