    I commend the Senate for passing an election reform bill and bringing us a step closer to enacting legislation this year. I look forward to working with conferees to make sure the reforms reflect the principles outlined by the bipartisan Ford/Carter Commission that respect the primacy of State and local governments and envision a limited but responsible role for the Federal Government.
