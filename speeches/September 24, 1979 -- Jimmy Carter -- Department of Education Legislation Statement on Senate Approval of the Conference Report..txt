    The Senate's approval of the conference report on the department of education bill is a major step toward improved government efficiency. Placing Federal education programs in a separate department will allow us to manage these programs in a more effective, commonsense manner. It will cut redtape, reduce manpower levels, and save tax dollars. It will also mean better service—at less bureaucratic cost—for the State and local institutions which provide education in our country.
I would like to thank Senator Ribicoff for his excellent leadership in bringing this reorganization to final Senate passage.
