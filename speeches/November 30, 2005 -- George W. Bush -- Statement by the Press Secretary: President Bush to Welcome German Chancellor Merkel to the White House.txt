    The President will welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House on January 11, 2006. This visit will be Angela Merkel's first visit to Washington since becoming Chancellor on November 22. The two leaders look forward to discussing how the United States and Germany can intensify our partnership, strengthen transatlantic ties, and work together to advance freedom and prosperity around the world. Germany is a strong ally of the United States and a critical partner in advancing U.S.-European efforts to promote democracy in Eastern Europe, Afghanistan and the broader Middle East; strengthen the NATO Alliance; and foster global economic growth.
