    My friends, four years ago we had a big crowd in Colorado Springs, and today it is just twice as big.
That is a good idea; and I hope that you are also twice as happy as you were in 1932.
I am glad to see all these signs you display telling me to look at things. That is just what I am doing in coming out here, just what I have been doing on a good many trips in the last four years—trying to get to know this country better. I have seen the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs on several occasions before, and some day I want to come up here and spend a week or two.
You know, there has been a good deal of difference in tourists. In 1932, when I came out through here, there were a lot of tourists-but they were riding in box cars. This year there are more of them- and they are riding in Pullmans.
That is one thing I am very happy about. People all over the country have more wherewithal with which to travel and see their own country. I tell people back East that their duty is to come out West rather than go over across to Europe.
It is fine to see you all. There are a number of very distinguished gentlemen up here on the platform. Here is my old friend, your Congressman, the Senator and the Governor. And may I also present—I think you have seen this person before-may I present to you Mrs. Roosevelt?
