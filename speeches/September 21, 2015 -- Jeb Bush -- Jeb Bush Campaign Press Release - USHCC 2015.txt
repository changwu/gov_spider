    The Governor spoke at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Annual National Convention in Houston and recognized three women whose efforts and contributions epitomize the American Dream. They are truly inspiring. Please take a moment to share their stories.
Betty Manetta — The Chamber's Businesswoman of the Year heads a technology innovator that brings us Wi-Fi networks and cloud platforms that drive so much of what we do. She employs people in Plano, TX, and 4 other states.
Veronica Edwards — Through InGenesis, Veronica helps provide staffing and consulting to companies in need. She employs nearly 1,600 people all across the country.
Maria Rios — An immigrant from El Salvador, Maria started a company that specializes in non-hazardous waste removal and recycling. Today, it employs 41 people in Houston.
Thank God for America, where someone like Maria can come to our country, put her God-given talents to work, and through ingenuity and hard work create a business that brings wealth and jobs to others in her community.
This is what really makes America great.
