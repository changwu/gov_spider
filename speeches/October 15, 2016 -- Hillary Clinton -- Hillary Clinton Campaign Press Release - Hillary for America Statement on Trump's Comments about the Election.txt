    HFA Campaign Manager Robby Mook offered the following statement in response to Trump's tweets and statements about the election:
"Campaigns should be hard-fought and elections hard-won, but what is fundamental about the American electoral system is that it is free, fair and open to the people. Participation in the system—and particularly voting—should be encouraged, not dismissed or undermined because a candidate is afraid he's going to lose. This election will have record turnout, because voters see through Donald Trump's shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens."
