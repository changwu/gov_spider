    Mitt Romney today announced that former Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman will serve as a Special Adviser on Policy.
"I am happy to announce Senator Coleman as an adviser to my campaign," said Mitt Romney. "His advice will be critical as I lay out my vision for improving our economy at home and strengthening our partnerships around the world."
"The United States is facing an important moment in our nation's history," said Senator Coleman. "Whether it is turning around our struggling economy or maintaining our relationships with international allies, the next President must have the experience and leadership to keep America strong at home and abroad. Electing someone who has not been tested by the fire of experience results in failure. The last three years have proven that. Throughout his life, Mitt Romney has displayed the leadership that will be needed to get our economy back on track and to preserve, and in some cases mend, our relationships with allies around the world. As a strong supporter of Israel, I am also confident that he is the best candidate to restore America's relationship with Israel."
