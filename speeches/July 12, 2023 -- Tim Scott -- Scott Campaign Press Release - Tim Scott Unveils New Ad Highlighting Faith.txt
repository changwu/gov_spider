TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: Our country is founded upon a Judeo-Christian rock.
Our rights don't come from a government. They're inalienable. They come from a Creator.
What's missing in our public life so often are the values embedded in the Gospel.
Jesus Christ is the lord of my life. If we want a better America, I think it starts with faith in God and faith in each other.
We must preserve the ability to worship as we see fit.
I'm Tim Scott and I approved this message.
