    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA and 4 others)
The Administration has no objection to enactment of H.R. 5702. The Administration, however, will urge the Senate to delete that portion of section 4 of the bill that makes the distribution of Federal funds dependent on the racial composition of a school's student body.
In addition, the Administration will urge the Senate to delete the portion of section 6 that creates a new loan repayment program to attract faculty members from disadvantaged backgrounds to health professions schools. While the Administration supports the goal of this provision, it opposes the use of loan repayments to achieve the goal. Instead, the Administration believes that increased post-doctorate training opportunities and faculty research grants are preferable to a new loan repayment program. The Administration has repeatedly opposed loan repayment provisions in a variety of other bills.
