    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (MFCMA) (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Mutual Fisheries Relations, signed at Moscow on May 31, 1988 (the "Agreement"). This Agreement conforms with U.S. law and will replace both the Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States of November 26, 1976, as amended, and the Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of February 21, 1988.
The Agreement provides opportunities for fishermen from each country to conduct fisheries activities on a reciprocal basis in the other country's waters. The Agreement also establishes a framework for cooperation between the two countries on other fisheries issues of mutual concern. Several U.S. industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this Agreement because of their desire to conclude joint fisheries ventures with the Soviet fishing industry.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the U.S.S.R., I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
