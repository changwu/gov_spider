    Barbara Boxer is more than a Senator, she's an institution. She's served the people of California for more than three decades with distinction, fighting for the issues that are close to their homes and hearts. Thanks to Barbara, more Americans breathe clean air and drink clean water. More women have access to health care. More children have safe places to go after school. More public lands have been protected for future generations. More Americans travel on safe roads and bridges. And more young women have been inspired to achieve their biggest dreams, having Barbara as an incredible role model.
It's been a pleasure to work with Barbara. She works as hard as anyone to get things done for the people of California. When she leaves the Senate at the end of this term, she will be missed greatly. But for now, I'm looking forward to working with her for the next 2 years, on behalf of Californians and all Americans.
