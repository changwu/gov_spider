1. Stop accepting Syrian refugees â€” we can't vet them effectively.


2. Restore intelligence programs that keep us safe.


3. Reverse President Obama's disastrous defense cuts.

4. Build a multinational coalition to destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

5.   Take concrete steps to stabilize Iraq.

6. Deprive ISIS of their rallying cry by refusing to work with Assad and his partners Russia and Iran.

Destroying ISIS is vital for the national security of America and our allies. 

Marco has a clear, detailed plan to get the job done.
