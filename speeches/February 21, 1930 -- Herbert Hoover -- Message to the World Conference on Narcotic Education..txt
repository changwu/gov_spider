    I EARNESTLY commend the work of the World Conference on Narcotic Education for its recognition of the menace to society in the excessive manufacture of narcotic drugs and for their use of scientific methods and surveys to establish the facts concerning the evils and extent of the traffic in these drugs. The consistent leadership of Americans in the effort to control this traffic is a worldwide service to the health, morals, and public safety of the race.

[The Chairman of the Governing Board of the Conference of Committees of the International Narcotic Association and the World Conference on Narcotic Education]
