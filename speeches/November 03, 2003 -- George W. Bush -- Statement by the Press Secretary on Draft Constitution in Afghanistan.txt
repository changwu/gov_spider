    The United States takes note of the release by the Afghanistan Constitutional Commission and Government on November 3 of their draft Constitution for the new post-Taliban Afghanistan. The public issuance of this very important draft, the product of consultation and dialogue among Afghans, marks an important milestone in Afghanistan's political development. Now the Afghan people have the opportunity to review the draft Constitution in the period leading up to the December Constitutional Loya Jirga, which will finally approve Afghanistan's new Constitution.
