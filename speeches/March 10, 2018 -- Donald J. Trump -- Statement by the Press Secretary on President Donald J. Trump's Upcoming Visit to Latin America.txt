    President Donald J. Trump will travel to Peru next month to attend the Summit of the Americas in Lima and will meet with Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Following the President's participation at the summit, he will travel to Colombia to meet with President Juan Manuel Santos. The trip will be the President's first to Latin America, and he will participate in a series of bilateral, multilateral, and cultural engagements. This travel demonstrates the President's resolve to deepen our historical ties with our partners in the region and to strengthen our joint commitment to improve security and prosperity for the people of the Americas. The President is looking forward to meeting with partners and allies who share our values and believe that the promise of a safe and prosperous future rests in strong democracies, fair and reciprocal trade, and secure borders.
