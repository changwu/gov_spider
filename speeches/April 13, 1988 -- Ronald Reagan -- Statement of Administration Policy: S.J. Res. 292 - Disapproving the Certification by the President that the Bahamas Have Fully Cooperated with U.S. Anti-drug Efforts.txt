    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Pell (D) Rhode Island)
The Administration opposes S.J. Res. 292 and, if it is presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend a veto. On February 28, 1988, the President certified that certain major narcotics producing and/or major narcotics transit countries, including the Bahamas, have cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own to control narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering.
Disapproval of the President's certification would be seen as a hostile act, and could jeopardize one of the most cooperative drug interdiction efforts enjoyed by the United States anywhere in the world. In addition, decertification would result in requiring the United States to vote against the Bahamas for future loans requested from international development banks, which would inhibit economic growth and development of the Bahamas.
