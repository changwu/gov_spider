MITT ROMNEY: "The question of this election comes down to this: Do you want four more years like the last four years or do you want real change? President Obama promised change, but he couldn't deliver. He could not deliver the change he promised. But I not only promised change, I have a record of achieving change. I built a business. I helped turn around another one. I helped put an Olympics that was off track back on track. With the Democrat legislature, I helped my state turned from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth, and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay. And that is why I am running for president. I know how to change the course the nation is on, how to get to a balanced budget, how to build jobs and see, once again, rising take-home pay. Accomplishing real change is not something I just talk about. It is something I have done and it is something I will do as President of the United States. If you believe we can do better, if you believe America should be on a better course, if you are tired of being tired, then I ask you to vote for real change. Paul Ryan and I will bring real change to America on Day One."
