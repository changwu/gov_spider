    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, signed at Port of Spain on March 4, 1996.
In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both countries and thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. Upon entry into force, it will supersede the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Great Britain signed at London on December 22, 1931, and made applicable to Trinidad and Tobago upon its entry into force on June 24, 1935, and which the United States and Trinidad and Tobago have continued to apply following Trinidad and Tobago's independence. That treaty has become outmoded, and the new Treaty will provide significant improvements.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
