    Former Minnesota Governor and Romney for President National Co-Chair Tim Pawlenty made the following statement on tonight's debate in Iowa:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate. He clearly laid out the choice voters have in this election: do they want to vote for someone who is a creature of Washington or for someone who has been a strong leader outside Washington? Career Washington, D.C. politicians got us into this mess of high unemployment, runaway spending and reckless debt.  We cannot rely on them to get us out of it.  Mitt Romney spent his life working in the private sector.  Mitt doesn't just have ideas about how jobs are created.  He has real world experience creating them.  Mitt is also a tested problem solver who has turned around big, troubled enterprises like the Olympics and Massachusetts. Iowans know our country is in trouble. As a proven leader, Mitt will not shrink from the challenges we face."
