    Orangeburg, South Carolina Mayor Michael Butler announced that he is endorsing Mayor de Blasio for President of the United States today at the Orangeburg County Democratic Party Meeting. Butler is the first African-American Mayor of Orangeburg. The town is the county seat of Orangeburg County, which is home to the second largest population of African-American voters in the Palmetto State.
"There are many strong candidates running for the Democratic nomination. But with all he has accomplished for working families in New York City, I believe Mayor de Blasio is the best candidate to make our federal government work for the people again," said Mayor Michael Butler.
"Mayor Butler has dedicated his entire career to uplifting South Carolinians. I'm so grateful for his support and friendship, said Mayor Bill de Blasio. "With an increasingly absent federal government, Mayors are leading the charge to put working people first in this country."
