    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after SMART – the sheet metal, air, rail and transportation workers' union - endorsed her campaign for President. Clinton now has the endorsement of 23 national labor unions or labor alliances representing over 12 million American workers.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of SMART—the sheet metal, air, rail, and transportation workers' union—and their 216,000 members.
"SMART members have helped build America—and the American middle class, by fighting for higher wages, safe working conditions, and workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively.
"As President, I will fight alongside SMART to protect workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, stay safe on the job, maintain their health benefits and retire with dignity. And I will create more good-paying jobs by making significant investments in rebuilding and expanding our infrastructure—from rebuilding roads, bridges, and freight systems to modernizing our energy grid. Because to build a strong economy for the future, we need to start by building strong infrastructure today."
