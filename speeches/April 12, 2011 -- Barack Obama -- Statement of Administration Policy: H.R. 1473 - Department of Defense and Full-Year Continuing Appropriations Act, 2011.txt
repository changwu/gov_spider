(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration supports H.R. 1473, making continuing appropriations for the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies of the Government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other purposes. The legislation makes the largest annual spending cuts in the Nation's history, while at the same time investing in America's future in significant ways. Although the Administration would not have agreed to many of these cuts under better fiscal circumstances, the bill reflects a compromise that will help the Federal Government live within its means while protecting those investments that will help America compete for new jobs. These include investments in education, clean energy, and life-saving medical research. However, the Administration strongly opposes any attempts to include language in the underlying bill that would deny funding for critical women's health services or prohibit funding to implement the Affordable Care Act that is making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.
The Administration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal path. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to do so in a manner that supports the economic recovery and near-term job creation, protects key investments, and promotes long-term growth.
