    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit today for the consideration of the Congress and the American people the 1991 National Drug Control Strategy, in accordance with section 1005 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Public Law 100 - 690; 21 U.S.C. 1504).
This is the third National Drug Control Strategy, and it should be viewed as a companion to the previous two submitted in September 1989 and January 1990. This Strategy lays out a comprehensive plan for Federal drug control activities for fiscal year 1992. The principal goal remains unchanged: to reduce the level of illegal drug use in America. This goal cannot be achieved by the Federal Government acting alone, and so this Strategy calls upon all segments of our society to continue to do their part. In crafting this Strategy, we have sought the counsel not only of Federal officials and Members of the Congress, but also State and local officials; experts in the fields of drug prevention, treatment, and enforcement; and public-spirited citizens.
I am pleased to be able to report that there are indications that we are embarked on the right path: although much remains to be done and serious problems still confront us, numerous indicators show that we are beginning to see significant declines in drug use throughout the Nation. Continued congressional support is essential to ensure progress.
George Bush
The White House,
January 31, 1991.
