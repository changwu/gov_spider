    Yesterday, the President called Governor John Hickenlooper to receive an update on fires that are impacting communities across the state, including the devastating Black Forest fire that is affecting families, homes and businesses in Colorado.
The President expressed his condolences for those families who lost a loved one and expressed his concern about the extensive damage caused over the last several days. The President also expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the brave men and women fighting tirelessly to combat these devastating fires. He reinforced his commitment to continue providing necessary support to the state and local efforts. The administration will stay focused and continue to keep in constant contact with the local officials through the US Forest Service, Department of Interior, FEMA, Department of Defense and the White House.
Over 1,000 personnel are responding to these fires in Colorado and a National Wildland Fire Type 1 Incident Management Team has been deployed to assist with the response. Additionally, FEMA has approved Fire Management Assistance Grants for both the Black Forest and Royal Gorge Fires. The Department of Defense will continue to provide resources to assist with suppression efforts and assistance at the Colorado Joint Operations Center. The President asked the Governor to inform him and his team of any additional resources that could be provided to protect the communities and families in Colorado.
