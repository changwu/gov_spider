    I send warm greetings to Iranian-Americans and the Iranian people observing Nowruz, the traditional Persian New Year.
This year's observance occurs at a time when our Nation is united in its determination to make the world safe from terrorism. The community of more than one million Iranian-Americans has fully participated in this noble endeavor by condemning the terrorist acts, participating in rescue efforts at Ground Zero, and offering help and support to the victims, who included individuals of Persian heritage.
From arts and education to industry and science, Iranian-Americans have made significant and enduring contributions to the cultural and civic life of our Nation. Your observance of the traditional Persian New Year honors an ancient and storied history and marks a time of renewal. As the season changes, may your observance of Nowruz serve as a special time for you to reflect on your rich heritage and to enjoy the company of family and friends.
