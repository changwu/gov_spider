Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with roughly 12,000 American small business owners about the national response to COVID-19. The President emphasized that small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, employ nearly half of our workforce, and remain central to the Administration's actions to respond to the economic challenges caused by the virus. The President highlighted that the Small Business Administration has billions of dollars available to assist companies and has cut regulations to speed up those payments. The White House continues to engage with Congress for more relief packages for small businesses.
