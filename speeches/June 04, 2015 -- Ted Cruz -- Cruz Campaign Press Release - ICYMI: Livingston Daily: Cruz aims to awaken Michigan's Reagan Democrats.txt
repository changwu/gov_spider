Speaking to a room full of Republicans, Ted Cruz told them his presidential campaign would target Democrats — Reagan Democrats.
"We're going to rebuild the old Reagan coalition," the Texas senator said Wednesday during an appearance in Howell.
...
The sold out audience responded enthusiastically to many of Cruz' comments, with portions of the crowd taking to their feet in applause on several occasions.
...
"I think he was fantastic but, now, he has to bring it home," said Delores Brauer, a relative newcomer to party politics. "He has to win the election."
Cruz is a tea party favorite and Wes Nakagiri, of tea party-affiliated RetakeOurGov said he likes of lot of the senator has to say.
"He's definitely on my short list, bit it's early," Nakagiri said. "Four years ago, I was for Herman Cain, then he dropped out, and then for Michele Bachmann, but she dropped out. So, I'm not supporting any candidate just yet."
