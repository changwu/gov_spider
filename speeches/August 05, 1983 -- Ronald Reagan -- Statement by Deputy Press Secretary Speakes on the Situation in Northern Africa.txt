    The U.S. has a strong strategic interest in assuring that Qadhafi is not able to upset governments or to intervene militarily in other countries as is currently happening in Chad. Qadhafi has considerable resources, both military and financial, which makes Libya particularly threatening. If Libya or Libyan-supported forces were to gain control of Chad, close U.S. allies such as Egypt and Sudan would be seriously concerned about their own security. Other states in the region would also he deeply worried. It is important to the United States that its allies and friends be able to count upon its assistance to defend themselves against Libyan aggression.
