    Hillary Clinton is already under investigation by the FBI. Now she's signed a sworn affidavit to a federal judge, under penalty of perjury, that she has handed over all of her government business emails.
Which means that she's one email away from prison time. She'd better pray the Chinese government doesn't do a document dump.
Maybe her friend Martha Stewart can stop giving her interior decorating advice and give her jailhouse survival tips instead. Orange really will be the new black.
