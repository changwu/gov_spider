    President Bush will welcome First Minister of Northern Ireland Dr. Ian Paisley and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness to the White House on December 7, 2007. Over the past several years, the United States has actively supported peace efforts in Northern Ireland, which culminated in the formation of a unified Northern Ireland government. This visit marks the first time that Dr. Paisley and Martin McGuinness will visit the United States together since taking office. The President looks forward to congratulating the two leaders on overcoming years of violent conflict, and for taking the historic path toward a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland.
