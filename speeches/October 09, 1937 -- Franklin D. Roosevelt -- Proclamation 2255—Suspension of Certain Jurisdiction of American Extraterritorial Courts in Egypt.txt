    By the President of the United States of AmericaA Proclamation
Whereas by a Presidential proclamation issued on March 27, 1876, pursuant to the authority of the act of Congress approved March 23, 1874, the judicial functions theretofore exercised in Egypt by the minister, consuls, or other functionaries of the United States pursuant to the act of Congress approved June 22, 1860, were suspended, during the pleasure of the President, so far as the jurisdiction of certain Egyptian tribunals embraced matters cognizable by the minister, consuls, or other functionaries of the United States in Egypt, except as to cases actually commenced before the date of the said proclamation;
Whereas at the time of the issuance of the said proclamation the jurisdiction of the said Egyptian tribunals did not extend to certain categories of cases within the jurisdiction of the minister, consuls, or other functionaries of the United States which were accordingly retained within the jurisdiction of, and have continued to the present time to be exercised by, those functionaries;
Whereas the Government of the United States and other governments concluded a convention with the Government of Egypt on May 8, 1937, providing for the termination of the capitulatory rights now enjoyed by the United States and other powers in Egypt and providing that, during the period October 15, 1937-October 14, 1949, the judicial functions now exercised by consular courts would be exercised by the Mixed Tribunals of Egypt, except as to personal status matters—as defined in article 28 of the Réglement d'Organisation Judiciaire annexed to and forming a part of the said convention of May 8, 1937—with respect to which the said convention provides that the signatory governments may retain existing consular courts for the purpose of jurisdiction in cases involving the personal status of their respective nationals during the period October 15, 1937-October 14, 1949;
Whereas, pending the ratification of the said convention by the Government of the United States, it is in the interest of the United States to cooperate with the Government of Egypt and the other capitulatory powers by suspending the jurisdiction now exercised by the minister, consuls, or other functionaries of the United States in Egypt and consenting to the transfer of that jurisdiction to the Mixed Tribunals of Egypt, except jurisdiction in matters involving the personal status of citizens of the United States; and
Whereas satisfactory information has been received by me that the said Mixed Tribunals of Egypt are organized on a basis likely to secure to citizens of the United States in Egypt the impartial justice which they now enjoy under the judicial functions exercised by the minister, consuls, or other functionaries of the United States pursuant to the said act of Congress of June 22, 1860:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power and authority conferred upon me by the said act of Congress approved March 23, 1874, do hereby suspend, effective October 15, 1937, during the pleasure of the President, the judicial functions now exercised by the minister, consuls, or other functionaries of the United States in Egypt, except as to cases actually commenced before October 15, 1937, and except as to matters involving the personal status of citizens of the United States as defined in article 28 of the Réglement d'Organisation Judiciaire annexed to the said convention of May 8, 1937.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 9th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
