    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed request in the amount of $975 million for a supplemental appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
I am requesting these resources to cover the increased costs in FY 2005 that the VA is experiencing in its medical care system.
As Secretary Nicholson informed the Congress on June 28th, additional needs in the VA medical care system have also been identified for FY 2006. Details on specific FY 2006 requirements are under review and will be transmitted separately. My Administration is committed to ensuring that our Nation's veterans continue to receive timely and high-quality health care.
The details of the FY 2005 request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
