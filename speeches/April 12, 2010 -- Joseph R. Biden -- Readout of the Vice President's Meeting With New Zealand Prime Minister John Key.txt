    Earlier today, the Vice President met with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key who is in Washington to participate in the President's Nuclear Security Summit (NSS). New Zealand is an important partner in Afghanistan, on global issues ranging from nuclear non-proliferation to climate change, and on trade as a negotiating partner in the Trans-Pacific Economic Partnership (TPP) Free Trade Agreement. The Vice President thanked Prime Minister Key for his close cooperation on the NSS agenda and goals, and expressed his appreciation for New Zealand's strong support in Afghanistan. The Vice President and Prime Minister Key also discussed how our two countries can cooperate further on regional and global matters and work closely together at the United Nations, including on issues such as Iran.
