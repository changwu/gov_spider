    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Maine Governor Kenneth M. Curtis.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change this country needs," Curtis said. "She is uniquely qualified to repair our alliances abroad and bring the war in Iraq to an end."
Curtis served as Maine's Secretary of State from 1965 to 1966, then served two terms as Governor from 1967 to 1974.
He later served as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1977 to 1978, Ambassador to Canada from 1979 to 1981, and President of the Maine Maritime Academy from 1986 to 1994.
Curtis is a founding partner of Curtis Thaxter Stevens Broder & Micoleau and is now Senior Counsel to the firm.
"Ken has devoted his life to serving the people of Maine and our country, and I'm honored to have his support," Clinton said.
