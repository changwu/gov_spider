    Dear President Head:
As honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America, I take great pleasure in extending greetings on behalf of this Association to the Scouts and Scouters assembled at the Fourth World Jamboree and Seventh International Conference of Scouting, representing practically the whole civilized world. Since the beginning of our Scout Movement in America twenty-three years ago, more than five million men and boys have been enrolled as members, and on their behalf I send this message to Lord Baden Powell, Chief Scout of the world, and to brother Scouts abroad.
It stirs our imaginations and kindles our emotions to contemplate the possible implications growing out of this pilgrimage of these young men and boys representing more than seventy different nationalities, camping and living together for two weeks in good fellowship and harmony.
The future basis of international good-will must rest on mutual understanding and loyalty to high ideals. Such gatherings as this are among the most important contributions to world peace that have ever been developed.
I wish the Boy Scout Movement every success in this splendid undertaking and earnestly hope that the magnificent possibilities of this occasion will be realized to the greatest extent.
Most cordially,
Walter W. Head, Esq.,
President, Boy Scouts of America,
New York, N. Y.
