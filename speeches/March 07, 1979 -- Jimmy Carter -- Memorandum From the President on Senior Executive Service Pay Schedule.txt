    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Subject: SES Pay Schedule
The Senior Executive Service (SES) will go into effect on July 13, 1979. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provides for SES pay to range between the minimum rate for GS-16 of the General Schedule and EL-IV of the Executive Schedule. After consulting with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management I have determined that there shall be six salary rates for SES. Agency heads will, subject to the requirements of law, set the rate to be paid to each individual. In doing so agencies should be aware that the amounts payable to an individual before October 1, 1979, may be limited to the pay cap contained in Public Law 95391. I am establishing the following as the initial SES Schedule:ES-1 =$44,756ES-2 = $46,470ES-3 = $48,250ES-4= $50,100ES-5 = $51,450ES-6 = $52,800
The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will issue guidance and prescribe regulations for the administration of SES pay.
