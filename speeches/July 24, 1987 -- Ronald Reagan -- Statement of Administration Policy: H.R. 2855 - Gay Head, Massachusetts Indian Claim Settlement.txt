    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Studds (D) Massachusetts)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2855, because the information currently available about the validity of the Wampanoag Indian tribal claim, which is against non-Federal interests, does not adequately support a Federal contribution to a settlement.
