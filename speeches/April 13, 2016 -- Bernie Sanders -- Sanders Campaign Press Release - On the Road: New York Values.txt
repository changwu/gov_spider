"It's me, Bernie 'Brooklyn Born' Sanders and guess what Ted Cruz, I have New York values," Sanders said at the beginning of his surprise appearance on the show. "I value a living wage for all Americans. I value a justice system that treats everyone fairly. I value a government which works for all," Sanders said.
Cruz started the "New York values" nonsense as an attack on Donald Trump. "I've got some "New York values" for him too!" Sanders said. "Trump, you wouldn't know New York values if they were written in 50 foot gold letters on the side of the Empire State Building.
"New York values are the Statue of Liberty, not a wall between us and Mexico. In New York, we pride ourselves on our diversity. We don't divide people up."
