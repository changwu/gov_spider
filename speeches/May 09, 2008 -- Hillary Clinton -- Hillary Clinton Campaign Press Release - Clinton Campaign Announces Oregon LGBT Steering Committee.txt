    PORTLAND, OR â€“ The Clinton Campaign today announced the official launch of the Oregon Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Steering Committee. These leaders will work with the campaign to help organize the LGBT community for Hillary.
"The LGBT Community in Oregon is looking for a leader with a history of listening to and working with us on our issues," said Dr. Tom Barreto. "We know Hillary. We know what Hillary will accomplish as President because we've seen what she has done for us as First Lady and in the Senate."
The Clinton Campaign's LGBT Steering Committee will host of number of events to reach out to the LGBT community including hosting a LGBT phone bank on Thursday nights and visibility and outreach to the LGBT community on Saturdays.
Hillary has been a longtime ally of the LGBT community. She fought against the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) both times and has worked on legislation that would promote equality for LGBT Americans. As President, Hillary will work to ensure that gay and lesbian couples in committed relationships have the same legal rights and responsibilities as all Americans. She will also work to end discrimination in adoption laws, sign hate crimes legislation and ENDA into law, and put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
"I am proud to be receiving the support of my friends in Oregon's LGBT community," said Senator Hillary Clinton. "I am proud that so many members of the LGBT community have played key roles in this campaign and look forward to working to continue to fight for equality for all of us."
