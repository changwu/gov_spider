    On April 8, 1988, by Executive Order No. 12635, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Noriega/Solis regime of Panama. Because the Noriega/Solis regime has continued its actions and policies, the national emergency declared on April 8, 1988, must continue in effect beyond April 8, 1989. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Panama. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
George Bush
The White House,
April 6, 1989.
