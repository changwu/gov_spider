    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Marlenee (R) MT and Williams (D) MT)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1982. The National Park Service already administers four units of the National Park System commemorating the Lewis and Clark expedition, and ten other sites along the expedition's route have been designated as National Historic Landmarks. The area proposed as an interpretive center in H.R. 1982, however, is a State park that contains no nationally significant resources and is three miles away from the site where Lewis and Clark portaged around the Great Falls of the Missouri River; The latter site has already been designated as a National Historic Landmark.
