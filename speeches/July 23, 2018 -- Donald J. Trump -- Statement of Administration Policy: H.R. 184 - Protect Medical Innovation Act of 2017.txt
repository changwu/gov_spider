    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Paulsen, R-MN, and 277 cosponsors)
The Administration supports H.R. 184, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2017, which would permanently repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices. Repealing this tax would lower healthcare costs, save American jobs, and promote a patient-centered healthcare system.
The medical device tax, one of several harmful taxes enacted in Obamacare, has been delayed several times due to bipartisan recognition that, if imposed, it would raise healthcare costs for millions of Americans and penalize companies that are investing in medical device research and technology. This tax is an obstacle for patients seeking access to medical advances, and threatens to undermine the position of the United States as the global leader in healthcare investment and innovation. This tax also reduces the number of high-skilled, highly compensated American jobs. Consistent with President Trump's promise to provide relief to Americans suffering from the failures of Obamacare, the Administration calls on the Congress to repeal permanently the unnecessary and economically harmful medical device tax.
If H.R. 184 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
