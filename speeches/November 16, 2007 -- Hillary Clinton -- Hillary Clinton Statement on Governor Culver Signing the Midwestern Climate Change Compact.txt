    Senator Hillary Clinton released the following statement commending Governor Culver signing the Midwestern Climate Change Compact:
"I applaud Governor Culver and the people of Iowa for signing the Midwestern Climate Change Compact. By signing this pact, the people of Iowa have made a strong statement that they will not wait for President Bush to lead on one of the most pressing issues of our timeâ€”the energy and climate crisis. Instead, the people of Iowa and the Midwest are going to act now to transition to homegrown, cleaner forms of energy and address global warming.
I have put forward an aggressive plan to reduce global warming pollution by 80 percent below 1990 levels by mid-century. Like the Midwestern Climate Change Compact, my plan creates a market-based, cap-and-trade system for efficiently allocating pollution permits; establishes a goal of significantly increasing the amount of electricity that comes from renewable sources by 2025; requires new coal plants to have carbon capture and storage technology; increases the number of gas stations with E85 pumps; and places a huge priority on increasing our energy efficiency.
Since President Bush won't lead on this issue, states like Iowa and others throughout the Midwest have stepped up to fill in the gap. When I am President, I will make it a top priority to move our country to energy independence, address global warming, and create five million jobs in the process."
