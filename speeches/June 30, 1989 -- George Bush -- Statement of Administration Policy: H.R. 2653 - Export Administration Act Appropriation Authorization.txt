    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gejdenson (D) Connecticut and Roth (Rj Wisconsin)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2653.
H.R. 2653 is objectionable because it would: (1) authorize appropriations which are $4.4 million in excess of the Administration's request of $42.3 million for Department of Commerce export control activities; and (2) require the establishment of new regional export control assistance centers. These new centers are unnecessary and would result in the inefficient operation of the export control program.
