    THE MEMBERS of this Commission, representing management, labor and the public, are embarking upon an effort that will have far-reaching and lasting consequences for the railroad industry. The appointment of this Commission represents a major and constructive innovation that will prove to be a significant achievement in the progress of labor-management relations toward greater maturity and stability. In resolving this problem in a manner fair to the men, helpful to the industry, and in the best interests of our country, the members of this Commission will provide service of incalculable value.
Representatives of the railroads and railway labor organizations concerned have, in a letter to me, jointly recommended that Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell serve as chairman of the Commission. I am particularly pleased that Secretary Mitchell has agreed to provide this additional and significant service to our Nation in the cause of industrial peace.
