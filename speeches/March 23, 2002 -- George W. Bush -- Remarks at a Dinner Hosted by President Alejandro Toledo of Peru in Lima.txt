I want to thank my friends the President of Colombia y de Bolivia y tambien el Vice Presidente de Ecuador. Thank you all for being here as well.
I have come to Peru to congratulate the President and the people of Peru for embracing the institutions of democracy. It is such an important example for the world to see. I have come to Peru to thank the people of Peru and the President of Peru for the condolences that you sent to mi pais on September the 11th. We appreciate your prayers; we appreciate your condolences; and we appreciate your firm stand in the fight against terror.
And I bring with me the condolences of the American people for those lives and the families whose lives were affected as a result of the cowardly bombing that took place in Lima last week.
