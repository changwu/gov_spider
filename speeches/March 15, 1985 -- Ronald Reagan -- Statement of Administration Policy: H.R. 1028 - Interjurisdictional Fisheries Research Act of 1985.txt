    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Breaux (D) Louisiana and Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1028 because the 1986 Budget does not propose funding for State commercial fisheries grant programs. This type of funding should be assumed by the primary beneficiaries of such programs, and the States and fishing industry.
