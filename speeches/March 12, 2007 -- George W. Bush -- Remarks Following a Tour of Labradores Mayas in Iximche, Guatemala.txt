    The President. You know I—Mariano, when I gave a speech in the United States, I talked about you. And Mrs. Bush and I have been looking forward to meeting you because you——
Mariano Canu. So have I.
The President. ——you represent people who dream, people who work hard, and people who make wonderful products.
And there's two things I want to share. One, that USAID, which is funded through the generosity of the American people, is helping people like you all throughout the region to realize your dreams, because we believe that—we believe in the dignity of every person. And we want people to realize their God-given potential. You have proven that if just given a chance, you and hundreds of others can succeed, and that's what we want.
Secondly, free trade is important for a lot of people. It's important for our country.
Mariano Canu. It's a gateway for us.
The President. It's a gateway. It creates jobs in America just like it creates jobs here.
And so we thank you for your wonderful hospitality. We loved being with your families.
Mariano Canu. And we thank you, too, all so much for all the support you've given us, from USAID, from the Guatemalan Government, from the President. We're very, very grateful.
The President. Thank you, sir. Gracias. Que Dios les bendiga.
