    I am very pleased by the action taken by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee this morning approving Senator Bumpers' amendment on the Clinch River breeder reactor (CRBR). In adopting this amendment, the committee has endorsed a strong, technically sound research and development program that will not rush us unnecessarily toward a plutonium economy. The committee has acted in a fiscally responsible manner by voting against wasting an additional $1.5 billion of taxpayers' dollars on the CRBR.
We are currently compelled to spend $15 million per month on the Clinch River breeder reactorâ€”a project which is premature, technically outmoded, and unnecessary. With all of the critical energy needs of our country competing for Federal resources, the CRBR's continued drain on the Federal Treasury is a shameful waste.
The committee has voted to approve a sound, well-structured program to ensure that breeder technology will be available to our country if and when it is needed.
I urge the full Senate and the House of Representatives to follow the lead of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to stop wasting Federal funds on this project and save our taxpayers $1.5 billion. Fiscal responsibility and sound energy policy demand that the committee's recommendations be enacted.
