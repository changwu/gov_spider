    Sioux City, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement today in response to Governor Rick Perry's energy plan:
"Governor Perry — I appreciate you endorsing my energy ideas. Your plan is exactly what I have been talking about since I entered the race in June. With my announcement of 'American Jobs, Right Now,' I am the only candidate with a comprehensive framework to grow the economy, create jobs, unleash potential for American energy, and reform the tax code; the major distinction is that I will implement my framework without abusing executive power."
