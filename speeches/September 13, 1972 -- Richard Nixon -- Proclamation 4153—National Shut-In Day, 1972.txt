  A Proclamation

Too few Americans realize that illness or infirmity confines several million of our fellow citizens to their homes, to nursing homes, or to other institutions.
Although we are developing programs at national, State, and local levels to bring the greatest possible number of these people back into active participation in community life, there are many who will remain shut-ins for the rest of their lives. These people do not have to be shut out, shut away from our concern and from sharing in the life of their communities.
To draw attention to the plight of our shut-in citizens, and to encourage continuing efforts to lessen their isolation, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 7, 1972, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third Sunday of October 1972 as National Shut-In Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, October 15, 1972, as National Shut-In Day.
On that day, I urge all my fellow Americans who are fortunate enough not to be shut-ins to visit those who are less fortunate and are confined to their own homes, to nursing homes and to homes for the aged. In addition, I urge that this be the first of many visits, a new beginning of concern in the days that follow.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.

RICHARD NIXON
