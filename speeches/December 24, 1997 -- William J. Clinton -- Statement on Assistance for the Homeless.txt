    Today—on the eve of Christmas and the first day of Hanukkah—it is important for all Americans to come together as one community and remember those who are less fortunate, particularly our fellow citizens without the warmth and security of a home. I applaud the many Americans who dedicate their lives—and the hundreds and thousands of volunteers who work tirelessly—to help provide shelter, food, and dignity to homeless men, women, and children.
As long as there are children waking up in America on Christmas morning without the comfort of a warm home, we have more work to do. Religious and community organizations are doing their part to help alleviate homelessness. The Federal Government must do its share too.
That is why I have asked Secretary Cuomo to announce today that my next budget will provide an additional $327 million for homeless assistance—if enacted, one of the largest dollar increases ever. My new budget will request $1.15 billion to help move the homeless from the streets to self sufficiency—a 40-percent increase over this year. This amount includes 34,000 vouchers to help individuals and families who are1 now homeless celebrate future holidays in a place they can call "home." These funds will help create safer places for our children to grow up, more stable families, and a stronger American community. I look forward to working with Congress to achieve this needed assistance for the homeless.
