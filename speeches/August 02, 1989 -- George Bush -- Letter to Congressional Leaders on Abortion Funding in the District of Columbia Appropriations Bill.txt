    Dear XXXXX:
The House soon will consider the District of Columbia Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1990.
If the bill presented to me permits the use of appropriated funds to pay for abortions other than those where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, I will veto it.
I urge the Congress to vote to protect the lives of America's unborn children.
Sincerely,
George Bush
