    I HAVE APPROVED H. R. 52, "To provide increases in service-connected disability compensation and to increase dependency allowances," although the bill inadequately compensates some veterans with more serious service-connected disabilities, while providing at the same time more than necessary increases to others.
I have signed the measure notwithstanding these defects because my refusal to do so would deprive veterans with serviceconnected disabilities (a group which merits our particular concern ) of any adjustments in their compensation.
I had hoped to send comprehensive proposals for veterans' legislation to this session of the Congress, but the complexity of the issues involved, and the heavy burden of other legislation pending before the Congress, prevented this. These proposals will, however, be placed before the second session in January, 1958.
