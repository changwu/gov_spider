    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Berman (D) California and 106 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 91, although it contains several objectionable micromanagement provisions.
The Administration continues to believe that congressional micromanagement of foreign policy is an improper intrusion into Executive branch prerogatives. In addition, congressional micromanagement can adversely affect our national security by preventing appropriate responses to unanticipated international developments.
