    Dear Mrs. Egan:
Mrs. Ford and I want you to know you have our deepest sympathy. The death of your husband is as unjust as it is tragic. Words cannot capture the strain nor mitigate the suffering you have undergone, but we want you to know that our hearts are with you in this most difficult moment.
Your husband was highly esteemed in Cordoba. As U.S. Consular Agent there he served his country well. His tragic, senseless death is mourned by all men of goodwill.
GERALD R. Ford
