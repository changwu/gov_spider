    Speaking at high school alma mater, Bullock says the improbable is still achievable for all Americans
Helena, MT â€“ This afternoon, Montana Governor Steve Bullock launched his campaign for President at his alma mater, Helena High School, presenting his unifying vision for America's future: creating a democracy that ensures every American has a fair shot at success.
Introduced by his wife, Lisa Bullock, and joined by students and former Helena High School classmate and current Helena High School science teacher Julie Ladd, Governor Bullock stressed that when we unite by behind our common values, we can pass along a better America to the next generation.
"We're at our best when we embrace our shared values. When a fair shot at opportunity is within reach of every family, not just those with money. When civility replaces anger so that every voice can be heard. When we confront our greatest challenges head-on and lead the way in the community of nations. I believe we can be that country again. Working together, we can be sure of it," said Governor Steve Bullock.
"No matter who we are or what we do or who we voted for, most Americans want and value the same things: a good job, a safe community, a roof over our family's head. Good public schools, Clean air and clean water. And the unwavering belief we can build a better life for our kids and grandkids."
