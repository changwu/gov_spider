CONCORD, NH - GOP Presidential candidate Ron Paul got a roaring welcome back to New Hampshire as 450 supporters and undecided voters packed his first town hall meeting since the Iowa Caucuses.

The Granite State Room in the Memorial Union Building at UNH-Durham was standing room only as Dr. Paul and NH State Senator Jim Forsythe took the stage for a brief discussion followed by questions from the audience.
"We had two overflow crowds today," said NH State Director Jared Chicoine. "And that as two polls were released showing a widening gap in this state between the two top candidates and the rest of the field.
"Dr. Paul is drawing crowds because he is the only believable candidate on the issue that will define this country in 2013 and beyond: real, sound economic growth for the American people."
