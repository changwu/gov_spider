    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former United States Ambassador to Canada and South Carolina Speaker of the House David Wilkins. Ambassador Wilkins previously had supported Governor Rick Perry's campaign.
"I'm honored to have earned the endorsement of Ambassador Wilkins," said Mitt Romney. "This important show of support demonstrates that my message of a 'Simpler, Smaller, and Smarter' federal government is resonating with South Carolina leaders and voters."
Announcing his support, Ambassador Wilkins said, "Americans want a candidate they can believe in; one who can defeat President Obama and get our country back to work.  Mitt Romney is that man.  Governor Romney would never turn his back on 20,000 new jobs and our energy security as the President has done with the Keystone XL pipeline project.  Mitt Romney has a real plan for restoring our economy and our place in the world as freedom's best friend and most steadfast defender."
