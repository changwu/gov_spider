    We were saddened to learn of the passing of former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who led West Germany during a pivotal period in the country's history. He was a firm, sure voice in a time of uncertainty and was widely admired for his principled approach to advancing detente while also standing firmly against aggression and violations of fundamental freedoms and human rights. His work helped advance our shared vision of building a peaceful and democratic Europe. We offer our condolences to his family, loved ones, and all citizens of a united Germany.
