    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lowey (D) NY and 6 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5124. In particular, the Administration objects to Section 3 which would provide forgiveness of Perkins loans for full-time Federal, State and local law enforcement officers. There is no evidence that student loan forgiveness has been an effective incentive for students to enter a particular profession. Such provisions are costly and would provide enormous windfalls to persons who already intend to become law enforcement officers.
The Administration also objects to the followina Drovisions of the bill:

—  Section 4, which would mandate specific, detailed requirements for States wishing to establish drug-free school zones. These requirements would likely become a disincentive to"the States to create drug-free school zones.
—  Section 5, which would require the Secretary to reserve $5 million for replication of successful drug abuse education programs. This reservation would duplicate activities already authorized under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 (DFSCA).
—  Section 7, which would require that 50 percent of the funds for the current teacher training program in DFSCA be used to train counselors, social workers, psychologists, or nurses. There is no demonstrated need for such a change in training priorities. Current priorities already include funding for this group.
—  Section 8, which would add burdensome new requirements to the grant application process for localities and might discourage participation in DFSCA programs.
