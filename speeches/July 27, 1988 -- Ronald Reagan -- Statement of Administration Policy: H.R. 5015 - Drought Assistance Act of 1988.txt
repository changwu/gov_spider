    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(de la Garza (D) Texas and 76 others)
The Administration supports legislation to protect America's farmers from excessive losses during the current drought, subject to.the five points cited by the President in his letter of July 25th (attached) to the congressional leadership on this legislation.
Time has not permitted the Administration to complete its review of the amendments adopted yesterday by the House Agriculture Committee. Accordingly, the Administration urges the Rules Committee to adopt a rule that will allow amendments necessary to ensure that enactment of H.R. 5015 will not trigger automatic budget sequestration cuts that will be required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act if the deficit for Fiscal Year 1989 exceeds $146 billion.
It is essential that changes in H.R. 5015 be made to avoid a sequester. Otherwise, as stated by the President, such automatic cuts "would take back from farmers with one hand what we are providing in drought relief with the other."
