    Hillary Clinton released the following statement about the announcement that the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees have endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. Clinton now has the endorsement of 21 national labor unions or labor alliances representing over 12 million American workers.
"For decades, members of IATSE have entertained and delighted Americans, but that's not all. IATSE has fought for good pay and safe working conditions and the chance for everyone who works hard to get ahead. As President, I will stand with IATSE and with hard-working Americans across our country.
"We'll fight back against corporate efforts to misclassify workers as independent contractors in an attempt to shirk paying fair wages and earned benefits. And we'll stand up for the right to organize and bargain collectively. I'm proud to have the Theatrical Stage Employees standing with me and I'll always stand with them. Together we'll protect the hard-won progress we've made, not let a Republican President rip it all away â€”because when workers are strong, families are strong, and when families are strong, America is strong."
