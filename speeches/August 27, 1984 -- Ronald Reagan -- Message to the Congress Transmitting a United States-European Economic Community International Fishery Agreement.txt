    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) (the Act), I transmit herewith the text of a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the European Economic Community (EEC), which was initialed at Washington on June 27, 1984.
This agreement will replace the existing governing international fishery agreement with the EEC, which entered into force on June 9, 1977, and is now due to expire no later than September 30, 1984. This agreement may be signed by the European Economic Community only following the completion of EEC internal procedures, which are now underway. I am transmitting this final text to you prior to its signature. While it is the usual practice to transmit to the Congress only signed agreements, it is my intention in this case that this transmittal initiate the period for Congressional review under Section 203(a) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1823(a)) to further the objectives of that Act. Like other such agreements, it will enter into force only after the completion of the requirements of Section 203 of the Act, signature of the Agreement by both Parties, and written confirmation that the internal procedures of the EEC have been completed.
