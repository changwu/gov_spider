    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Talent (R) MO)
The Administration supports the goal of encouraging agencies to use electronic submission, maintenance, and disclosure of information in order to reduce paperwork burdens on small businesses and other members of the public. Although legislation is not necessary to accomplish this goal, the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 852, as reported by the House Small Business Committee.
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13) and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-106) already encourage and direct agencies to collect and use information through electronic and other technical means where it makes programmatic and economic sense to do so.
