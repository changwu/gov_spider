    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Davis (R) Michigan and 4 others)
The Administration urges that H.R. 4731 not be considered under suspension of the rules, but under a rule permitting adoption of amendments. The Administration would not object to enactment of H.R. 4731 if it were amended to:
delete section 5(c), which would imprudently divert boating safety funds from purposes truly related to boating safety and interfere with the Coast Guard's ability to manage the recreational boating safety program and delete the reauthorization of the National Boating Safety Advisory Council, which is unnecessary.
