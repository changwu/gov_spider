    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/2/93)(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and 11 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2134. However, the Administration will seek certain improvements in the bill as it continues through the legislative process. These include clarifications to avoid potential constitutional questions about amending an existing interstate compact and requiring enforcement action by the Secretary of Commerce based on a determination made by an entity that is not part of the Federal Government.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2134 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that the pay-as-you-go effect would be less than $500,000 over FYs 1994-1998.
