Within "hailing" distance according to new Rasmussen survey


LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” According to a newly released survey from Rasmussen, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul comes within "hailing" distance of President Obama, doing better than a majority of the other Republican contenders. The poll puts Paul only 4 points behind Obama at 37 percent to the president's 41 percent, with a plus/minus 3 percent margin of error.
"This is more exciting news for Dr. Paul's supporters," said Ron Paul 2012 spokesman Jesse Benton. "As we've been seeing in poll after poll, Americans are sick of the status quo and are eager to support a leader who stands for constitutionally limited government and individual liberty. Ron Paul is that leader"
In a similar head to head survey from last year done by Rasmussen, Paul actually drew a statistical dead heat with the president. And earlier this year in a survey by CNN he does the best out of the other Republicans put up against Obama in a head to head poll.
