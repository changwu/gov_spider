    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Bonilla (R) TX and 16 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 821, which would extend eligibility for VA burial benefits to reserve and national guard personnel who never served on active duty. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has consistently opposed similar proposals. Veterans benefits programs enacted by Congress over the last four decades are normally not available to those individuals whose military service does not include active duty.
According to VA, the enactment of H.R. 821 would have the effect of limiting future availability of space in national veterans' cemeteries for active-duty veterans.
