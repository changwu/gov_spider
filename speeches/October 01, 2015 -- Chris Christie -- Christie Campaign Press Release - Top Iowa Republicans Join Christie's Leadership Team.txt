MORRISTOWN, NJ - Today, top Iowa Republicans announced they are joining Christie's leadership team. The team is made up of influential business and community leaders from across the state. These leaders have deep roots in Iowa politics and will be instrumental in communicating Christie's proven record and bold ideas to Iowans in every county.
State Chairman Kraig Paulsen, Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, stated, "I am excited to be a part of this great team of Iowa leaders supporting Governor Chris Christie. The Governor's record of conservative reforms in one of the bluest states in the nation is unique and impressive. He has cut taxes, cut spending, shrunk government and returned fiscal sanity to the New Jersey budget. Governor Christie's political courage and strong leadership skills are needed in Washington, and I firmly believe that he is the candidate to lead our party in 2016 and beyond."
"I'm proud to be a part of Governor Christie's leadership team here in Iowa, along with so many other great Republicans. Governor Christie's strong conservative record, substantive plans for the future of our nation, and honest and direct style is exactly what our country needs in a leader. In Iowa, we're blessed with strong executive leadership, and Governor Christie will bring that same kind of experience to Washington DC on day one," said Adrianne Branstad
