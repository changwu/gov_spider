    Yesterday afternoon, on the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of its independence, Cape Verde became the second African country to sign a Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The United States congratulates the Government of Cape Verde for its hard work with the Millennium Challenge Corporation to develop this $110 million program to improve transportation, agricultural productivity, and private sector development, and for its commitment to ruling justly, investing in its people, and promoting economic freedom.
