    Hillary Clinton, who has announced a series of proposals this month to defend and build upon the Affordable Care Act, released the following statement Tuesday calling for the repeal of the law's so-called "Cadillac Tax" provision:
"The Affordable Care Act is working, plain and simple. It has extended quality, affordable health insurance to millions of Americans, begun to rein in the growth of overall health care spending across the country, and provided important new protections to consumers, especially young people and anyone with a pre-existing condition. President Obama doesn't get enough credit for this historic achievement, and Republicans' obsession with repeal is dead wrong. We should be defending and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, not scrapping it.
"I have proposed new reforms to build on the progress we've made and lower out-of-pocket costs for families. Too many Americans are struggling to meet the cost of rising deductibles and drug prices. That's why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac Tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal.
"My proposed reforms to our health care system would more than cover the cost of repealing the Cadillac Tax, while also reining in skyrocketing prescription drug costs and out-of-pocket expenses for hard-working families. As President, I will continue to fight to make our health care system more value-driven and cost-efficient, and to drive down costs for patients and families."
