Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!Retweets: 28351Favorites: 125268

Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week live from the Oval Office that the Republicans didn't have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!Retweets: 28189Favorites: 113127

Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes but as shown in the House good things happen. If enough Dems don't vote it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!Retweets: 16593Favorites: 73249

The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else's that will work and that has been true for thousands of years. It's like the wheel there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone & technology.....Retweets: 22063Favorites: 101281

.....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work and the Democrats are lying when they say they don't. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!Retweets: 15582Favorites: 67948

No matter what happens today in the Senate Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes and we won big. I am very proud of you!Retweets: 17819Favorites: 78125

The Democrats whose votes we need in the Senate will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don't want Open Borders and Crime!Retweets: 19337Favorites: 81582

Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall or Fence and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done one way or the other!Retweets: 20752Favorites: 93214

Thank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security! Have my total support.Retweets: 15951Favorites: 69823

There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.Retweets: 17272Favorites: 78064

General Anthony Tata author 'Dark Winter.' I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS.'Retweets: 21921Favorites: 80666

Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America's Southern Border! https://t.co/ws6LYhKcKlRetweets: 22682Favorites: 103894
