Hello
I'm your supplemental pool reporter for an event the VP is doing this morning. Pool loaded into the vans at approximately 8:38 am on this bright sunny day. Destination unknown. I'm waiting for guidance from the White House.

VP supplemental pool report #7
Uneventful ride back to the White House. The press van went separately from the VP's motorcade. We arrived at 10:35 am. That's it for me.
Cheers
