The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace. They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don't want to look at the DNC Server) but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED & acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena!Retweets: 30843Favorites: 110777

This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!Retweets: 27912Favorites: 95339

The reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go to favorite is that for many years Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. It is called the 'chicken tax.' If we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here.....Retweets: 17319Favorites: 71225

.....and G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio Michigan & Maryland. Get smart Congress. Also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades. The President has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M. event it is being studied now!Retweets: 17602Favorites: 73674
