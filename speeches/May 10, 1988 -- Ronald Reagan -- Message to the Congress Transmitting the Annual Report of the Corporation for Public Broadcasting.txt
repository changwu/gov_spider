    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for Fiscal Year 1987. The report implies that funding to the Corporation should be expanded. This does not reflect my views. My budget requests that the Congress freeze funding to the Corporation at its 1988 level of $214 million. I request that the Congress appropriate no more than the level I have proposed.
