America's Strength:
Unlike Senator Barack Obama (D-IL), Governor Romney Will Not Meet With Some Of The World's Worst Dictators. "Romney says Obama was wrong to say he'd meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria and North Korea. 'The president of the United States does not bestow our dignity and the power of our reputation around the world around those people,' Romney says. 'It's a remarkable difference if a Democratic president like Barack Obama were running this country.'" (O. Kay Henderson, "Romney Sides With Clinton In Foreign Policy Spat," Radio Iowa, 7/26/07)
