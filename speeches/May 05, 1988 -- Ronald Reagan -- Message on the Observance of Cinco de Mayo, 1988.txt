    I am delighted to join the people of Mexico and all those of Mexican heritage in the United States in celebrating Cinco de Mayo, the historic anniversary of Mexican independence and freedom.
On May 5, 1862, Mexican troops led by General Ignacio Zaragoza defeated invading French forces at the Battle of Puebla. The Mexicans, though greatly outnumbered, were carried on to victory by their unswerving belief in liberty and independence. Today, Cinco de Mayo stands as a symbol of the love of democracy and freedom which continues to burn in the hearts of men and women throughout the Americas.
Mexico and the United States share a proud tradition of courage and conviction. As neighbors both in spirit and locale, we look to the future with faith in our continued friendship. The United States has indeed been blessed by her citizens of Mexican descent, and I am confident that our two peoples will continue to grow in friendship and mutual enrichment.
On this special day, I am happy to send warm congratulations and good wishes to the people of Mexico, our citizens of Mexican descent, and all who cherish liberty. Que Dios los bendiga!
RONALD REAGAN
