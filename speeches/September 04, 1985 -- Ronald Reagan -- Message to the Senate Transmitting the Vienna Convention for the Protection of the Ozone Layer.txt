    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The report of the Department of State, the final act of the conference that adopted the Convention, and an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The Convention provides a foundation for global multilateral undertakings to protect the environment and public health from the potential adverse effects of depletion of stratospheric ozone. The Convention addresses this important environmental issue primarily by providing for international cooperation in research and exchange of information. It could also serve as a framework for the negotiation of possible protocols containing harmonized regulatory measures that might in the future be considered necessary to protect this critical global resource.
The Convention, which was negotiated and adopted under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), will be an important step toward protecting and enhancing public health and the quality of the global environment. The United States played a leading role in the negotiation of the Convention. Expeditious ratification by the United States will demonstrate our continued commitment to progress on this significant environmental issue.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
