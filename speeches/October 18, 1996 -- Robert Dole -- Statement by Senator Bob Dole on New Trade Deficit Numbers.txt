    Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole today released the following statement:
"Bill Clinton's trade policy continues to sacrifice American jobs to China, Japan and our other many foreign competitors.
"Today's trade numbers are proof perfect why economic anxiety is endemic among American workers. Under Bill Clinton's misguided trade policy, the merchandise trade deficit for the month of August was $1 billion. This is the second-highest monthly trade deficit in history. The highest monthly deficit in history was the previous month of July.
"The total Clinton trade deficit for 1996 will clearly be bigger than the all-time record annual deficit, set in 1995, of $175 billion.
"The August trade deficit with China also set a new all-time record: $4.7 billion. Once again, the trade deficit with China is eclipsing the trade deficit with Japan.
"These deficits mean that thousands and thousands of American jobs are being given away to foreign countries. Clinton's trade policy is to sell off American jobs, and to sell out American workers and communities, to the lowest bidder.
"Clinton even sold out American jobs to his friends in Indonesia. The trade deficit was Indonesia alone was one-half a billion dollars in August. The deficit with Indonesia in 1995 set a new record, and will do so again this year.
"Bill Clinton's weak trade policies are destroying high-wage manufacturing jobs in America. This alarming record must be reversed."
