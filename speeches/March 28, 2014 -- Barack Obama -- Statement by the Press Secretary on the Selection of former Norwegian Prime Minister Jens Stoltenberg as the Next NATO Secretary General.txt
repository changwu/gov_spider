    We welcome the selection of former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as NATO's next Secretary General, beginning October 1, 2014. Mr. Stoltenberg is a proven leader with a demonstrated commitment to the transatlantic Alliance. As Prime Minister, he built Norway's military capabilities and actively contributed to NATO operations and political dialogue. We are confident he is the best person to ensure the continued strength and unity of the NATO Alliance.
We also are grateful for the service of current NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and will rely on his expertise to bring the Alliance through the NATO Summit in September. Secretary General Rasmussen has been an exceptional leader at an extraordinary time. His vision and dedication have strengthened the Alliance's strategic direction and focus on ways to bolster defense capabilities while reinforcing the commitments and values underpinning it. From preparing for NATO's transition in Afghanistan, to seeing us through the intervention in Libya, and — now — to providing strong leadership in the face of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, Secretary General Rasmussen has been a steadfast partner and a trusted friend of the United States throughout his tenure. We know that Mr. Stoltenberg will prove the same.
