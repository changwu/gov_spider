    "Nearly four years ago, President Obama promised Virginians that he would jumpstart our nation's economy. But after years of failed economic policies that have left nearly twenty-three million Americans struggling for work, it's clear President Obama doesn't have what it takes to get our economy moving again." â€“Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just 'are you better off than you were four years ago?', it's 'are you better off than you were four weeks ago?'" (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks, Richmond, VA, 10/22/08)

The Richmond Times-Dispatch: Obamacare Will "Raise Health Care Costs, The Deficit, Taxes, And Insurance Premiums."

Members of the public understand this all too well." (Editorial, "Health Care: 'You Dummies,'" The Richmond Times-Dispatch, 9/27/10)

The news marked an abrupt end for a company once considered among the most innovative in a fast-changing industry. The bankruptcy also represents a high-profile failure for a federal stimulus program that gives loan guarantees to green-tech manufacturers. Solyndra was the first company to win one of the guarantees, receiving $535 million in 2009 to build its second factory in Fremont less than a mile from the company's original plant." (David R.
