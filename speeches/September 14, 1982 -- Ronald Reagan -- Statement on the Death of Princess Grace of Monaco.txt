    Nancy and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the tragic and untimely death of Her Serene. Highness, Princess Grace of Monaco. Princess Grace was deeply loved by the people of Monaco because she was a compassionate and gentle lady who had a deep and abiding affection for her adopted country and people. As an American, Princess Grace brought character and elegance to the performing arts and always found time to make important contributions to her craft.
The Principality of Monaco and the world community have suffered a great loss. To the people of Monaco and to the Royal Family, we extend our deepest sympathy.
