    Today, the President congratulated Honduras on the approval of its Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) Compact by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Board. The $215 million Compact will link rural farmers to the local, regional, and global economies through a comprehensive rural development program and an upgraded transportation network, raising rural incomes and strengthening the region as a whole. It is an example of the innovative and results-oriented approach to development the President launched through the MCA, a groundbreaking initiative that rewards countries that govern justly, invest in their people, and promote economic freedom.
