    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the passing of political scientist James Q. Wilson:
"America has today lost one of its most incisive thinkers and greatest teachers. Ann and I mourn the passing of James Q. Wilson. The range of his interests was matched by the extraordinary depth and thoughtfulness with which he approached basic questions of political life and the human condition. His enormous contribution to American scholarship changed the way we think about the world."
