    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Weicker (R) Connecticut)
The President will veto S.J. Res. 81 if it is passed by the Congress.
S.J. Res. 81 would not encourage the Sandinistas to move toward peace and democracy. To the contrary, it would reward their inflexibility and send the message that they need only wait for the United States to lose its resolve. The resolution's unilateral termination of aid to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance would deprive the administration of one of the most critical elements of leverage it has with the Sandinistas, and make successful negotiations for a democratic outcome in Nicaragua virtually impossible.
