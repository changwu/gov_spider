    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Congressman Julian Dixon. Julian was a champion for the people of his district, his State, and our Nation. In his 22 years in the United States Congress, Julian worked tirelessly for his district, served with distinction on the appropriations and intelligence committees, was a powerful advocate for the people of the District of Columbia, and worked hard to make sure that the voices of the less fortunate could always be heard. He was a kind, gentle man who earned the admiration and respect of all who knew him. I saw that recently when we visited a wonderful diner in his district together. I will miss him, and I join all Americans in honoring Julian Dixon for this lifetime of service to his country. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Bettye, his son, Cary, his family, and many friends.
