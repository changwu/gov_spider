    Verona, PA - The conservative outpouring of support to Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum following his stand against the New York Times continues. The latest conservative voice rallying to defend Rick Santorum is former Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin during an appearance with Greta Van Susteren on FOX News.
"It was good, and it was strong, and it was about time because he's saying enough is enough of the liberal media twisting the conservative words, putting words in his mouth, taking things out of context and even just making things up. So when I heard Rick Santorum's response, I was like well, welcome to my world, Rick, and good on ya. Don't retreat."
