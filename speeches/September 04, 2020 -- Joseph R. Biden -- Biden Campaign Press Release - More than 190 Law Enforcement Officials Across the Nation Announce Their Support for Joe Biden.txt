    Today, more than 190 law enforcement officials across the nation endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. Their endorsement comes on the heels of Donald Trump's attempts to characterize himself as the 'Law and Order' president despite failing to condemn violence, his gross mismanagement of the coronavirus, and his incitement of chaos, destruction and violence as a way to rally his base and advance his political agenda. Additionally, 23 Democratic Attorneys-General have already endorsed Biden.
Furthermore, in their endorsement, the law enforcement officials underscored Joe Biden's experience keeping communities safe, his vision for the country, and his ability to unify and heal the nation during times of crisis, tragedy, and economic stress.
"Joe Biden has always stood on the right side of the law and is offering a much needed vision for our Nation. When asked the question, would you feel safe in Joe Biden's America? The answer is yes," said Retired Chief and former President of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, Tom Manger. "I've worked with Vice President Biden for years and know that he can heal the divide in our Country. He has condemned violence of all kinds, and there is no question that I would feel safe in Joe Biden's America."
"It's ironic that a lawless President claims to be the 'law and order' president. We are at a crossroads with this nation, and we need a president that has always prioritized the safety of Americans and their families," said Retired Chief Noble Wray. "We have seen time and time again that Donald Trump has prioritized advancing his own political interests before considering the well-being and livelihood of Americans."
"COVID has devastated our economy, killed thousands of Americans. The murder rate is up, and more cops have died of COVID-19 this year than on patrol," said retired Col. Illinois State Police Joann Johnson. "Yet, despite all that, Donald Trump has continued to insist he is the law and order president without condemning violence, providing a plan to control COVID-19, or a path for economic recovery. Joe Biden has done all those things but, most importantly Joe is a ma of character and of family values who I believe can heal our nation and begin to restore the trust between law enforcement and communities of color."
"President Trump failed to protect America so now he is trying to scare America. I talk to law enforcement officers here in Arizona and all across the country: and none of them believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected," said former Republican Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods. "One of his top advisors even expressed hope for more discord and violence in our cities in a cynical ploy to use division as a political strategy. Joe Biden is offering a different vision. He's going to bring Americans together to address the challenges our country faces."
