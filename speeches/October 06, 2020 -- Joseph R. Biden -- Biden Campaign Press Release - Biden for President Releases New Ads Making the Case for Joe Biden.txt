    Today, Biden for President released two new ads that make the case for Joe Biden's positive vision for the country, emphasizing how he will be a President who gets things done for all Americans. Amid the ongoing pandemic and economic crisis, both ads highlight Biden's commitment to getting the virus under control, protecting and expanding health care, and supporting working families.
"Gets It Done" is a 0:60 spot that demonstrates how Biden calls on experts to get an update on the virus, works with doctors and patients to write his health care plan, and listens to small business owners and workers to create an economic plan — all to ensure he helps working American families. "Joe Biden brings everyone to the table and gets it done," the ad declares.
