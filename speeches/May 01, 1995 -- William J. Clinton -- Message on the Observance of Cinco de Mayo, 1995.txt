    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
The Fifth of May offers all of us a chance to celebrate the cultural diversity that helps to make our nation great. The vibrant Mexican culture, based on faith, family, and patriotism, has added a wealth of tradition to this country. Cinco de Mayo is an important part of this legacy, reminding us of the courage and commitment that can sustain the forces of freedom even when they are confronted with overwhelming opposition.
The liberty won by the outnumbered Mexican army more than a century ago lives on today as a part of the rich heritage of the Mexican people. Each time we remember the victory at the Battle of Puebla, we rejoice in the triumph of freedom and the blessings of tradition.
Hillary and I are pleased to extend best wishes for a most memorable and enjoyable holiday.
BILL CLINTON
