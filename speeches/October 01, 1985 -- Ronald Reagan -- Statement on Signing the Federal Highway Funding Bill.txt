    I have signed S. 1514, which will approve the Interstate Cost Estimate (ICE) and the Interstate Substitute Cost Estimate (ISCE). Signing this bill will permit the timely release of about $4.8 billion in Federal aid highway funds. My administration has consistently urged the passage of a clean ICE and ISCE approval bill to permit the release of about $4.8 billion in highway user fees. In the past 2 years, delays in approval of the ICE and ISCE have tended to disrupt highway construction plans. We must continue to keep the highway program free of costly special interest projects that hamper our ability to fund the national Federal interest highway system. It is with great pleasure that I sign S. 1514.
