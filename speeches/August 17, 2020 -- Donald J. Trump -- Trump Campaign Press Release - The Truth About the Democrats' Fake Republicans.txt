    None of them supported President Trump in 2016.
The four "Republicans" featured at the Democrat convention tonight are nothing but useful idiots for the radical left. They would have gladly turned over our country to Crooked Hillary, and they're still supporting the far-left Democrat agenda. Here's the truth:

John Kasich is a sore loser and a political opportunist who went back on his word to support the Republican nominee in 2016. In 2012, he said Joe Biden was a liar. Apparently they both are!
Susan Molinari is a swamp creature who made millions lobbying on behalf of Vladimir Putin. When she worked for Russia, she lobbied then-Senator Joe Biden's office on multiple occasions.
Meg Whitman voted for Crooked Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was even her guest at the final presidential debate.
Christine Todd Whitman voted for Crooked Hillary Clinton in 2016.

A sore loser, a Putin pal, and two Crooked supporters. Who would want those endorsements?
