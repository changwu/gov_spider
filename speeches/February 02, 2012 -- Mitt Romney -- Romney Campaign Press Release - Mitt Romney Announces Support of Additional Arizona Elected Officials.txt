    Mitt Romney today announced additional Arizona elected officials supporting his campaign.
"I am heartened by the support of so many of Arizona's conservative leaders," said Mitt Romney. "This shows that my message of a simpler, smaller, and smarter federal government is resonating with the American people. With the help of these leaders, I look forward to bringing this message to Arizona."
"This administration's financial policies have decimated the middle class," said Mesa Mayor Scott Smith. "We simply cannot afford to continue policies that increase unemployment and mortgage our grandchildren's future to China. Mitt Romney has a detailed jobs plan to get Americans back to work and rebuild the middle class. I am confident he will also fix the generations-long problem of illegal immigration. He is the conservative champion we need in the White House."
