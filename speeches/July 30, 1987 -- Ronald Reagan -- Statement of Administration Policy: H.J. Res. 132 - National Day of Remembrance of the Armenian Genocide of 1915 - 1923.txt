    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lehman (D) California and 166 others)
This administration is unconditionally opposed to genocide as it has demonstrated in countless ways.
The administration strongly opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 132. This resolution calls for a day of remembrance of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. Enactment of this resolution would be gratuitously offensive to the government and people of Turkey and would seriously damage both the vital relationship between Turkey and the United States and the NATO Alliance. Furthermore, enactment of this resolution might encourage further terrorist acts.
