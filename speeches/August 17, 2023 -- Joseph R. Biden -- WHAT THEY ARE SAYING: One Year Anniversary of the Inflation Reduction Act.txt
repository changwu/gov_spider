    Yesterday, the Biden Administration celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – a key piece of the President's Bidenomics agenda to grow the economy from the middle out and bottom up – which reduces costs for Americans, invests in America, makes the tax code fairer, and takes the most ambitious climate action in history. One year in, the Inflation Reduction Act is putting America on a path to achieve President Biden's goal of reducing emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, unleashing a clean energy and manufacturing boom, and already lowering energy and health care costs for millions of Americans.
The law has already created over 170,000 good-paying and union jobs in clean energy manufacturing, and it is projected to create more than 1.5 million additional jobs over the next decade according to estimates by outside groups. Four million seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries are benefitting from $35 insulin and 15 million Americans are saving $800 per year on health insurance premiums. The law also makes the wealthy pay their fair share by enabling the IRS to crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and big corporations, and modernizes IRS technology to improve services and cut wait times for law-abiding taxpayers.
Leaders across sectors, at the national, state and local levels praised the historic progress made over the last year and the benefits still yet to come from the Inflation Reduction Act – made possible by the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats, without a single Republican vote.
See what Congressional, state and local government officials, labor and union organizations, clean energy companies and manufacturers, climate, health care, and economy leaders are saying below:

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi: "When President Biden affixed his signature to the #InflationReductionAct one year ago today, America not only made history – but we made progress on the most pressing challenge of our times. At a time when devastating disasters are wreaking havoc on communities across the country, the Inflation Reduction Act delivers $370 billion to combat the climate crisis – the biggest climate action in human history! Our investments will advance clean air and clean water, create millions of good-paying jobs, strengthen global security and honor our moral obligation to pass on a healthy planet to future generations. At the same time, families are feeling the impact at their kitchen table. Medicare will soon have the power to negotiate the price of prescription drugs. Seniors can now get insulin for just $35 a month. And fifteen million Americans are saving an average of $800 per year on health insurance through ACA exchanges. This historic progress was achieved without a single Republican vote. It is because of the vision of President Biden, the commitment of Congressional Democrats and the persistence of the outside mobilization that, today, we celebrate this monumental legislative achievement."

The Inflation Reduction Act is delivering for the American people, and it will continue to do so for years to come. The law is making prescription drugs and health care more affordable for millions of American families. Already this year, seniors are paying less for lifesaving insulin as the law caps the cost at $35 per month. Now, pharmaceutical companies have followed suit and are lowering the cost of insulin for more Americans, something that simply would not have happened without the passage of this law. Drug companies are also being forced to pay penalties when they raise prices above the rate of inflation, which has resulted in seniors receiving discounts on 43 drugs so far this year. And next month, the Department of Health and Human Services will announce the first 10 drugs it plans to negotiate lower prices on so seniors are no longer paying outrageously high prices. It is also dramatically lowering the cost of monthly health insurance premiums for millions of Americans, with four in five customers able to find health care coverage for $10 or less per month on HealthCare.gov. The Inflation Reduction Act is the single-largest investment in climate action in American history, already growing our economy with more than 170,000 new, good-paying clean energy jobs right here at."

The Inflation Reduction Act will revitalize U.S. manufacturing, grow clean energy, and support and create good union jobs across the country. It will help clean up our air and water and is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 42% by 2030 while creating the good-paying, union jobs we need to give all workers the opportunity for a middle-class life."

Climate Power: "President Biden's landmark climate and clean energy plan is one of the most successful pieces of legislation in history. In just a year since its passage, manufacturing has come back to the U.S., the economy is booming, costs are coming down and we're reducing pollution. Because we're investing in America again, already companies have announced over 170,600 clean energy jobs in small towns and big cities all across the country. President Biden and Democrats' clean energy plan is delivering for America — it's growing our economy and strengthening our middle class." [Statement, 8/16/23]
The Business Council for Sustainable Energy: "One year ago today, BCSE released a powerful statement: 'With President Biden's signature of the Inflation Reduction Act, clean energy enters a new era.' Now with one year of hindsight, I can say confidently that we were correct. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has changed the clean energy landscape faster than many of us could have expected, creating the market signals and incentives for the clean energy transition to become hard-wired into the U.S. economy." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Rewiring America: "The Inflation Reduction Act's history, for many months prior to the bill signing a year ago to today, is a story of making the ephemeral concrete. It is a monumental legislative achievement that almost broke our hearts and then thrilled us with its scope. For the last 12 months, we and other organizations and leaders in the federal, state, and local spheres have worked thoughtfully to bring this massive investment to people in every community and of every income level, to make the policy and dollars real and tangible in our lives." […] Each of these work streams, and the work of so many others to make the IRA concrete in our lives, is vital for our future. By upgrading the machines we use to heat and cool our homes, heat our water, cook our food, dry our clothes, and power our lives, each of us can help the country meet our climate goals, and improve the comfort, health, and cost of living in our homes for years to come."

Marcene Mitchell, Senior Vice President of Climate Change, World Wildlife Fund: "Today we celebrate and can take stock of the progress made in the first year of the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA is a launching point, a climate-action catalyst to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure a more resilient and livable climate future. The law is galvanizing a clean energy transformation and puts the U.S. within reach of its commitments under the Paris Agreement. We must use this moment to leverage our accomplishments to raise the bar higher." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Mustafa Santiago Ali, Executive Vice President, National Wildlife Federation: "The climate crisis's toll is measured in lives lost, homes and businesses destroyed, and communities upended — and its costs are felt first and worst by frontline communities. One year ago, the president and Congress said enough is enough by passing the historic Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act is a foundation that we need to build upon — and it demonstrates how the best solutions lift up all communities, create opportunity for working- and middle-class families, and address the persistent and pernicious pollution that is harming so many Black, Latinx, Indigenous, rural, and lower-wealth white communities."8/16/23]
Peter Zalzal, EDF's Associate Vice President for Clean Air Strategies: "The American electric vehicle manufacturing renaissance is booming, driven by historic federal investments," said Peter Zalzal, EDF's Associate Vice President for Clean Air Strategies. "On its first birthday, the Inflation Reduction Act is spurring huge increases in EV manufacturing investments and tens of thousands of jobs for Americans in communities across the country. We must continue working collaboratively to maximize these vital benefits for everyone." [Press Release, 8/16/23]
Manish Bapna, President and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): "No law in recent memory has brought this much ambition to a challenge this urgent and begun with this much promise. One year on, it has sparked a heartland manufacturing renaissance with clean energy at its core, creating tens of thousands of jobs in red states and blue. It's strengthening the supply chain for the building blocks of a modern economy. It's positioned the country for dramatic cuts in the carbon pollution that's driving the climate crisis. As millions swelter in record heat, coral reefs bleach in 100-degree seas, and wildfire smoke blots out the sun, a summer of cascading climate disasters makes all too clear the need to build on these gains, not retreat from them." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen: "The Inflation Reduction Act is supercharging our clean energy transition and tackling the climate crisis head-on by funding a new green economy. By spurring investments in communities across the county, this legislation is making a brighter future possible in every state across this country. Ensuring that everyone benefits from the IRA also means the transformational investments must benefit clean energy without expanding fossil fuel infrastructure and dependence. Our children and grandchildren are relying on our ability to meet this moment. We must continue to fight against attacks from congressional Republicans that would undermine progress and jeopardize our planet and their futures." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Bob Keefe, E2 Executive Director of the National Nonpartisan Business Group: "I just visited some of the electric vehicle, solar panel, and battery factories popping up throughout the country, and I can tell you definitively we're in the middle of an American economic revolution like we haven't seen in generations, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies. With the economic costs of climate change rising like a thermometer in July, this made-in-America clean energy boom couldn't come at a better time." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations, Ceres: "One year after its passage, the Inflation Reduction Act has underpinned a stunning clean energy boom that is powering a U.S. manufacturing revitalization. It goes to show why smart companies and investors long sought this kind of federal climate investment: not only will it lower the risk of dangerous pollution and climate disasters that present immense risk to our economy, but it provides a robust foundation to grow the U.S. economy for decades to come."

Leslie Dach, Chair, Protect Our Care: "Last year, the lives of millions of seniors and families changed forever when President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. By passing this historic legislation, Democrats took on Big Pharma and won to finally give people across the country peace of mind knowing they can afford the lifesaving care they need. The Inflation Reduction Act is already allowing families to sleep easier at night knowing they can go to the doctor without worrying about how they're going to put food on the table or pay rent." [Statement, 8/16/23]
David Mitchell, Founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs (P4AD) and author of Op-Ed: "The Biden administration is defending the law and the will of the people.

Other Advocacy Groups
The Washington Center for Equitable Growth: "One year ago today, the #InflationReductionAct was signed into law. With $430 billion for combating climate change, lowering healthcare costs and tax reform, the #IRA was a research-rooted investment in broadly-shared growth. Let's look at some evidence behind the landmark law… The #IRA included $300B for clean energy and climate reform. This will help mitigate the economic effects of climate change, which research shows has an inequitable impact on middle- and lower-income households—disproportionately families of color. It also raised taxes on megacorporations & stock buybacks, and increased funding for anti-tax evasion efforts." [Tweet, 8/16/23]
Patrick Gaspard, President and CEO, Center for American Progress: "The Inflation Reduction Act is the most consequential health care law in more than a decade, the most significant economic legislation in a generation, and the most impactful climate change bill ever. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, millions of Americans have more affordable prescriptions and health coverage, more than 170,000 workers will have new jobs, and generations of Americans, many not yet born, will breathe cleaner air. At just a year old, the full promise of the Inflation Reduction Act is still to be realized. But through the clean energy jobs it has created and the money it's saving American families, it's already living up to its potential of growing the economy by growing the middle class." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Economic Policy Institute: "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law a year ago this week. It is widely seen as the crown jewel of the "industrial policy" agenda of the Biden administration. While no piece of legislation is perfect, the full potential of the IRA to deliver a radically better future is often underrated. In this post, we highlight many of the IRA's huge steps forward and also talk about the unfinished agenda for securing faster, fairer, and greener growth in the U.S. economy." [Blogpost, 8/14/23]
Economic Policy Institute: "Put simply, the IRA puts the U.S. on a path where meeting its global climate change commitments is within reach—commitments which would provide a genuine chance at securing a livable planet for future generations if they are kept. At the beginning of August 2022, there was no such path to secure this livable future, but there is now—and that is a mammoth victory." [Blogpost, 8/14/23]
Dr. Rakeen Mabud, Chief Economist, Groundwork Collaborative: "After 40 years of failed trickle-down economics, the Inflation Reduction Act is a case study for what is possible when we invest in the workers and families who power our economy. Just one year in and the IRA is already delivering jobs and growing wages, pushing down the cost of prescription drugs and energy, and creating a blueprint for a more resilient and sustainable economy."

Todd Tucker, Director of Industrial Policy and Trade, Roosevelt Institute: "One Year into the Inflation Reduction Act: Significant Benefits Unlocked, and What Comes Next…Companies are responding to something, and that something is new industrial policies. Indeed, the tally of total direct public and induced private investment keeps ticking upwards. These investments will certainly shift the composition of industries in the country away from the speculative and towards the productive…There's lots to celebrate." [Tweet, 8/16/23]
Todd Tucker, Director of Industrial Policy and Trade, Roosevelt Institute: "Today, August 16, 2023, marks one year since the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden administration's signature legislation to fight the climate crisis, lower drug prices, and ensure corporations pay what they owe in taxes. In the decade to come, implementation of this law will shape US markets and livelihood in ways that will ripple for generations… While there is more to be done, the IRA is a key part of Bidenomics' effort to rebalance power in our economy, by embracing the role that government can play to create and shape the markets and industries our country needs to thrive." [Blogpost, 8/16/2023]
Mayra Macias, Interim Executive Director, Building Back Together: "Just one year after President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, this historic legislation is already making a massive impact for families all across the country. From allowing Medicare to negotiate the costs of prescription medications, to investing in U.S. energy manufacturing, this historic legislation is already lowering day-to-day costs and providing middle-class families with much-needed relief. Yet despite the Inflation Reduction Act's major investments in local economies and our families, every single Republican in Congress voted against it." [Statement, 8/16/23]
Elizabeth Reynolds, MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning: "The IRA is the most significant investment the country has made in terms of addressing climate change…I would just emphasize that we're all part of making this transition happen. This is a transformational moment. It sounds technical and it sounds caught up in legislation and dollars and tax credits. But in the end, we're moving toward a different place. We're going to see, I think, a profound transformation and a real opportunity to put the country on a new trajectory. A trajectory that is addressing our climate concerns, addressing our national economic security. But I would just want people to understand that we're all invested in making this a success."

Liz Zelnick, Director of Economic Security & Corporate Power, Accountable US : "Corporate special interests claimed the sky would fall if they had to finally pay their fair share in taxes.

MoveOn members applaud the leadership of President Biden and Congressional Democrats who refused to let the moment pass last year without taking action.
