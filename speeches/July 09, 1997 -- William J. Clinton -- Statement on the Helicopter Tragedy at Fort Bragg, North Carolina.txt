    I was saddened to learn today that a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter had crashed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, killing all eight soldiers aboard.
Although nothing can ease the pain of this tragic loss, I want to express my deep respect for these patriots who died proudly serving the country they loved. These eight soldiers paid the ultimate price for the peace we all enjoy.
I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of these brave soldiers and ask that all Americans join us in remembering them in our prayers.
