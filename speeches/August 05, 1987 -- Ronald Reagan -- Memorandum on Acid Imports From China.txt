    Memorandum for the United States Trade RepresentativeSubject: Import Relief Determination Under Section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 on Ammonium Paratungstate and Tungstic Acid from the People's Republic of China
Pursuant to sections 406, 202, and 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2436, 2252, and 2253), I have determined the action I will take with respect to the report of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) dated June 5, 1987, concerning the results of its investigation, as requested by the United States Trade Representative, of the domestic industry producing ammonium paratungstate and tungstic acid, provided for in Items 417.40 and 416.40, respectively, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States.
After considering all relevant aspects of the case, including those set forth in section 202(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have determined to provide import relief for the domestic industry. Relief should be granted in the form of a negotiated orderly market agreement.
I therefore direct you to negotiate and conclude an orderly marketing agreement and to report the results of such negotiations not later than 50 days from the date of this determination. If such negotiations are not successful, I direct you to prepare and present to me for signature no later than 60 days from the date of this decision a proclamation imposing quantitative restrictions.
Finally, in view of this determination to provide relief, I direct that a review be completed, within 60 days, regarding relevant plans for the operation of the stockpile for the fiscal years 1988 and 1989.
This determination is to be published in the Federal Register.
