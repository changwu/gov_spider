In-town pool report #10 [DHS statement re: Trump/Cuomo meeting]
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has just issued a statement after POTUS met with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Oval this afternoon.
Wolf described the meeting regarding a federal ban on New Yorkers applying for expedited travel programs as productive and said discussions were ongoing.
In full:
"Today, I joined President Trump and Governor Cuomo for a productive meeting. The relationship between New York State and the Federal government is very important but has been made difficult by the unilateral actions of New York State regarding the sharing of critical security information with DHS."
"New York is the only State that restricts CBP access to their data across the board -- from law enforcement, customs, trade and travel facilitation purposes. Despite that, we will continue discussions with the State of New York to find a mutually agreeable solution."
I'll bring you more as I get it.
