    Today, former Cabinet member for President George W. Bush and three-term Utah governor, Mike Leavitt, and former Utah First Lady, Jackie Leavitt, endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America leadership team.
"Governor John Kasich had a decisive and critical win in Ohio," said Leavitt. "I trust his temperament and the tone of his campaign. I worked closely with Governor Kasich over many years and I have witnessed his ability to bring people together to get things done. I think he has the best opportunity to beat Hillary Clinton."

Mike served as the governor of Utah from 1993-2003 and in the Cabinet of President George W. Bush as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Said Kasich, "Mike Leavitt will bring a remarkable depth of conservative policy expertise to our team as we work to stay focused on the issues, fix problems and address the frustrations of the American people. As our momentum grows in Utah, I am grateful for his support."
