    1. Jeb to Trump: Saturday Shows or Sunday Shows?
"I won't get my information from the shows. I don't know if that is Saturday morning or Sunday morning. I don't know which one. I will seek out the best advice and I will create a strategy and I will persuade the American people what the role of America should be."

2. Jeb: Trump a Chaos Candidate, Would Be a Chaos President
"So, Donald, you know, is great at the one liners. But he's a chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the Commander-in-Chief we need to keep our country safe."

3. Jeb to Trump: You're Not Going To Be Able To Insult Your Way to the Presidency
"Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency. That's not going to happen."

4. Jeb Destroys Trump's Foreign Policy Failures
"This is another example of the lack of seriousness…Look, two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight — just two months ago. He said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows. That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security."

5. Jeb Shuts Down Trump
"I'm talking."
