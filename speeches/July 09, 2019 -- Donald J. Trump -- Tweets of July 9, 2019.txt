The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy. He should speak to his country and Prime Minister May about their failed Brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was...Retweets: 20653Favorites: 98421

...handled. I told @theresa_may how to do that deal but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster! I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military anywhere in the World by far...Retweets: 14245Favorites: 73563

Recent 'strained' decisions by the United States Supreme Court some so simple as allowing the question 'Are you a citizen of the United States' on our very expensive Census Report or the even more strained decisions (2) allowing the world's most expensive & pathetic......Retweets: 16581Favorites: 75821

....healthcare (Obamacare) to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming 2020 Election is. I have long heard that the appointment of Supreme Court Justices is a President's most important decision. SO TRUE!Retweets: 15128Favorites: 73025
