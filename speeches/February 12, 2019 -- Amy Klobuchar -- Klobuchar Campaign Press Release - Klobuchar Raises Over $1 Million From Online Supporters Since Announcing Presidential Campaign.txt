    Minneapolis, MN â€” Today, the Amy for America presidential campaign announced that they raised over $1 million from online and grassroots supporters across the country in the 48 hours following Senator Klobuchar's announcement in Minneapolis. Less than 20 minutes after the Senator's campaign officially launched on Sunday, she received campaign contributions from every state in the country.
The support Senator Klobuchar received in just the first 48 hours reinforces what she said in her speech Sunday: the campaign is a "homegrown one" straight from the heartland.
