    As I have always said, collective bargaining works, and I congratulate both parties at the ports for reaching an agreement. I want to thank Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su who used her deep experience and judgment to keep the parties talking, working with them to reach an agreement after a long and sometimes acrimonious negotiation. Above all, I congratulate the port workers, who have served heroically through the pandemic and the countless challenges it brought and will finally get the pay, benefits, and quality of life they deserve.
Julie Su has proven herself time and time again, both as Deputy Secretary working closely with Secretary Marty Walsh and now as a leader who helped assure that our supply chains remain strong for America's businesses, farmers, and working families.
