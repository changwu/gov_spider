    Earlier today at the White House, the President signed into law the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, also known as "Kerry-Lugar-Berman."
This law is the tangible manifestation of broad support for Pakistan in the U.S., as evidenced by its bipartisan, bicameral, unanimous passage in Congress.
As President Obama said on March 27, the United States wants to engage Pakistan on the basis of a strategic partnership, "grounded in support for Pakistan's democratic institutions and the Pakistani people." This Act formalizes that partnership, based on a shared commitment to improving the living conditions of the people of Pakistan through sustainable economic development, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, and combating the extremism that threatens Pakistan and the United States.
