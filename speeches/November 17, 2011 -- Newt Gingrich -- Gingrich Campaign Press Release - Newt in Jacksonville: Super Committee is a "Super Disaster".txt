    Jacksonville, FL- In a town hall meeting here today, Newt Gingrich told the the First Coast Tea Party that the super committee could become a "super disaster."
"We are watching the current Congress repeat every mistake the democrats made ramming through an unread stimulus bill and Obamacare," Gingrich said. "Secret negotiations among a handful of members will lead to a gigantic bill no one understands. That bill will then move to an up or down vote with no hearings, no understanding and no amendments."
"We have moved from ‘we the people' to ‘we the insiders' and it is profoundly wrong," added Gingrich.
Earlier this week, some members of Congress called on the Super Committee to "go big" with a $4 trillion "grand bargain."
"I don't want the super committee to go big," said Gingrich. "I want it to go away."
"The idea of a $4 trillion tax and spending bill being rammed through congress with no hearings, no markups, no expert analysis, no citizen participation is exactly wrong," he continued.
Gingrich called for Congress to disband the super committee return to regular order and ask every subcommittee and committee to do their job out in the open, in public, with the understanding and participation of the American people.
