    Gentlemen, I know that you will want to join me in telling Chancellor Erhard how much we appreciate his coming here to the United States at this time.
We meet at a difficult hour, when the usual warmth and peace of the Christmas season and of the coming New Year are tinged with sorrow because of a great loss. We all know that this meeting was to have taken place a month ago and that well-laid plans were changed abruptly by the tragic death of President Kennedy.
But, despite the changes that have taken place, it is my purpose, and I am sure it is the Chancellor's, that the close relationship and healthy friendship that have developed between our countries over the past years will become ever closer, and that through our efforts the United States and the Federal Republic will continue to move together in harmony.
I am confident that under Chancellor Erhard's wise leadership, the impressive progress made by the Federal Republic in its brief 14 years of existence will continue and the partnership in which both our peoples are actively participating will become an ever greater force for peace and progress. The judgments we make here today will serve us well tomorrow.
Gentlemen, let us drink to the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr. Heinrich Lubke, and the German people.
