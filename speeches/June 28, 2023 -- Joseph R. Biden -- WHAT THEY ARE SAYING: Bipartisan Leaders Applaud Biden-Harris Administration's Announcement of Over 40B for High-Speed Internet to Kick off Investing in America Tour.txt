    On Monday, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that it has allocated over $40 billion to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories to deploy affordable, reliable high-speed Internet service to American families through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program.
Every state received more than $100 million in BEAD allocations, with 19 states receiving more than a billion dollars. This investment is the largest single investment in high-speed internet in history, as well as the largest one-time announcement from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
