    The death this morning of Congressman William Steiger deprives the Congress of a youthful but experienced leader.
Congressman Steiger, the youngest Member of Congress when he was elected in 1966, quickly earned the respect of his colleagues. His energy, independence, and good humor will be sorely missed by the people of Wisconsin and by his colleagues.
Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathies to Congressman Steiger's wife and family on their loss.
