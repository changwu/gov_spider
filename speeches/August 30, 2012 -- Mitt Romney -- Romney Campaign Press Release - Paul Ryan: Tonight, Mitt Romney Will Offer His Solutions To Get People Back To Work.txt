PAUL RYAN: "I'm excited because Mitt Romney's going to finish telling the story that we started telling last night. He's going to introduce himself to the American people so they can get to know the kind of man, the leader that he is, that we know. He's going to offer his solutions to get people back to work."
WOLF BLITZER, CNN: "Is he going to go through specifics like you did last night?
RYAN: "He's going to go into his plan for a stronger middle class. He's going to go into granular detail about these ideas to get people back to work. He's going to talk about how we need real leadership to make key decisions now before we have a debt crisis on our horizon, before we lose grip of the American idea and before we find ourselves in a situation like Europe is facing and he's going to introduce himself to the American people in a way, so that they can get to know him like we do. And I'm excited about seeing that."
