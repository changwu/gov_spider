    Alexandria, VA - In response to Senator Graham's performance in this evening's CNN Reagan Library debate, campaign manager Christian Ferry today released the following statement:
"There was one person on the stage tonight ready to serve as Commander-in-Chief on day one: Lindsey Graham. Like Ronald Reagan facing down the Evil Empire, Lindsey Graham has the uncompromised determination to destroy radical Islam and keep American families safe.
"The most important job of the President of the United States is to be the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military in the world. Tonight, Lindsey Graham showed he is better prepared than any candidate running for president on either side of the aisle. He has a plan to defeat radical Islam and the experience to execute it. Senator Graham has been a near lone voice calling out President Obama for his failed policies and he is singularly prepared to repair the damage that has been done by this administration.
"There is no question that the clear winner of tonight's debate, the person ready to lead on the first day in the Oval Office, is Lindsey Graham."
