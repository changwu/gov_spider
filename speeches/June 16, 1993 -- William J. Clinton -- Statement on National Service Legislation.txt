    I've always said that national service would be America at its best. In reporting out the national service legislation, today two key committees were Congress at its best as well.
National service is not about political partisanship. It is about America and the values that all of us share. National service will do so much that must be done: meeting our country's needs, paying for our children's education, and bringing all of us together in the common work of citizenship.
Democrats and Republicans joined together today in a spirit of service to support this initiative. Senator Ted Kennedy and Representative Bill Ford continued to provide exemplary leadership in moving this legislation forward on a bipartisan basis.
We've known for a long time that national service will bring Americans together. It's good to see that it brings Congress together as well.
