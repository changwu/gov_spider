    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Attached is a report on my decision to take no action to suspend or prohibit the proposed acquisition of Verio, Inc., a large U.S.-based Internet Service Provider (ISP), by NTT Communications Corporation (NTT Communications), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, (NTT). NTT is a Japanese corporation that is owned and controlled by the Government of Japan (GOJ). I have taken this decision under the authority vested in me as President by section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, also known as the "Exon-Florio" provision, 50 U.S.C. App. 2170. This report is submitted pursuant to subsection (g) of the Exon-Florio provision.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
