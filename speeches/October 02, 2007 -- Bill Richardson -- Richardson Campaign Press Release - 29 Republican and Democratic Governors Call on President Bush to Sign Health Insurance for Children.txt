    SANTA FE - Governor Bill Richardson joined a bipartisan coalition of governors in a letter to President Bush urging him to sign the legislation to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
"The legislation passed by Congress last week represents a bipartisan consensus and is the solution to ensure states and the federal government meet our moral obligation to care for our youngest and most vulnerable Americans," stated the Governors' letter. "We urge you to join the strong bipartisan consensus among Congress, governors and the American public by signing this legislation into law."

President Bush has threatened to veto the current legislation. The current legislation would continue to cover 6 million children participating in the program and an additional 4 million children without insurance. In New Mexico, SCHIP funding covers children in households with incomes up to 235% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which equates to $39,036 annual income for a family of three.
