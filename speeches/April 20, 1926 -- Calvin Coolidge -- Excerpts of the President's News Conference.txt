    Congressman Treadway was in the other day to suggest two places in Stockbridge—I think one is the Woodward place—that is the Woodward that was connected with the Woodward and Lothrop Store here in Washington, and the Patterson place on the Lee-Lennox road—as possible places for me to occupy during the summer. I have taken those under consideration and of course have a good many places offered. I am very glad to have the press report on all of them. While I can't occupy more than one place during the summer, it is very nice to have brought to the general public's attention the availability of all these different localities for other people that are seeking places to go during the summertime.
CHARLIE MICHAELS: Would they get such good rates?
