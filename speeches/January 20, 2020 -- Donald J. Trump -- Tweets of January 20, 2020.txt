They didn't want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!Retweets: 20308Favorites: 105995

Cryin' Chuck Schumer is now asking for "fairness", when he and the Democrat House members worked together to make sure I got ZERO fairness in the House. So, what else is new?Retweets: 26691Favorites: 130235

It was exactly three years ago today, January 20, 2017, that I was sworn into office. So appropriate that today is also MLK jr DAY.
