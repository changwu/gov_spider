    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating the Sudan emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 2003, to the Federal Register for publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register on October 31, 2002 (67 Fed. Reg. 66525).
The crisis between the United States and Sudan constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency on November 3, 1997, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to Sudan and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions against Sudan to respond to this threat.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, October 29, 2003.
