    Memorandum for the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, Administrator, Small Business Administration, and Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers
I have today decided upon a program to assist the domestic non-rubber footwear industry to become more efficient. The goals of the program are threefold: to help the industry become more competitive; to support the industry in the development of new business opportunities; and to provide jobs for affected workers.
I am charging the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of Labor and the Special Trade Representative, with the responsibility of ensuring effective use of the resources available under existing law for the benefit of the non-rubber footwear industry, its workers and the communities in which non-rubber footwear plants are located, including, where necessary, developing alternative employment opportunities for the affected workers. It is imperative that your Department or Agency give its full assistance to these efforts.
I am also ordering the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor and the Special Trade Representative to conduct a full review of the Government's trade adjustment assistance programs. This review will examine the means by which Government can encourage the revitalization of trade-impacted industries through technological support and guidance, data and market research, and marketing and promotion services.
The review should also focus on the improvements in the administration and organization of adjustment assistance; the removal of impediments to effective adjustment assistance that can be accomplished under existing law; and the exploration of new legislative initiatives. Within the next 90 days, I will present a comprehensive trade adjustment assistance program, including any legislation which may be warranted.
This effort will require your Department or Agency's full cooperation and support if effective proposals are to be developed.
