    Today, former Wisconsin Senator Herb Kohl released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States. While working together in the Senate, I saw up close his sheer honesty, uncompromising integrity, and unwavering dedication to public service. As Vice President, Joe always worked intelligently and compassionately to bring people together around common goals and values. Our country needs those qualities now more than ever. During my time in the Senate, I believed I had a special responsibility to look out for working families. As President, Joe will bring a deep commitment to those same values. He is our strongest candidate to win in Wisconsin, take back the White House and restore the soul of our country."
