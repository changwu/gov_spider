    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 5305 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby report on the pay adjustment I ordered for the Federal statutory pay systems in October 1979 and March 1980.
The Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, who serve jointly as my agent for Federal pay, found that an overall average increase of 10.41 percent in General Schedule rates of pay would be appropriate if comparability with private enterprise salary rates for the same levels of work were to be achieved. The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay recommended that the findings of my agent be implemented.
After considering the findings of my agent and the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, I determined that an overall average increase of 7.02 percent in General Schedule rates of pay was dictated by economic conditions affecting the general welfare and transmitted to the Congress the alternative plan to that effect called for by section 5305(c) of title 5 of the United States Code. On October 9, 1979 and March 12, 1980, I signed the necessary Executive orders to implement this increase.
I am transmitting herewith copies of the reports of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, the alternative plan, and the Executive orders I promulgated to put this pay adjustment into effect.
