    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Eagleton (D) Missouri and 3 others)
The Administration opposes S. 259 because it would:
— impose a burdensome regulatory scheme in connection with the granting of an antitrust exemption for sports leagues to enforce rules concerning team relocations; and
— exempt from the antitrust laws sports league agreements to enforce rules concerning (a) the division of revenues among member clubs and (b) who may be selected to own or continue to own a sports team.
