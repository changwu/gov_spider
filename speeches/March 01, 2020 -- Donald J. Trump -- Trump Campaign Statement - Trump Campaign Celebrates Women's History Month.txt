    As we begin the observance of Women's History Month in March, Lara Trump, Senior Advisor for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., issued the following statement.
"Women have always played a vital role in American history. As we kick off Women's History Month, we remember the many ways that women have helped make America great since our founding as a nation â€“ including the women's suffrage movement and achievements in civil rights, education, science, sports, space exploration, and so much more. With women's unemployment reaching a near 70-year low and women filling 71% of the new jobs created under President Trump's leadership in 2019 alone, we look ahead with optimism while also commemorating the women in our history who fought for our freedoms and worked hard to ensure America would become the greatest nation on earth."
