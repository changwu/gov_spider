    President Obama had the opportunity to engage with Chilean President Sebastian Piñera during the Global Nuclear Security Summit on a range of issues on the bilateral, hemispheric and global agendas. The President thanked President Piñera for Chile's recently completed removal of all highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Chile and commended Chilean leadership in promoting nuclear non-proliferation and for working with us to achieve a successful Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference next month.
The Presidents agreed to work together to advance respect for shared values, including democratic governance, human rights, economic prosperity, and social inclusion throughout the Americas. Finally, the President renewed the U.S. offer to support Chile's ongoing recovery efforts following the February 27 earthquake should the Chilean government request further assistance.
