    To the Commissioners and Staff of the Federal Trade Commission
I know that the past several months have been trying for all of you and that the uncertainty arising from the protracted effort to secure an authorization bill has made your jobs much more difficult than they otherwise might be. I am acutely aware of your predicament. You have my support and you can be assured that I will continue my efforts on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission.
Last week I invited the senior House and Senate conferees to the White House in an effort to help resolve the issue that divided them. Solid progress was made in that meeting, and we have continued working closely with the conferees to get a bill that ensures the Commission's ability to protect the consumers of this country.
At long last, the conferees have reached agreement on an authorization bill. As a result, we are now able to work with members of the Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate to enact the legislation necessary to permit the Commission to resume normal operations.
I remain firmly committed to an effective Federal Trade Commission. I hope to be able to soon sign legislation that will enable you to return to your important work.
JIMMY CARTER
