    On Friday, February 27, President Obama will welcome President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia to the White House. President Sirleaf's visit comes at a time of critical cooperation between the United States and Liberia. As President Obama announced last week, the United States is moving to the next phase of its Ebola response, which will be characterized by an intensive effort to reach zero Ebola cases in West Africa. The President looks forward to building on a strong and historic partnership with Liberia and discussing a range of topics with President Sirleaf, including the ongoing Ebola response, the region's economic recovery plans, and other issues of mutual interest.
