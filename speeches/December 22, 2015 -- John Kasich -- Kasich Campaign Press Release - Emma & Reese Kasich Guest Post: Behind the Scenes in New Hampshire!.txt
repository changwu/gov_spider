    This week, we traveled to New Hampshire to campaign for our dad. Our friends Megan and Abby tagged along and we traveled around the state on the campaign bus. We didn't really know what to expect, but the people we met were really nice and encouraging.
In town halls, TV studios, restaurants and the campaign bus, we had the opportunity to talk to people about why our dad would be an incredible president. Our dad likes to say that campaigning is hard work—it's not all glamorous. That's true, but we still thought it was pretty cool!
We could tell you more about our trip, but we'd rather show you. Here are our favorite behind-the-scenes shots from New Hampshire.
We brought plenty of blankets to stay cozy on the bus...
