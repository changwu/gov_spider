    The United States congratulates the Egyptian people and government for holding Egypt's first multi-candidate Presidential elections on September 7. This election represents an important step toward holding fully free and fair competitive multi-party elections, and both supporters and opponents of the government have told us that it has occasioned a vigorous national debate in Egypt on important issues. We expect it will be part of a process of continuing political reforms and that the flaws that were visible in this election will be corrected for November's parliamentary election.
The President called President Mubarak this morning to congratulate him on his victory, and say he looks forward to continuing to work with him in the coming years.
