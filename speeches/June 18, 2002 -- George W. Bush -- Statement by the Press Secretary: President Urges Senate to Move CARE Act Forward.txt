    The Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senators Baucus and Grassley, has taken an important step forward by approving bipartisan legislation that assists faith and community based organizations and encourages charitable giving. The Committee's action on the CARE Act creates incentives for charitable donations in order to respond to the tough times faced by many American charities due to the events of September 11. The President urges the Senate to act quickly to pass this common sense legislation, which not only encourages Americans to give, but creates a level playing field for faith and community based organizations that choose to apply for federal grant money to assist their efforts.
