    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Florence, SC, Mayor Frank E. Willis.
"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate I've seen that is stepping up to the plate, saying I will support our cities in America," Willis said. "She has a real feel for what local elected officials are struggling with on a day-to-day basis."
Willis cited Clinton's advocacy of community development block grants and community policing programs as key to his support.
"Senator Clinton is a tremendous supporter of the COPS program," Willis said. "The COPS program put more police on our streets, gave our officers the equipment they need, and in the long run, it made our communities safer. For the last six and a half years we've seen that program cut, year after year. And what has happened? Our crime rates across the country are going up. Senator Clinton will give local elected officials the tools they need to make our communities safer."
Willis has helped spur economic development in the Pee Dee region since he was elected mayor of Florence in 1995, leading efforts to expand the presence of major companies such as Honda and Roche in the region.
A former gubernatorial candidate and business owner, Willis chaired the Florence County Economic Development Authority before his election as mayor. Recognizing the vital role transportation would play in regional economic development, Willis founded the South Carolina Transportation Policy and Research Council in 1980.
"America needs more problem-solving leaders like Mayor Willis, and I'm honored to have his support," Senator Clinton said.
