    His Excellency Dr. Arturo Frondizi President of the Argentine Nation
Thank you for your gracious telegram of farewell and your good wishes which I wholeheartedly reciprocate. You have honored us by your presence in the United States. The warm response which your visit elicited here was a reflection of the strong friendship which we feel toward the Argentine Republic, as well as an impressive tribute to you personally. You may take pride in the impression which you created in the United States as the vigorous leader of a determined and forward-looking nation.
I welcomed this opportunity to get to know you and to learn at first hand your views on matters in which our Governments have a joint and continuing interest as partners in the community of free nations.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
