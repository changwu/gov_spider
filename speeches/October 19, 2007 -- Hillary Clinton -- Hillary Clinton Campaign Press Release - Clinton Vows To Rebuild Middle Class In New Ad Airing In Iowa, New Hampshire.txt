    The Clinton Campaign launched a new television ad in Iowa and New Hampshire today, underscoring Hillary's commitment to strengthen the middle class and chart a new course in Iraq, on health care and on the economy.

The new 30-second spot, entitled "Trapdoor," features Hillary at a townhall discussing the anxieties facing middle class families, many of whom are only a pink slip or a medical emergency away from falling through the trapdoor of the Bush economy.
The latest IRS data reveals an American economy that is leaving more and more middle class families behind. Widening income inequality has reached levels not seen since 1929, and typical taxpayers have found their real income drop 2 percent between 2000 and 2005.
The new ad airs a week after Hillary's "Rebuilding the Road to the Middle Class Tour" across Iowa and New Hampshire, during which she outlined her economic blueprint for the 21st Century to create high-paying jobs, restore fairness to our tax code, and renew the basic American bargain that anyone who works hard and follows the rules can get ahead.
Hillary detailed proposals to offer retirement savings plans for every American and unlock the doors to higher learning by providing generous tax credits to help all young people afford a college education. Read more about Hillary's middle class agenda here.
Following is the script for the ad:
"Trapdoor"TV :30
CLINTON: We have to change course on the economy, just as we have to change course in Iraq and on healthcare.
CLINTON: The Bush economy is like a trapdoor. Too many families are one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment, one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything.
ANNCR: If you're ready for change...she's ready to lead.
CLINTON: We've got to build a strong and prosperous middle class to have a strong and prosperous America again.
CLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
