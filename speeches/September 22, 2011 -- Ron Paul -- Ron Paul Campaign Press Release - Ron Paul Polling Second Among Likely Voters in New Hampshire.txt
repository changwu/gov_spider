    Places far ahead of Rick Perry in Granite State survey
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul placed second in a nonpartisanpoll of likely New Hampshire voters. The poll results demonstrate the emergence, in that state, of a surprise three-way race that omits Texas Governor Rick Perry.
Fourteen percent of respondents chose Dr. Paul, with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney garnering 41 percent of the vote. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman finishes third with 10 percent, followed by Rick Perry with a modest 8 percent.
The poll was conducted by Suffolk University-7News. The Associated Press notes that this survey is the first nonpartisan poll focused on New Hampshire since Perry joined the race almost six weeks ago. The AP also notes that Perry has visited New Hampshire several times and courted key officials.
