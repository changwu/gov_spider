    The President announced today that he will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki after the election to discuss bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual concern, including the automobile import question.
In making the announcement in Saginaw, Mich., the President said that American and Japanese leaders have customarily met after national elections and that his meeting with Prime Minister Suzuki would continue this pattern. He pointed out that while the two leaders have not yet set the time or agenda for this meeting, automobile imports would figure in the discussions. The President said earlier this month that it was his intention to consult with Japanese leaders about the automobile import question soon after the U.S. International Trade Commission rules on the case in November.
The President stressed again the importance of a strong U.S. automobile industry to the Nation's economy and indicated that he has already taken a number of steps to restore the health of this key industry and to enable it to meet competition from abroad. The ITC investigation, already underway, will determine whether imports have caused injury to our domestic industry. The ITC will submit its findings and recommendations to the President in November regarding the possible need for import relief. The President repeated his pledge to take action on those recommendations immediately after receiving them.
