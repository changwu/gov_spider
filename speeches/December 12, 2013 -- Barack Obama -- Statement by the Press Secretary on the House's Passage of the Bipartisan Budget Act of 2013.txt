    The bipartisan agreement passed by the House today represents a positive step forward for the nation and our economy. The President called on Congress to work together on a budget that grows our economy faster, creates more jobs and makes the investments needed to strengthen the middle class, rather than continue reckless across the board cuts that stifle growth. This bill does not include everything the President called for. But it marks an important moment of bipartisan cooperation and shows Washington can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done.
While today's bill is a good first step, there is much more Congress needs to do to ensure our economy works for every American. For one, Congress must act quickly to extend unemployment insurance to prevent Americans from losing a vital economic lifeline this holiday season and avoid an unnecessary hit to our economy. Additionally, Congress must do more to expand broad-based growth and opportunity, by creating more jobs that pay better wages and by offering a path into the middle class for every American willing to work for it.
