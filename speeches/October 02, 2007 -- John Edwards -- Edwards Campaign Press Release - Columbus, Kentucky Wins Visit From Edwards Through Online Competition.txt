    Columbus, Kentucky – On Thursday, October 4th, Senator John Edwards will visit Columbus, Kentucky to meet with residents and answer questions about his plans to change America so that everyone, no matter where they're from, has the opportunity to work hard and get ahead. Columbus, a small town in western Kentucky, won Edwards' visit through an online competition organized by the campaign through the website Eventful.com. Residents from Columbus – population 229 – used Eventful.com to lobby for Edwards' visit, organizing a national effort that generated thousands of votes and successfully outbid competition from more populous communities. Edwards will attend a community barbeque and host a town hall forum with Columbus' residents at the Columbus-Belmont State Park, located on the banks of the Mississippi. After answering questions from residents, Edwards will hold a press availability.
"I am excited by the prospect of meeting the residents of Columbus and hearing what they have to say on the issues that matter most to them," said Edwards. "I grew up in a small rural town, so I've seen firsthand how the problems of rural America too often are forgotten by politicians living and working in far-off capital cities. This campaign is about fighting to change a broken system in Washington and building One America, where every single American, no matter where he or she comes from, has the opportunity to work hard and get ahead."
