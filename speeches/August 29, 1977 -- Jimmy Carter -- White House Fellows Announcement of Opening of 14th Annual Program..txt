    The White House announced today that applications are now available for the White House Fellowship program for 1978-79. The program is seeking to increase the number of applicants from among women, minority groups, union and business careerists, and previously under-represented regions of the country, particularly the Southeast and Southwest.
The White House Fellowship program is beginning its 12th year. It was established by President Lyndon Johnson to give outstanding individuals, early in their careers, a unique, firsthand experience in his administration.
The program is open to all U.S. citizens at least 23 years old, except those in civilian Federal positions. Each Fellow is assigned to a Cabinet officer or senior member of the White House staff and participates in a program including seminars with top Government officials, leading scholars and journalists who deal with the National Government.
President Carter expanded the Commission which runs the program and appointed as its chairman John Gardner, who was among those instrumental in recommending the program to President Johnson. On June 22, President Carter told the 1976-77 and 1977-78 Fellows, "I think it is a rare occasion in our Nation's Government, history, when a man who has a brilliant idea that is innovative and constructive can come back several administrations later and help to keep the vigor and the quality of the program and to observe how it has continued beyond his own concept."
Application forms and additional information can be obtained by sending a post card to the President's Commission on White House Fellowships, Washington, D.C. 20415.
