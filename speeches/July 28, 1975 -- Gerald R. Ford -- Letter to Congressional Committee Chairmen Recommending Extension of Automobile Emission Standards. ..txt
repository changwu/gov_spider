Dear Mr. Chairman:
On June 27th, I transmitted to the Congress a special message which described the conclusions from a detailed executive branch review of the air quality, health, energy, and consumer cost implications of alternative automobile emission standards. I recommended that 1975-76 standards for automobile emissions be extended by the Congress through model year 1981.
I believe it important that the Congress and the public have a full opportunity to hear in detail the findings of our studies and the basis for my conclusions that existing standards should be continued. I recognize that the hearings held by your subcommittee on auto emissions ended before our studies were completed. I urge you to hold another hearing on this matter so Administration witnesses can present the findings.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
