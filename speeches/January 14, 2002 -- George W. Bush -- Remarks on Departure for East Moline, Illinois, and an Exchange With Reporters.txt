    President's Health
The President. My mother always said when you're eating pretzels, chew before you swallow. Listen to your mother. I feel greatâ€”looking forward to a good trip.
Q. What happened?
The President. I hit the deck and woke up, and there was Barney and Spot showing a lot of concern. I didn't realize what happened until I looked in the mirror and my glasses cut my side of my face.
I feel great. I had good blood pressure last night, good blood pressure this morning.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Yes, yes. Anyway, going to have a great trip. Good to see you all.
