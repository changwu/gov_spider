    I am very saddened to learn of the tragic deaths that have occurred as a result of on-going flooding in northern Thailand. This disaster, which has already claimed more than 100 lives, is particularly cruel because it occurred during a holiday weekend, when many Thais had traveled to their hometowns and villages. The American people join me in sending our condolences to all those in Thailand who have lost loved ones, suffered injury or other loss as a result of the flooding. Our sympathy for the Thai people at this difficult time is heightened by our common experience with recent flooding, casualties, and destruction.
The United States stands ready to assist the Royal Thai Government and the Thai people to respond to the effects of the flooding. Our Embassy in Bangkok is in the process of providing emergency support, through the Thai Red Cross, to the initial relief efforts. I hope that our assistance, and the lasting friendship of the United States with the Royal Thai Government and the Thai people, will be helpful as Thailand works to overcome the tragic effects of the flooding.
