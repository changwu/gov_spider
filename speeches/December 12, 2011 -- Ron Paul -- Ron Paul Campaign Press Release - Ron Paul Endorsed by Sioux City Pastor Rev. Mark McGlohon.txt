    Rev. McGlohon calls Dr. Paul "a man of faith"
ANKENY, Iowa â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced today that Sioux City, Iowa pastor Reverend Mark McGlohon has publicly endorsed Dr. Paul.
"Ron Paul is the only candidate who understands the challenges we face as a nation. We need a man like Dr. Paul to put an end to politics as usual and tell the truth even when it is unpopular," said Rev. McGlohon, a former businessman and now minister living in Sioux City.
Rev. Mark McGlohon began his ministry after almost 20 years in the private sector. Ordained by The Calvary Baptist Church in 1998, he spent the next four years as a chaplain in Savannah, Georgia. Rev. McGlohan arrived in Sioux City eight years ago to assume the role of senior pastor of Bethel Baptist Church.
"I believe Dr. Paul is the right person to be president. He is a man of faith and it is his faith that will guide him in leading our country," added Rev. McGlohon.
Rev. McGlohon is a member of the American Association of Christian Counselors and is also a Spiritual Care and Bereavement Counselor for Care Initiatives Hospice. In making his endorsement, the reverend mentioned he was not necessarily speaking on behalf of his congregation.
If ministering in Iowa, local pastors interested in discussing an endorsement are invited email the Iowa Director of Voter Outreach, Meghann Walker, at meghannw@ronpaul2012.com.
