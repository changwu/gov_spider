    Warren Rudman's passion for public service was clear to anyone who met him. He was a tenacious prosecutor, a courageous combat infantry commander, and a devoted Senator. He knew as much about the federal budget as anyone who ever served in this town â€“ and it was always a privilege to work with him, and learn from him. I was proud to call him a close personal friend and confidant. He never let politics stand in the way of doing what was right, and that's why he had the absolute respect of Republicans and Democrats alike. Today, our thoughts and prayers are with all of Warren's family and friends.
