    "In 2012, the Sandy Hook Elementary School community suffered an unthinkable tragedy – and seven years later, the federal government has still not responded, even as more schools and public places have become the sites of shootings. Today we renew our commitment to honoring the victims of Sandy Hook and all Americans who have experienced the devastation of gun violence by fighting to save others from the same fate. Every day that America's kids feel unsafe in their schools and neighborhoods, we're failing them. I've made ending the gun violence epidemic a big part of my life's work. We've made some progress in states around the country – but national change requires national leadership in Washington."
