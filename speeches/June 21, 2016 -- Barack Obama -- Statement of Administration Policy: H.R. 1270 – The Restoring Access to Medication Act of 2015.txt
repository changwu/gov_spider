(House Rules)
(Rep. Jenkins, R-KS, and 39 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1270, which would create new and unnecessary tax breaks that disproportionately benefit high-income people, increase taxes for low- and middle-income people, and do nothing to improve the quality of or address the underlying cost of health care.
The Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health care system. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million more Americans have health insurance. And under the Affordable Care Act, we have seen the slowest growth in health care prices in 50 years, benefiting all Americans.
H.R. 1270 would repeal the Affordable Care Act's provisions that limit the use of flexible savings accounts for over-the-counter drugsâ€”provisions that help fund the law's coverage improvements and expansions. The bill also would provide additional tax breaks that disproportionately benefit those with higher income by expanding tax-preferred health savings accounts. These changes would do little to reduce health care costs or improve quality. To fund these new high-income tax breaks, H.R. 1270 would increase taxes paid by low- and middle-income families by removing the law's limit on repayment of premium tax credits available through the Health Insurance Marketplaces.
Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs.
If the President were presented with H.R. 1270, he would veto the bill.
