Taylor, DeWine, Yost and Faber Will Serve as Statewide Co-Chairs
Today Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced that Ohio's top Republican leaders have endorsed his campaign for President and are coming together to lead his campaign in Ohio. Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, Attorney General Mike DeWine, Auditor of State David Yost and Ohio Senate President Keith Faber will serve as Co-Chairs of Kasich's Ohio campaign team.
Ohio's 2016 primary election is March 15, together with, at this point, Florida, Illinois and Missouri.
"I'm proud of what Ohioans have done to get our state back on track and by what our Administration and statewide and legislative leaders have done to create the environment for them to succeed. It's an incredible success story and shows the country the great things that can happen when leaders put aside their differences and instead put those they serve first. It's certainly a message that Washington needs to hear and I'm so humbled that the leaders who helped make it possible are coming together and, as a team, working with me to take Ohio's successful model to the White House so Americans can begin turning around our nation," said Kasich.
Ohio Secretary of State John Husted has also endorsed Kasich for President but his role as Ohio's chief elections official prevents his involvement.
