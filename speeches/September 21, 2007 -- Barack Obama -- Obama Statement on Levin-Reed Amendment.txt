    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama released the following statement today on the Levin-Reed Amendment.
"It is a sad day for America when the United States Senate once again fails to vote to bring this war to a responsible end. The Levin-Reed amendment offers a responsible course to bring our troops out of Iraq, with a hard date to begin our drawdown and a hard date to complete it. I will continue to press my colleagues to turn the page on a war that should never have been fought. I will continue to insist that George Bush be denied the blank check he needs to continue this war. We also need to turn the page on a politics that puts divisive distractions ahead of the interests of the American people. It's time to leave behind the political posturing so that we can come together as Americans to end this war."
