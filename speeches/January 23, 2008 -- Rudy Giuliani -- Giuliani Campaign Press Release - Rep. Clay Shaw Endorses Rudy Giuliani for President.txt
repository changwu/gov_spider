    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that former U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw has endorsed Rudy Giuliani for President. Shaw represented Florida's 22nd Congressional District from 1981 until 2007.
"I have long admired Rudy's dedication to conservative fiscal principles," said Shaw. "As Mayor, he cut taxes, turned deficits into surpluses and created economic growth in New York City. Republicans need Mayor Giuliani's strong leadership and his commitment to keeping taxes low and restraining government spending."
"Congressman Shaw is a strong conservative who has a record of standing up for issues important to Florida voters," said Mayor Giuliani. "I am honored to have his support. His experience is a great addition to our campaign."
Shaw will campaign with Mayor Giuliani and the Florida Leadership Team on Thursday in Boca Raton.
