On what he thinks should be done about mass shootings:

What I know is this: Many of the proposals that are out there on gun control would not have prevented that attack or some of the others we've seen in the past. Unfortunately, in the cases of mental illness, or the case of someone who just wants a gun to commit a crime, they're not going to follow the law. . . .
We need to start examining why it is people are taking violent action, not what they're using to commit the violent act. We have two issues in this country: One is mental illness, which we need to begin to address more seriously, as opposed to stigmatizing or it in some cases trying to put it aside. That's a societal thing we need to confront as a society and a country.
The other of course is why have we become so violent as individuals. What is it that's leading people in this country who are not mentally ill to do the sort of drive-by shootings and things that we've seen? . . .
The guns are what they're using to commit the violence. In many cases, the laws that are actually being proposed would not have prevented them.
