WH in-town pool report — #1 — VP pool note 
Good morning from the White House. A member of the vice president's press pool tested positive for COVID-19 this morning and so the POTUS pool is covering today's swearing in ceremony.
Your pool is in position at EEOB.
A note from the Office of President Biden:
This morning, a member of the Vice President's press pool tested positive for COVID-19 during routine screening. As soon as we were notified, we disbanded the Vice President's pool and sent them home. They will be tested again tomorrow. Out of an abundance of caution, we made arrangements for the briefing room to be cleaned. We have also begun the process of contract tracing. This individual did not have any contact with the Vice President or White House staff.

WH in-town pool report #12 – more quotes and a photo 
See below more full quotes from the president's brief interaction with the press. Please double check these quotes yourself, as the audio is a bit muffled due to mask use and distancing.
"The last year has shown some of the vulnerability we have with some of the supply chains, including the PPE we needed badly, but had to go abroad to get. And there are current strategies."
He held up what seemed to be an automotive semiconductor chip and said they would be talking about them.
"John Cornyn and the bipartisan group here put together an effort last year that I think is a pretty good effort on how to deal with these chips," POTUS said.

WH in-town pool report #13 – gaggle with Cornyn and McCaul 
Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas gaggled with reporters outside the West Wing after emerging from their meeting with the president and vice president around 3:10 pm ET.
They both said the meeting was positive.
"The president was very receptive, as was the vice president," Cornyn said. "He said, 'we're all in.' We all understand this is important, not only to our economy, but to our national security, because these cutting edge, high-end semiconductors – they operate on everything from the F-35 fifth generation stealth fighter to our cell phones. So it was very positive."
Cornyn noted that China is currently building 17 semiconductor fabrication manufacturing facilities, while the United States is in the early stages of building a single facility in Arizona.
He said that, with the CHIPS for America Act, work on increasing high-end semiconductor production is "shovel-ready," and hence was the focus of the Oval Office meeting.
The COVID-19 relief package known as the American Rescue Plan did not come up in the meeting, Cornyn said.
"I want to commend the president for making this a priority," said McCaul. "When I talked to Secretary of State Blinken, the national security advisor Jake Sullivan, the president, the vice president – they get this, that we've got to focus on decoupling our supply chain from the Chinese Communist Party, particularly on medical, on rare earth minerals, but semiconductors as well."
"It signaled to me from the president of the United States that this is a high priority," McCaul continued, praising the president for raising the matter "within the first four weeks of his presidency."
