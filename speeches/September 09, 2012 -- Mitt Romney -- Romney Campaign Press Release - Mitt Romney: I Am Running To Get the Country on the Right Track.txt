We have to strengthen the foundation of our economy, of our values, of our principles, so we have a military that is so strong we can defend freedom for ourselves and for others. We've got to put Americans back to work and politics and whether I am highly favored or not highly favored just doesn't enter the equation." â€“ Mitt Romney
