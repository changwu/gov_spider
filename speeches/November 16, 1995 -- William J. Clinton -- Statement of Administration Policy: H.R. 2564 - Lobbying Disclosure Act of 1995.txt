    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Canady (R) Honda and 11 cosponsors)
The Administration supports H.R. 2564, Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. as reported by the House Judiciary Committee.
H.R. 2564, as reported by the House Judiciary Committee, is identical to S. 1060, a measure approved 98-0 by the Senate earlier this year. The President has strongly supported the purpose and principles embodied in these measures since the beginning of his Administration. In his first days in office, the President barred all top executive branch officials from lobbying their agencies for five years after leaving office, and from ever lobbying for foreign governments. The Administration repealed the tax loophole that let lobbyists deduct their expenses and the Administration also lent strong support to Congressional reformers, in the 103rd Congress, who shepherded the legislation that served as the model for HR. 2564 and S. 1060.
The Administration notes that the Justice Department has identified in separate correspondence certain provisions in the bill that raise constitutional concerns and that the Department recommended be amended or eliminated before final passage.
The Administration is strongly opposed to efforts to amend the Ml in ways that would launch a broad attack on the right to free speech of such organizations as the Red Cross and the GM Scouts. Such efforts would limit their ability, and that of other organizations that receive Federal funds, to participate in administrative or judicial proceedings. Controversial and divisive approaches such as this should not stand in the way of meaningful lobbying reform. We and the American public have waited too long for reform of the system. Such language would be unacceptable and the President would be forced to veto the bill if it is included.
