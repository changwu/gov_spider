    Thank you so very much. What a fantastic welcome back. Maybe you didn't read the election returns; it didn't work out quite the way we wanted. This is a fantastic return home, and it gives me a chance to just say thank you all so very much. I know most in one way or another have worked here and contributed to this administration of which I will always be extraordinarily proud.
I see some leaders here from the Congress. I especially want to thank Bob Dole. If you heard him last night, that was a class act. We have a great Cabinet, great top officials, and then everybody else helping out there. It means so much to Barbara and me.
Now we will go inside, start readjusting. But you have given us a marvelous lift. And let me just say about the guy standing next to me, we are so grateful to Dan Quayle for everything he did. The guy almost killed himself out there, hard work day in and day out, and what he wasn't doing Marilyn was. And so was Barbara Bush. So, I think we owe all of them a great vote.
But I can think of nothing other to say than say let's finish this job with style. Let's get the job done, cooperate fully with the new administration. The Government goes on, as well it should, and we will support the new President and give him every chance to lead this country into greater heights.
So, I am very grateful to all of you. It's been a wonderful 4 years, and nobody can take that away from any of us. It's been good and strong, and I think we've really contributed something to the country. And maybe history will record it that way.
Thank you all very, very much.
