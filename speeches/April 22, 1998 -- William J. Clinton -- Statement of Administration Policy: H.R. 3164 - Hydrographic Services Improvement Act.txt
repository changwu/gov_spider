    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Saxton (R) New Jersey and 2 cosponsors)
The Administration would support House passage of H.R. 3164 if it were amended to address satisfactorily the Administration's concerns. These concerns include the following:

Subsection 4(d)(2)(B) should be deleted because fees should completely pay for hydrographic services without funds from other sources.


Section 4(c) should be amended to clarify that the United States will not be liable for any negligence of persons that produce hydrographic products. This can be accomplished by striking the clause "if that liability is based solely on certification of such data or product under subsection (b)".


Section 2(4)(A) should be clarified by adding "for waters of the United States and its Territories and Possessions," after "charts,".


Section 3(a)(7) should be clarified to distinguish between participation by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in developing international standards and NOAA's implementation of those standards in NOAA products and services.
