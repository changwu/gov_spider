    Lynchburg, VA â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee announced the personal endorsement of Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. Falwell is the son of the late Jerry Falwell, founder of Liberty University and Falwell Ministries.
"I knew Jerry's dad for more than 30 years and have admired the long tradition of Liberty University and the legacy for creating 'Champions for Christ'," Huckabee said. "Dr. Falwell's vision of helping students to start with nothing to believe they can change the world is exactly what our campaign is all about."
Jerry Falwell, Jr. graduated from Liberty University and later obtained his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. He has served as General Counsel of Liberty University, Thomas Road Baptist Church, Liberty Broadcasting Network, and Jerry Falwell Ministries. In 2003, he was named Vice-Chancellor of the University and was later named President of the University.
Liberty University was founded by Dr. Jerry Falwell in 1971 and prides itself as producing graduates with the values, knowledge, and skills required to impact the world. The 4,400-acre campus serves over 20,000 students from across the globe.
This endorsement comes one-day after Huckabee announced the formation of his Faith and Family Values Coalition, a team of 30 faith leaders who will join Huckabee in reaching out to Christian and social conservatives across the country. The team will also assist and advise Huckabee on policy issues that affect families and the faith community.
This is a personal endorsement and does not reflect the organizations Jerry Falwell Jr. represents.
