Q. Mr. President, some months ago the Indianapolis School Board had written to you requesting that you help along with the school desegregation plan. Do you have any word for them as yet?
THE PRESIDENT.

Q. Mr. President, what do you think the chances are of winning the nomination on the first ballot?
