    President Donald J. Trump called on Congress in May to end surprise medical billing and delivered his principles to Capitol Hill. The Administration applauds the bipartisan efforts of House and Senate members since then to move toward ending an unfair practice that causes confusion and concern for millions of Americans. This compromise reflects the input of doctors and hospitals and is the result of months of delicate work to reach a deal among congressional members and the White House that protects patients. Americans should not be surprised with huge medical bills when they are most vulnerable. We are hopeful Congress will focus on this important issue and act this year and send legislation to the President to sign into law.
