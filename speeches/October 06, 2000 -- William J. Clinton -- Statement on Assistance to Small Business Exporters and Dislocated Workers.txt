    I am pleased to sign an Executive order today creating a small business exports task force to help small businesses, especially those in underserved communities, participate fully in the benefits of the new trading arrangements Congress approved this year with China, Africa, and the Caribbean Basin. This order will also expand the Federal Government's outreach to workers and communities eligible for dislocated-worker assistance, helping them to learn about and take advantage of these benefits more rapidly. I thank Representative Sheila Jackson Lee for working so closely with my administration in developing this Executive order and for championing efforts to translate our expanding trade and dynamic, new economy into opportunities for small businesses and workers all across America.
