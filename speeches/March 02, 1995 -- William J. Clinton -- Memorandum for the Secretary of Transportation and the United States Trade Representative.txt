    Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. 10922(l) (1) and (2), I hereby extend for an additional 2 years both the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. This action preserves the status quo and will maintain the moratorium through September 19, 1996, unless earlier revoked or modified.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
