    Lowenthal Named CA Co-Chair of Asian American and Pacific Islanders for Hillary
The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of Long Beach City Councilmember Suja Lowenthal, and named her California Co-Chair for Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for Hillary. Lowenthal cited Clinton's commitment to providing quality, affordable universal health care as a reason for her backing.
"I support Hillary Clinton because she has been a longtime advocate for universal health care," said Lowenthal. "She has the experience we need in the White House to fix our nation's broken health care system, and I am excited to work to ensure she is elected as the next President."
Councilmember Suja Lowenthal was sworn in as Second District Councilmember of the City of Long Beach on June 27, 2006. In 2001, Suja was elected to represent the 3rd District of the Board of Education in Long Beach Unified School District. During Suja's tenure as President of the District in 2003-04, Long Beach Unified School District was recognized as the best urban school district in the nation by the Broad Foundation. The award is given annually to a school district that has made the greatest strides in narrowing educational achievement gaps across ethnic groups and between high and low-income students.
"I am honored to have the backing of Councilmember Lowenthal," said Clinton. "As President, I will work closely with city leaders and ensure a strong partnership between the Federal and municipal governments for the betterment of our cities and residents."
