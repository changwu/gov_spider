Good morning from JBA, I'll be your print pooler today for Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to Atlanta. It's a windy 41 degrees here on the tarmac.

We'll be wheels up shortly.

VPOTUS Pool Report No. 8 - color from Emory's Quad
VPOTUS remains inside and pool is still holding outdoors in the Quad in the center of Emory's campus.
Here's some color from the scene:
By the time Harris and Biden were about to speak hundreds of students stood around the perimeter, hoping to get a peek. Your pooler spotted Sen. Jon Ossoff, whose appearance attracted a number of high-pitched screams from students, and also Rep. Lucy McBath. Atlanta's Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms was spotted leaving before the remarks began. She walked outside with the administration's Cedric Richmond.
As members of the POTUS pool walked out of the building, a cheer broke out â€“ only for the students to discover the reporters were not Biden or Harris. A "give us Biden" chant then started.
When Stacey Abrams walked through the Quad to her meeting at 6:30 p.m., the crowd also screamed.
Ossoff and Warnock walked out together and walked to one side of the Quad, where they got into position to take about a dozen selfies at once. They then walked to another side and addressed the students.
Warnock: "We just wanted to say thank you to the people of Georgia for placing your trust in Jon and myself."
"Every day of the week Georgia is on our mind."
"Know that as you see checks being placed in people's accounts and shots in their arms and an expanded child tax credit, expanded earned income tax credit. $2 billion for Georgia to finally expand Medicaid. Healthcare - $5 billion for farmers of color. Know that as this agenda goes forward, it's because of Georgia."
"One last thing, you stood up in a historic way in November and in January and you see how some politicians are responding. They don't like the outcome of the election so they're trying to change the rules. We're going to do everything in our power that they don't disenfranchise millions of voters all across this country. But for every young person who's ever wondered whether or not your vote counts, you should have no doubt in your mind now. If your vote didn't matter they wouldn't be working so hard to try and stop it."
Ossoff: "All of your activism, all of your energy, all the doors you knocked on, all the phone calls that you made, everything that you did to secure victory has made a huge difference in millions of lives across this country. Thank you so much and much love."
They didn't answer reporters' questions about their discussions with Harris and Biden.

VPOTUS Pool Report No. 9 - departure
The joint motorcade pulled out of Emory's campus at 7:33 p.m. The VP's office said she's riding with President Biden in his limo back to the Peachtree DeKalb airport.
Pooler spotted one homemade Biden sign and a smattering of folks with their phones up on the motorcade route. A group of 100 or so people was gathered near the airport, several with official Biden-Harris campaign signs.
Motorcade pulled into the airport at 7:51 p.m.
Pool saw the SUV pull up to Marine Two at 7:54 but did not glimpse VPOTUS. We're taking off in the Opreys momentarily.

She's walking across the tarmac to Air Force Two and got on board at 8:13 p.m.
