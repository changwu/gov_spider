    THE opening of precinct registration in the District of Columbia tomorrow marks a day of significance for the people of the District. It is meaningful in that registration will be easier for District residents. But perhaps even more important is the symbol of restoration of political activity at the operating level--in the neighborhoods of this great Capital City. I hope it will prove to be a forerunner of self-government in the District.
I encourage everyone qualified to register to do so--regardless of party affiliation.
Last month, when I accepted the report of the Commission on Registration and Voting Participation, I expressed concern that, in the past, one out of every three Americans of voting age did not vote in presidential elections. Part of the explanation lies in the restrictive registration practices existing in some States. But the District law is not restrictive. Precinct registration will be at convenient locations and extend after working hours.
Although it should not be necessary to say so, no federal or District employee should fail to register--and vote--in the mistaken notion that to do so might be violating some law or regulation, or might subject him to political reprisals. Voting--and the customary preliminary of registration--are now open to District residents in presidential elections on the same basis as in every State, where federal employees participate freely in "the fundamental act of self-government."
