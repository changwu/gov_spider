    During Senator Clinton's recent campaign stop at a high school in Salem, New Hampshire to announce her "Agenda for Working Families," Clinton received an unexpected endorsement from former ABC News Anchorwoman Carole Simpson.
During the question and answer portion of the event, Simpson stood up and stated that she had something to say to the Senator and what better time than to do it now. "I want to tell you tonight, because I happen to be here with my students, that I endorse you for president of the United States. It's very freeing now that I'm not a journalist and I can speak my mind. I think you are the woman, and I think this is the time," she eloquently stated. She added that she had a dream that there would be a woman president in her lifetime.
"I am very honored to have Carole Simpson's endorsement and it was a wonderful surprise to hear during the event," said Clinton. "I look forward to Carole's continued support throughout the campaign season."
In January 2007, Simpson joined the faculty at Emerson College in Boston. Prior to joining Emerson College, Simpson had a prominent journalism career. Simpson anchored ABC World News Tonight Sunday from 1988-2003, joined ABC News from NBC News in 1982. Prior to joining NBC News in 1974, she was an instructor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.
Simpson helped anchor ABC's coverage of events, including the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa, the Tiananmen Square massacre and events surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing. Her reports have appeared on World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, Good Morning America, 20/20, Nightline and numerous ABC Special Events programs. Simpson moderated the 1992 presidential debate; she was the first woman and first African American to do so.
