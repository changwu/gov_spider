    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday issued the following statement after Donald Trump called for the United States to bar all Muslims from entering the country:
"Demagogues throughout our history have attempted to divide us based on race, gender, sexual orientation or country of origin. Now, Trump and others want us to hate all Muslims. The United States is a great nation when we stand together. We are a weak nation when we allow racism and xenophobia to divide us."
