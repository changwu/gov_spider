    The President intends to nominate George Munoz to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Management and Chief Financial Officer, the White House announced today. The President also expressed his approval of Secretary Bentsen's choices for three positions. Joyce Carrier, Joan Logue-Kinder, and Marina Weiss will serve as Deputy Assistant Secretaries with responsibility for Public Liaison, Public Affairs, and Health, respectively.
"George Munoz has excelled in a variety of ways in both the private and public sectors," said the President. "I am confident that he and the rest of Lloyd Bentsen's team at Treasury will keep that key Department running smoothly."
