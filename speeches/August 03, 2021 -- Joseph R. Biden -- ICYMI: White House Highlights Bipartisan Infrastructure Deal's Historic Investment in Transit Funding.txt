    Today, CNN reported on the White House's efforts to highlight the historic public transit funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, writing that the funding: "for repairs, upgrades, modernizations and expansions into high quality transit options into new communities has no precedent in recent history."
CNN writes that: "The spending in the agreement represents the biggest investment in public transit in US history, the [White House] official said, and comes at an urgent moment as aging and unreliable equipment -- facing more than $100 billion in repair backlogs, by some estimates -- has undercut transit agencies across the country."
The story emphasizes both the critical role transit plays in communities across the country and the special focus it received from the President during negotiations, reporting that "White House officials [view it] as a central pillar of Biden's push on issues like equity, climate and economic justiceâ€¦ serving as a key win for Democrats on an issue that had been one of the most difficult needles to thread in the talks, according to a Democrat familiar with the negotiations. It is designed to serve as a key mechanism to fund the administration's priorities outside the deal itself in the years ahead."
