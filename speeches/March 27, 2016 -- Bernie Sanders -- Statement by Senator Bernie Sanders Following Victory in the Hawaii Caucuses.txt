    
BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday issued the following statement after The Associated Press declared him the winner of Hawaii's Democratic caucuses:
"I want to thank the people of Hawaii for their strong support and for turning out in huge numbers for Saturday's caucuses. Nobody should have any doubt that this campaign has extraordinary momentum and that we have a path toward victory. In state after state, our grassroots effort has taken on the entire political establishment. We have taken on the senators and the governors and the mayors and the members of Congress. Our political revolution is the best chance we have to keep Donald Trump or any other Republican out of the White House."
