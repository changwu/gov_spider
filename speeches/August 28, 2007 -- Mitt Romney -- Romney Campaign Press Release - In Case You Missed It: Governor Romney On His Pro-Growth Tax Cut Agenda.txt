Governor Romney On His Agenda To Lower Taxes:
Bloomberg's Peter Cook: "Let me ask you about a couple of related issues - tax policy. You and several of your Republican candidate colleagues running for president right now have said you would make the Bush tax cuts permanent, you would simplify the tax code. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of distinction between all the candidates. Some have suggested perhaps this Fair Tax proposal might be worth considering. What exactly are the differences between you and some of your Republican colleagues, and how would you go further with regard to the tax rates?"
Governor Romney: "Well, first of all, I think I was the first to come out and talk about this topic, and back in February and March I laid out a plan that said: kill the death tax once and for all; keep the tax cuts and make them permanent; three, a savings plan. My view is people ought to be able to save their money, people of modest and moderate income should be able to save their money, and middle incomes as well, with zero tax - interest, dividends and capital gains. I also want to stop the spread of the Alternative Minimum Tax."
...
"I also think we need to lower the corporate tax rate. We're out of line with other nations. We have the second highest, or highest, depending on who's counting, tax rate among the OECD nations. That's a problem that without question slows growth."
...
"And then I would also think that we need to bring the marginal rates across the board. So, those are positions that I've taken."
