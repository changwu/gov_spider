    I applaud the Senate for acting quickly and in a strong, bipartisan manner to confirm the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. With today's historic vote, the Senate has demonstrated our shared commitment to doing everything we can to secure our homeland. Secretary Ridge is an outstanding and dedicated public servant who understands my administration's top priority always will be the protection of the American people, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him to fulfill this important responsibility.
