    GENTLEMEN, if I may take just a moment of your time, I would like to introduce you to these visitors. I stepped out of the room because they were meeting in the Roosevelt Room with Dr. Kissinger.
Over the past 4 years, approximately every month we have met with the leaders of the organization of the American league of families which represents our POW's and our MIA's in all of Indochina. They have been long meetings, and we have not in times past been able to do much but to tell them we have tried hard and that we hope for the best and we are praying for the best.
Today we were able to meet in an entirely different atmosphere than had ever been the case previously.
I would like to tell you where they are from, because it should be of interest to you.
Mrs. Sadler is from the State of Texas, and her husband is a MIA.
Mrs. Knapp is from Colorado, and her husband is a MIA.
Mrs. Galanti is now the president of the group, and her husband is a POW.
PHYLLIS GALANTI. I am from Virginia.
THE PRESIDENT. And you are from Virginia.
I want you to know that when I made my brief talk to the Nation the other day, I pointed out that there were--and I understand the attitudes of those who felt this way--that we were perhaps too insistent on peace with honor. But I can say there was no group in America who had a greater stake in ending the war as quickly as possible, without regard to how it was ended.
But the reason that I said these are some of the bravest people America has ever produced is that they never wavered. They always said, "We want our men back, but we also want peace with honor for what they fought for." That is what they are. We thank you.
