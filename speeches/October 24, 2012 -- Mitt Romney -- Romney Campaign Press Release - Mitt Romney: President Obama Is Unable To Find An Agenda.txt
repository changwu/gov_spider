MITT ROMNEY: "Now, I'm not sure whether you've been watching TV, but we've had a number of debates lately. Have you noticed that? Yeah, and you know, they have really propelled our campaign. We're seeing that across the country. People are coming together. At the same time, I think in some respects they've diminished the President's campaign because he's now been reduced to talking about, you know, Sesame Street characters and word games and misplaced attacks on me. And he knows they're false, of course. So, you know, with four debates behind us, including the vice presidential debate, the President's been unable to find an agenda and to communicate an agenda and to defend an agenda. And that's one reason why I think we all know that he's out of ideas and out of excuses. And in November, you're going to put him out of office. Now, this is a defining election. A lot of elections are important, but this, I believe, is a defining election. I say that because I think the choice that you make here in Nevada, and perhaps right here in Reno, will make a difference for the nation, will make a difference for the families of the nation and will make a difference for your family individually and specifically."
