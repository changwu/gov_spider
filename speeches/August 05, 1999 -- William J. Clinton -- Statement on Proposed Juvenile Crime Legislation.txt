    Months after the tragedy at Columbine and the day before they are set to recess, Congress will finally begin the conference on juvenile crime legislation. Let's show our children that, when it comes to their safety, Washington will not take a break. I urge the conferees to stay in Washington and finish work on the bill during the August recess. This is a vital opportunity to take commonsense steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands, prevent youth violence, and steer young people away from crime. They should send me a balanced and bipartisan juvenile crime bill, with the Senate-passed gun provisions, so we can give our Nation's parents more peace of mind as our children return to school.
