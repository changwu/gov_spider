    Q. This is for the President.
The President. No, no. I just finished an arduous press conference. And I can't talk anymore about anything because I just finished what I would say was a full and comprehensive press conference. And the President might be glad to take a question, but we've got to get on -- --
Q. Do you have a message for the Hungarian nation, Mr. President?
The President. Wait a minute, this may be one I want to break the rule for. [Laughter] Look, in the first place, it's a pleasure to have President Goncz back here. I hope he feels he's among friends because he is. And secondly, we have great respect for what Hungary is doing and trying to do in the future. And it is a dramatic story. It is a wonderfully exciting story about democracy and free markets. And yes, there are some economic problems, but we want to be as helpful as we can. We want this new democratic country and regime to be as successful as possible.
Glad you asked. Thanks. Thank you for your understanding.
