    Hillary for America announced today a growing list of African American women leaders have endorsed and will mobilize their networks to support Hillary Clinton. Over the next month, these women leaders will blanket South Carolina and March primary states as campaign surrogates and host women-to-women phone banks, organizing meetings, debate watch parties, and community meetings.
Today's announcement kicks off February's Weekend of Action, which will focus on celebrating African American History month with Clinton's volunteers across the country attending African American history events in their communities, hosting phone banks and going door to door to local businesses such as barbershops, beauty salons, corner grocery stores, neighborhood restaurants and other establishments to sign up new supporters. Surrogates and key leaders will talk about how Clinton will fight for women by working to close the pay gap, fight for paid family leave, make affordable childcare a reality, protect women's reproductive rights, raise the minimum wage, and promote women's rights around the world. Chelsea Clinton will hold events in South Carolina around the weekend of action.
"Hillary Clinton has been fighting for African American women and girls her entire career – and she's not going to stop now," said Director of African American Outreach LaDavia Drane. "Hillary knows the reality of women earning less than men, confronting barriers to advancing in the workforce, and politicians interfering with a woman's right to make her own health care decisions is even starker for African American women. As president, she'll implement the right policies to lift us up and move us forward. Hillary is a friend to the African American community and we're excited that these respected women leaders will campaign for her in the weeks to come."
