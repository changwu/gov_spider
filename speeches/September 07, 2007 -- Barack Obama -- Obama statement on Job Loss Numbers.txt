    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama released the following statement today in response to the employment climate and unemployment rate numbers released by the Labor Department.
"The Administration's failure to lead while thousands of Americans found themselves in danger of losing their homes is now affecting the broader economy, as thousands of workers lost their jobs this month for the first time in four years. To build an economy that spreads opportunity to every corner of this country, we need to invest in our workers, our infrastructure, and help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure by cracking down on unscrupulous lenders with new penalties and disclosure requirements."
