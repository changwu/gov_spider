    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sharp (R) Indiana)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 711 because the bill would authorize appropriations at levels inconsistent with the President's FY 1991 Budget. H.R. 711 would authorize appropriations in excess of $445 million for FYs 1991 through 1993 for three energy conservation programs. The President's FY 1991 Budget proposes the termination of two of these programs (the State Energy Conservation Program and the Institutional Conservation Program), and requests $30 million for the third (the Weatherization Assistance Program). The President's budget reflects the fact that States have more than $3 billion in unexpended oil overcharge funds from which these programs can be funded if States chose to support them.
The Administration also opposes provisions limiting the Secretary of Energy's ability to select members of a State Energy Advisory Board. Such limitations offend the general principle of the separation of powers. To preserve the unity and integrity of the Executive Branch, the Secretary must have the power to appoint, even to an advisory commission, those individuals he deems best suited to give him advice.
