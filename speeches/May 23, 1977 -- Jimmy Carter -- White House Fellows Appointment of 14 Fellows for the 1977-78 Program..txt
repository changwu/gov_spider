The White House Fellowship program was established in 1964 to provide outstanding young Americans with firsthand experience in the process of governing the Nation. It is open to U.S. citizens from all occupations and professions. (Employees of the Federal Government are not eligible, with the exception of career Armed Forces personnel.)
In addition to their educational assignments with the Vice President, members of the Cabinet, and members of the White House staff, the Fellows participate in an extensive seminar program that typically includes some 300 off-record sessions with top Government officials, scholars, journalists, and leaders from various other segments of private life.
Leadership, intellectual and professional ability, and a commitment to community and Nation are the broad criteria employed in the selection process.
Applications for the 1978-79 program will be available in August 1977. Application forms and additional information on the program can be obtained by sending a postcard to the President's Commission on White House Fellowships, Washington, D.C. 20415, or by calling (202) 653-6263.
