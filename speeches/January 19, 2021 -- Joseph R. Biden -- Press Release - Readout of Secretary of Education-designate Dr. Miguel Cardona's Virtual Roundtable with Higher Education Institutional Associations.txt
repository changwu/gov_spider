    Yesterday, Secretary of Education-designate Dr. Miguel Cardona met virtually with representatives of leading higher education trade associations from a range of sectors to discuss issues including pandemic recovery, access and equity, and how best to increase student success.
The higher education leaders raised the unique needs faced by Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving Institutions, Minority-serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities. They discussed the need to expand pathways, training programs, and resources to students â€” particularly low-income, first generation, and historically underrepresented students. They expressed the need for additional COVID-19 relief, and a focus on meeting students' basic needs. Other issues, including rural colleges' need for additional broadband, were raised.
Secretary-designate Cardona thanked the higher education leaders for their partnership and said, if confirmed, that he looked forward to their regular and ongoing collaboration. The Secretary-designate was joined by:
