    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 3(f) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1862(f)), I am pleased to send you the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1992. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and computer sciences; engineering; and education in those fields.
Achievements such as the ones described in this report are the basis for much of our Nation's strengthâ€”its economic growth, national security, and the overall well-being of our people.
As we move toward the 21st century, the Foundation will continue its efforts to expand our Nation's research achievements, our productivity, and our ability to remain competitive in world markets.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
