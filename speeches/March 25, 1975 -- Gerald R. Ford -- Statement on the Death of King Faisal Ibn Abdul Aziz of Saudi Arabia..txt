    IT WAS with the deepest sorrow that I learned of the tragic death of His Majesty King Faisal, a close friend of the United States and a leader who achieved so much for his people and those of the Arab world and Islam and whose wisdom and stature earned the respect of the entire world. On behalf of the American people, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the Royal Family and to the people of Saudi Arabia, whose grief we share.
