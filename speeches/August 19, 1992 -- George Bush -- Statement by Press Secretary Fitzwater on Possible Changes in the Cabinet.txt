    President Bush yesterday commented in a PBS interview that there would undoubtedly be changes in the Cabinet in the second term. He said this would be a normal situation historically, and he did not refer to any specific individual. The President believes his Cabinet is doing an excellent job.
The President called Jack Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, this morning to congratulate him on his speech to the convention and to express his concern about Jack being singled out by the Houston Post this morning as departing from the Cabinet. The President√ø20assured Jack that he was referring only to the routine departure of Cabinet members that historically occurs in a second term.
