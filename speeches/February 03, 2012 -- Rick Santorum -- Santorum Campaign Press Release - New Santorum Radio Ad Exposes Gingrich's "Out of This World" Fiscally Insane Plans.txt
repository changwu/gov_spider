    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign today released a new nationwide radio advertisement today entitled "Out of This World." It exposes Representative Gingrich's fiscally insane plan to colonize the moon as just another example of Gingrich's erratic behavior and wild ideas that pander to a crowd, cost taxpayers money and exponentially grow the size of government. This presents a clear contrast with Rick Santorum's fiscally conservative vision to balance the budget, reform entitlements, and revitalize American manufacturing.

Script To "Out Of This World:


Voice Over:
Reckless spending has led to a 15 trillion dollar national debt.
That's 50,000 dollars of debt for every person in America... and it's crushing our economic recovery.
And what's does Newt Gingrich suggest? Spending half a trillion dollars on a moon colony.

Newt Gingrich:
By the end of my second term we will have the first permanent base on the moon.
When we have 13,000 living on the moon, they can petition to become a state.
Voice Over:
Gingrich's idea is fiscal insanity.
And another reason true conservatives are uniting behind Rick Santorum.
Unlike Gingrich, Santorum opposed all the bailouts. And Rick Santorum successfully reformed welfare, and has fought tirelessly for a balanced budget amendment.
Rick Santorum...he doesn't just talk a good conservative game...he lives it.

Paid for by Rick Santorum for President.

Rick Santorum:
I'm Rick Santorum, candidate for President, and I approve this message.
