    I HAVE JUST been informed that Belgium, by the vote of its Senate today, has completed all parliamentary action leading to ratification of the treaty establishing the European Defense Community. Belgium has thus become the third nation whose legislature has taken this important step.
One of the most important conditions essential to assuring lasting peace will be met when an integrated and, therefore, stronger European Community has been built. I am gratified that steady progress is being made toward this goal.
