    On behalf of the United States, I extend my condolences to the people of Serbia and to the family of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who was shot and killed this morning.
History will remember Prime Minister Djindjic for his strong leadership during Serbia's successful struggle to end the dictatorship of Slobodan Milosevic. Following the peaceful transition to a new, democratic Government, Djindjic acted with strength and courage to transfer Milosevic to The Hague, where today he stands on trial for war crimes. At the helm of the new Government, Prime Minister Djindjic was committed to building a prosperous, democratic future for Serbia, and he fought to hasten that future's arrival by fighting organized crime and reforming Serbia's economy and political institutions.
The United States will continue to support Serbia's pursuit of reforms that will open the way to a brighter future and full integration with Europe.
