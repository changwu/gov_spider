Throughout the summer, President Obama has met with families to listen to their concerns and to discuss specific ways to jumpstart job creation and strengthen the middle class. He met with residents of Fairfax, Virginia, earlier this month and families in Columbus, Ohio, in August. After Albuquerque, the President will travel to Des Moines, Iowa, and Richmond, Virginia, for more conversations with middle-class families.
