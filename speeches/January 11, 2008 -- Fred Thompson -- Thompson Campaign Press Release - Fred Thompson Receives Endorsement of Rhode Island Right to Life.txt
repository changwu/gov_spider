McLean, VA - Today the Rhode Island Right to Life Federal PAC endorsed Senator Fred Thompson for President.
"The RI Right to Life Federal PAC will do all it can to assist in the nomination of Fred Thompson for President," said Rita Parquette, Executive Director of Rhode Island Right to Life. "Fred Thompson will do everything he can to protect the lives of the unborn, the elderly, the disabled and the sick if he becomes the next president of the United States."
Rhode Island Right to Life's mission is to advocate for a state, nation and world in which the innocent lives of the unborn, the disabled, the elderly, and the ill are cherished by the citizenry and protected by civil law.
"I'm blessed and honored to have the endorsement of the Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee for President of the United States," said Senator Thompson. "These folks in Rhode Island have voted to endorse my candidacy because they know I have stood with them yesterday, I stand with them today, and will stand with them tomorrow. They know I have the ability to win this election. They know I believe in the sanctity of life and as President I will do all that I can to do to protect life."
