    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards for President Campaign Manager, David Bonior, today released the following statement in response to Senator Clinton's mailer to Iowa voters defending her Iran vote:
"This morning we see that Senator Clinton is defending her vote to declare the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. She was entitled to her vote just like she's entitled to defend it. The problem is her explanation to Iowa voters is different than her explanation to the New York Times. Her backers told the New York Times that her vote was about shifting from primary election mode to general election mode. Now she's telling Iowans something different. Apparently she has an Iowa mode and a Washington mode too.
"We have already seen the devastating consequences of triangulation and manipulation in Iraq. Particularly on the critical challenge on Iran, where the administration appears to be readying the guns of war, Democrats deserve a nominee who only has one mode - and that's 'telling the truth' mode."
