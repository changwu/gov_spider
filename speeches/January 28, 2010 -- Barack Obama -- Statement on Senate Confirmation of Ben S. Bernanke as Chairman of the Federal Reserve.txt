    I am gratified by the Senate's broad bipartisan vote to confirm Ben Bernanke for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. As the Nation continues to face the consequences of the worst recession in a generation, Ben Bernanke has provided wisdom and steady leadership in the midst of the financial and economic crisis. While the worst of the storm has passed, its devastation remains, and we have a lot of work to do to rebuild our economy.
I congratulate him on his confirmation and look forward to working with him in the days ahead.
