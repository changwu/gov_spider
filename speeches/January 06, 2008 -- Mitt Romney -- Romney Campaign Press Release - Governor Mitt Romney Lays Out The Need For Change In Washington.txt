Manchester, NH â€“ Tonight, Romney for President Communications Director Matt Rhoades released the following statement on the twelfth Republican presidential debate:
"Governor Romney clearly won tonight's debate. The people of New Hampshire saw in Governor Romney a leader who can bring true conservative change to Washington. He has executive leadership experience in turning around troubled institutions. That is experience that cannot be gained in the Senate Cloakroom. With his experience, Governor Romney is the best candidate to change Washington and solve the big challenges confronting our nation. We cannot do that with Washington insiders who have talked for years, but taken little action."
