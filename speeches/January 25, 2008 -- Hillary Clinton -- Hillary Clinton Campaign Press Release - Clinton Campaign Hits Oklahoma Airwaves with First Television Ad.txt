    With the economy sliding into recession, the Clinton campaign today announced that it is going up on the air with its first television ad in Oklahoma highlighting Senator Clinton's plan to revive our economy by moving away from the policies of the Bush administration and rebuilding our middle class.
In the 30-second spot, entitled "Falling Through," Hillary vows to be a president that takes on the oil, predatory lending and drug companies and stands up for America's families.

"Falling Through"
TV :30
Hillary Clinton:
"The Bush economy is like a trapdoor.
"Too many families are one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment, one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything.
"The oil companies, the predatory student loan companies, the insurance companies and the drug companies, have had seven years of a president who stands up for them.
"I intend to be a president who stands up for all of you."
"I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message."
