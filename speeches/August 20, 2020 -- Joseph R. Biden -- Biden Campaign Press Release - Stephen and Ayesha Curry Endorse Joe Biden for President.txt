Stephen and Ayesha highlight the importance of November's election for the future of our nation's children. "We want to ensure that our kids live in a nation that is safe, happy, healthy, and fair," said New York Times best-selling author and entrepreneur Ayesha Curry. "This upcoming election is especially important. One, because of the social injustices right now, racial inequality, but also because we have children."
"We're voting for Joe Biden," added three-time NBA Champion and two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry.
In talking to their daughters, Stephen asked "What would you say if you knew that Joe Biden was going to have a woman as his Vice President?" Riley said she was "surprised and happy."
