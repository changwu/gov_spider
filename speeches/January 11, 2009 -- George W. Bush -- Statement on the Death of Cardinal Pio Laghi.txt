    Laura and I send our deepest condolences to Pope Benedict XVI and all Catholics on the passing of Cardinal Pio Laghi. Cardinal Laghi was a friend who, in his more than 60 years of service to the Catholic Church, worked tirelessly for peace and justice in our world. As the Papal Nuncio to the United States during the final years of the cold war, and in his many other assignments, Cardinal Laghi always strove to unite people of all religions and promote reconciliation, religious freedom, and tolerance. Cardinal Laghi holds an especially important place in the hearts of the American people, having served as the first Papal Nuncio to the United States following the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Holy See in 1984.
On behalf of all Americans, Laura and I join Catholics around the world to offer our gratitude for the courageous service and life of Cardinal Laghi and commit ourselves to carrying his peaceful message forward.
