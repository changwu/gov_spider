Add President Obama's $800 billion stimulus to the constantly growing list of public policy issues that Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on.
In the 2010 hardcover edition of No Apology, Mr. Romney wrote, "The 'all-Democrat' stimulus that was passed in early 2009 will accelerate the timing of the start of the recovery." When No Apology was published in paperback 2011, Mr. Romney flip-flopped and wrote, "The 'all-Democrat' stimulus that was passed in early 2009 has been a failure."


"Governor Romney and President Obama were both wrong about the stimulus — it didn't work to create jobs," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. "Governor Romney is Obama-lite — supporting the stimulus, government-mandated health care, and federal intervention into schools — but when his liberal positions are discovered, he flips with ease."
In last week's debate, Mr. Romney said, "Please don't try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book. I stand by what I wrote."
After the debate, he told Sean Hannity, "When you write a book, you have to be careful with what you write down. It's like, be very careful, because if you're running for President those things will come back and haunt you."
Today, that haunting is Mr. Romney's belief that the Obama stimulus would spark an economic recovery.
