    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lewis (R) Florida and 23 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1438, which would rename the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida as the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, because the general policy is to name refuges after their most significant geographical feature or location, in this case the Loxahatchee Slough. Refuges are occasionally named for individuals, but only if the person involved donated the refuge property or was a figure of national significance.
Arthur R. Marshall is not well known outside of Florida. Moreover, renaming the refuge would be confusing to the public and would require costly changes to maps, signs, and other material.
In recognition of Mr. Marshall's efforts to preserve the Everglades, however, the Administration is willing to name a refuge feature after him, which could be done under existing authority.
