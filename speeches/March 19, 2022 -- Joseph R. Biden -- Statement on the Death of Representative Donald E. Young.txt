    I knew Don Young for a long time. He always stayed true to who he was and the people of Alaska he represented. Tough. Loyal. A consensus builder.
He was larger than life, but always focused on Alaskans' everyday lives. As Dean of the House, he was the longest-serving House Republican in historyâ€”but cherished photos of his legislation being signed into law by ten Presidents, Republicans and Democrats.
There is no doubt that few legislators have left a greater mark on their State. Don's legacy lives on in the infrastructure projects he delighted in steering across Alaska. In the opportunities he advanced for his constituents. In the enhanced protections for Native Tribes he championed. His legacy will continue in the America he loved.
Jill and I send our prayers to his wife Anne, to his daughters and the entire Young family, and to the people of Alaska.
May God bless Don Young.
