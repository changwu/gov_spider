    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the vote on the Blunt amendment:
"I applaud the Senators who took a stand today and voted to defend religious freedom. The Obama Administration has directly attacked the First Amendment of our Constitution and individual liberty. The President of the United States must protect and defend the Constitution, not ignore it. This is yet another example of what is wrong with Obamacare, and why I am committed to its repeal."
