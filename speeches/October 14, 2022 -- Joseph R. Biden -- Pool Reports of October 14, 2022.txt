Out-of-Town Pool Report #12: POTUS at Oregon Democrats event
POTUS walked into the room at 7:11 holding a box of donuts from Sesame Donuts. He was joined by Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici and Tina Kotek, the Democratic nominee for governor.
POTUS began by saying this year's midterm elections are the most important off-year elections since Roosevelt.
"I'm here because Ron Wyden has been such an incredible chairman," he said, going on to praise Wyden's work on tax reform in the Senate.
He also thanked Oregon Democrats for their help in his election, saying it was nice "to win by 16 points."
POTUS then talked about Democrats' legislative record, specifically efforts to raise taxes on corporations and lower the costs of prescription drugs.
As POTUS thanked the Oregon delegation, he walked over to Rep. Bonamici and put his hand around her.
"By the way it's her birthday today… she just turned 30," he said.
He then walked over and grabbed Kotek's hand and the two walked to the center of the room as volunteers cheered
"What a governor does matters," he said.
POTUS wrapped up his remarks with his usual refrain about his optimism about the future of the United States.
POTUS concluded his remarks at 7:21 and joined a table of volunteers to call voters.
Before he started making calls, he grabbed a
donut from the box he brought and ripped off a piece of one chocolate-covered Long John donut and ate it.
POTUS appeared to connect with some voters on the phone, but the pool was stationed at the back of the room and could not hear any of the conversations. At one point, POTUS moved to another volunteer and put on her headset to talk to voter.
POTUS spent an extended amount of time on one phone call, pacing around the room as he held up an iPhone to his ear.
POTUS then took a second donut. This time the whole one and it was glazed.
Pool was ushered out of the union hall at 7:41 as POTUS was still sitting with volunteers and finishing his donut.
