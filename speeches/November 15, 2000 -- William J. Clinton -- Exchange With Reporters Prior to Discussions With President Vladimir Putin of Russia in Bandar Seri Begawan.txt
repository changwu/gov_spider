[At this point, a question was asked in Russian, and a translation was not provided.]
President Putin. President Clinton, during the term of his Presidency, has caused a breakthrough in the U.S.-Russian relations. And we expect this torch to be given to whoever will be the successor.
2000 Presidential Election
Q. Mr. President, how are you going to explain what's going on back home to Mr. Putin and other foreign leaders?
President Clinton. Well, I think it's pretty clear that no one knows yet who won the election. There are recounts in progress, and there will be a full accounting according to an accepted legal process in America. We have plenty of time. There's nothing to worry about.
I think other leaders should have the same reaction the American people have about it. I think they are pretty relaxed about it now. They're going to let the process play out. Both sides are certainly very well represented, and they'll argue their points, and we'll see how it works.
