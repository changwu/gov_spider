    Today, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien led the United States delegation commemorating the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) convention. He delivered remarks, participated in panels on topics such as COVID-19 recovery, and held bilateral meetings with member states. Throughout these engagements, he reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to the organization as well as to the principles of free markets, fair and reciprocal trade, investment and innovation, fighting corruption, and promoting the rule of law. O'Brien also pressed the case that Chris Liddell is the right person at the right time to be the next Secretary General of the OECD.
