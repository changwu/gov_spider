    Too many Americans have been left out of the economic recovery — and in recent decades, our economy has benefited the wealthy and left the middle class behind. When sixty of the Fortune 500 corporations paid $0 in federal income tax last year, and 40% of Americans don't have $400 to spare in case of an emergency, it's clear our economy isn't working for everyone.
Dark money groups and corporate PACs have tilted the scales in Washington to favor Big Money donors at the expense of working families. Taking on the corrupting influence of money in politics has been the fight of Governor Bullock's career, and as President, he'll start on Day One with an ambitious plan to combat dark money in our elections and make sure Washington — and the economy — works for everyone.

Under Governor Bullock's leadership, Montana led the nation in middle class growth.
