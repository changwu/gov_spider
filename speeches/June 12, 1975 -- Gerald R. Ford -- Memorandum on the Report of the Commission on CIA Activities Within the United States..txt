Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Director of Central Intelligence Subject: Report of the Commission on Central Intelligence Activities Within the United States
On January 4, 1975, I established a Commission on Central Intelligence Activities Within the United States to determine whether any domestic activities of the CIA exceeded the Agency's statutory authority. The Commission has completed its work and has submitted a report which contains a number of recommendations for changes in the framework within which U.S. intelligence activities are conducted. I have reviewed the report and believe that it establishes a sound basis for addressing structural and other possible weaknesses in the Operation of the CIA and other intelligence bodies.
It is vital to the national security and foreign policy of the United States that we preserve and strengthen our intelligence institutions and capabilities. It is equally important that all government intelligence activities strictly observe constitutional guarantees against the violation of individual civil liberties. Within this context, I request that you review the report and provide me your comments on the report and its recommendations as soon as possible.
