    President Bush has invited the leaders of Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, and Yemen to meet with G-8 leaders on June 9, 2004, in Sea Island, Georgia.
He looks forward to a discussion of how the G-8 can support political, economic, and social freedom in the greater Middle East. The President hopes that these leaders will discuss their efforts to pursue democracy and reform in their countries.
The President anticipates that the G-8 will respond to calls for reform from the region with offers of concrete support that will help reformers implement their plans.
