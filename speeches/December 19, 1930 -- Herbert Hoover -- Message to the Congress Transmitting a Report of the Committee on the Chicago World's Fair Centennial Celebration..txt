    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report of the committee which I was authorized to appoint (Public Res. No. 92, 71st Cong., 2d sess.) for an investigation into the question of representation at and participation in the Chicago World's Fair Centennial Celebration, known as the Century of Progress Exposition, on the part of the Government of the United States and its various departments and activities.
The findings of this committee include recommendations that the Government be represented in the person of a commissioner under the direction of a commission composed of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Commerce; that in order to effect economies the organization of this commission and the authorization and appropriation of funds be expedited; and that a certain latitude be conferred upon the commission and the commissioner in the expenditure of public funds, as well as in the employment of personnel.
I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the inclosed report of the committee to the end that legislation may be enacted to authorize an appropriation of $1,725,000 for the expenses of representation at and participation in the Chicago World's Fair Centennial Celebration, known as the Century of Progress Exposition, on the part of the Government of the United States and its various departments and activities in accordance with the recommendations of the committee.
