    The President today indicated his pleasure that Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige and Vice Presidents of the Commission of the European Communities Viscount Etienne Davignon and Wilhelm Haferkamp have reached agreement on an arrangement which he believes could lead to a resolution of our steel trade problems. These negotiations have been very difficult and complex, and only the determination of both parties to succeed, and a spirit of understanding and cooperation, made agreement possible.
