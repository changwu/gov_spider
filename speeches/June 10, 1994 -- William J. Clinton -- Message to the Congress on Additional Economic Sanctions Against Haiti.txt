    To the Congress of the United States:
On October 4, 1991, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA") (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and section 301 of the National Emergencies Act ("NEA") (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), President Bush exercised his statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12775 of October 4, 1991, declaring a national emergency and blocking Haitian government property.
On October 28, 1991, pursuant to the above authorities, President Bush exercised his statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12779 of October 28, 1991, blocking property of and prohibiting transactions with Haiti.
On June 30, 1993, pursuant to the above authorities, as well as the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended ("UNPA") (22 U.S.C. 287c), I exercised my statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12853 of June 30, 1993, to impose additional economic measures with respect to Haiti. This latter action was taken, in part, to ensure that the economic measures taken by the United States with respect to Haiti would fulfill its obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 841 of June 16, 1993.
On October 18, 1993, pursuant to the IEEPA and the NEA, I again exercised my statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12872 of October 18, 1993, blocking property of various persons with respect to Haiti.
On May 6, 1994, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 917, calling on Member States to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against Haiti. On May 7, 1994, pursuant to the above authorities, I exercised my statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12914 of May 7, 1994, to impose additional economic measures with respect to Haiti. On May 21, 1994, pursuant to the above authorities, I exercised my statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12917 of May 21, 1994, to impose economic measures required by Resolution 917. These latter actions were taken, in part, to ensure that the economic measures taken by the United States with respect to Haiti would fulfill its obligations under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 917.
On June 10, 1994, pursuant to the above authorities, I exercised my statutory authority to issue Executive Order No. 12920 of June 10, 1994, prohibiting additional transactions with Haiti.
This new Executive order:
—prohibits payment or transfer of funds or other assets to Haiti from or through the United States or to or through the United States from Haiti, with exceptions for activities of the United States Government, the United Nations, the Organization of American States, or foreign diplomatic missions, certain payments related to humanitarian assistance in Haiti, limited family remittances, funds for travel-related expenses, and payments incidental to exempt shipments of food, medicine, medical supplies, and informational materials;
—prohibits the sale, supply, or exportation by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of any goods, technology, or services to Haiti or in connection with Haitian businesses, or activities by United States persons or in the United States that promote such sale, supply, or exportation, except for the sale, supply, or exportation of informational materials, certain foodstuffs, and medicines and medical supplies;
—prohibits any transaction that evades or avoids or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions of this order; and
—authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to issue regulations implementing the provisions of the Executive order.
The new Executive order is necessary to tighten the embargo against Haiti with the goal of the restoration of democracy in that nation and the prompt return of the legitimately elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, under the framework of the Governors Island Agreement.
I am providing this notice to the Congress pursuant to section 204(b) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and section 301 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1631). I am enclosing a copy of the Executive order that I have issued.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, June 10, 1994.
