"The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic." @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo The great Scam continues. To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history, when I am so busy, is sad!Retweets: 29387Favorites: 138488

The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian President's strong statement, NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!Retweets: 25732Favorites: 127580

Congress & the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, & we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!Retweets: 29349Favorites: 154924

The homeless situation in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and many other Democrat Party run cities throughout the Nation is a state and local problem, not a federal problem....Retweets: 31225Favorites: 159707

....If however, the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility, and politely asks for help from the Federal Government, we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run Democrat Cities Great Again!Retweets: 18692Favorites: 98798
