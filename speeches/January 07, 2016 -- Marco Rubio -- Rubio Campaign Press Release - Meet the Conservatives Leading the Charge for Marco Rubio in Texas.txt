Texas State Representatives James Frank and Larry Gonzales, along with former legislators Linda Harper-Brown and Martha Wong, are leading up efforts for Marco in the Lone Star State.Rep. Frank outlines why Marco is the best choice:
Marco's conservative ideas will help decrease the size and scope of government so that more Texans can enjoy the freedoms needed to achieve the American Dream.
His own inspiring story is woven from the very fabric of America and the dream of what one can achieve in our great nation. Based on his record and his vision, I believe that Marco is a next-generation conservative who understands how to keep our nation safe, create an environment to grow jobs and increase wages, and ensure that all Americans have a shot at a better tomorrow.

Frank previously outlined to his supporters why he chose Marco over the other contenders.Rep. Gonzales, of Round Rock, is a small business owner.
Harper-Brown served as a State Representative until 2015 and is a former Irving City Councilman.
Wong, of Houston, was the first Asian-American woman elected to the Texas legislature.Welcome to Team Marco, and thanks for joining up with a team that's building momentum all across the country!
