    President Bush. Madam Chancellor, thank you for yet another visit. I value your friendship; I value your advice. We talked about a lot of common problems and a lot of common opportunities. We talked about the G-8. We talked about the need to work—to continue to work together on Iran. Angela Merkel is a constructive force for good. And I appreciate your time. Thank you.
Chancellor Merkel. Well, thank you very much. As always, we had a very interesting exchange of view, a very intensive exchange of view. And let me tell you that I'm very satisfied with the work that has gone on, on the G-8 documents, as regards progress on the issue of climate change, cooperation in the area of food and oil. We discussed here a number of other foreign policy— foreign political issues—sorry. We also discussed WTO and the possible conclusion to that negotiating process. And let me say that we are hopeful that such a successful conclusion may be possible over the next few weeks to come.
President Bush. Thank you.
