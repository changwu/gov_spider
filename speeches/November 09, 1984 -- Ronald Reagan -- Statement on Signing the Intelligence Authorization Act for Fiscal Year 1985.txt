    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5399, the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1985. This act represents another step in my continuing effort to revitalize our Nation's intelligence capability. Given the ever-increasing difficulty of ensuring the security of this nation, it is essential that we have an Intelligence Community capable of meeting these diverse challenges. In authorizing sufficient appropriations and in providing new administrative authorities that enhance the ability of our intelligence agencies to perform their missions, Congress has, with this act, provided the basis for maintaining and building our intelligence capabilities. This act ensures that the Intelligence Community can continue to stay firmly on the path of progress that we and the Congress have charted together.
I sincerely regret the inability of the Congress to resolve the issue of continuing certain activities in Nicaragua that are important to achieving U.S. policy objectives. The necessity of U.S. support for this program is beyond question. I am signing this act with every expectation that shortly after the next Congress convenes it will provide adequate support for programs to assist the development of democracy in Central America.
