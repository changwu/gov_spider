    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 206 (b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, I transmit herewith a report for the calendar year 1963, on this nation's aeronautics and space activities.
The year 1963 was a period of constructive development of our increasing space competence. It was also a period of searching evaluation of the national space program--an evaluation which resulted in broad acceptance of the policy of our attaining and maintaining space leadership, with due regard for our national security.
Our space program, in both its civilian and military aspects, is peaceful in purpose and practice. Moreover, it combines such objective with a policy of international cooperation based upon a mutuality of participation and benefits as well as the wide dissemination of knowledge.
Space progress is essential if this nation is to lead in technology and in the furthering of world peace. Such progress requires the use of substantial resources, which must be employed efficiently and effectively in order that we obtain the maximum benefits with a minimum of waste.
In summary form, the accompanying report depicts the contributions of the various departments and agencies of the Government to the national space program during 1963â€¢
