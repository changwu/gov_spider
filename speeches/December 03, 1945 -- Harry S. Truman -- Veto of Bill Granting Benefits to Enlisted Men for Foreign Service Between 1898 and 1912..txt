    To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith, without my approval, H.R. 1512 providing that retired enlisted men who have been, or may be, retired with credit for thirty years' service in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps and who served beyond the continental limits of the United States between 1898 and 1912, such service having been computed under previous laws as double time toward retirement, shall be entitled to receive the maximum retired pay now provided for the grade in which retired.
While enlisted men who performed certain foreign service between 1898 and 1912 may count such service double in computing length of service for retirement, they do not receive double credit for such service for longevity pay purposes. H.R. 1512 would, in effect, grant double credit in computing longevity pay for the foreign service which was counted double in determining their right to retirement.
Enlisted men who enlisted subsequent to August 24, 1912 may not count such foreign service as double for any purpose. Thus those who performed such service prior to 1912 and retired with less than thirty years of actual service have already received a substantial benefit. I am unable to see any reason for granting further benefits to those included within the particular group covered by this bill, who have already received more favorable treatment with respect to retirement benefits than other service personnel who could retire only after thirty years' actual service.
