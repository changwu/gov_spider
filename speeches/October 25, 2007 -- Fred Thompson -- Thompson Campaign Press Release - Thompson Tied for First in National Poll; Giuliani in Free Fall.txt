    While Fred Thompson travels the nation with his message of consistent conservatism and touts his border security and immigration reform proposal, a recent national tracking poll shows that Thompson has pulled into a virtual tie with Rudy Giuliani. This poll further shows that Rudy has lost almost a third of his support in the last 12 days. (Margin of error is +/- 4 percent)
