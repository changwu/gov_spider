    Washington, DC--Today, Second Lady Karen Pence welcomed members of the Indiana World Organization of China Painters to the Vice President's Residence to thank the artists for their contribution to our nation's history. Thirty-nine artists from Indiana painted 100 porcelain dessert plates and each one is decorated with a state flower. Each of the 50 states has two plates. The new plates will coordinate with the blue and gold Lenox china chosen by the Bidens.
"I am excited to add such beautiful work of art to the china collection at the Vice President's Residence," said Mrs. Karen Pence. "The Indiana World Organization of China Painters dedicated their heart and time into this project with great enthusiasm. I applaud their work and look forward to entertaining with these beautiful plates. From the bottom of my heart, I thank the Indiana artists for their remarkable contribution to the Vice President's Residence."
Last summer, artists submitted examples of their artwork to the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis where people who visited the Indiana China Painters exhibit voted on their favorite artwork. The winners of that competition are the ones who participated in this project.
