    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today the Cruz for President campaign launched a new TV ad, "Supreme Trust", highlighting the importance this election has on determining the future makeup of the Supreme Court. If conservatives elect a Republican with a past liberal record, or with no record of actually fighting judicial activism or defending the principles of the Constitution, we risk the further erosion of our constitutional liberties.

In the ad, it shows Donald Trump speaking with Tim Russert, defending his liberal position on abortion. Trump says that he would not ban partial birth abortions and that he is "very pro-choice."
