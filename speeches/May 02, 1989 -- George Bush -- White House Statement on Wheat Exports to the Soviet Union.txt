    The President today approved a proposed sale of 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union under the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). The wheat is intended for delivery in May and June.
The EEP was created in 1985 to enable U.S. exports of commodities to be sustained in the face of subsidies offered by foreign governments. It is intended to support our efforts to negotiate an international understanding on the removal of subsidies and other impediments to trade in agriculture. The President concluded that the dual objectives of maintaining market share for our farm exports and advancing international negotiations warrant the use of the EEP in this case.
