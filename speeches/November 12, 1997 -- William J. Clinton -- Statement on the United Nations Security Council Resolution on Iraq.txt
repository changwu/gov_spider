    I welcome the prompt, clear, and strong resolution by the United Nations Security Council condemning Iraq for obstructing the work of international weapons inspectors and defying the will of the international community. With one voice, the Security Council has made it clear that Iraq's actions are unacceptable; that it must submit to investigations into Baghdad's ballistic missile, biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons programs; and that sanctions will remain in place until Iraq cooperates. For Iraq, there is one simple way out of the box Saddam Hussein has put it in: Comply with the will of the international community.
