    Laura and I deeply mourn the death of American painter Andrew Wyeth.
Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine.
Mr. Wyeth was no stranger to White House recognitions. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. President Nixon sponsored an exhibition of Andrew Wyeth's paintings at the White House. In 1990, my father presented Mr. Wyeth the Congressional Gold Medal. And in 2007, I awarded Mr. Wyeth the National Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and contribution to American arts and culture.
Laura and I are fortunate to have known Andrew Wyeth and to have had the pleasure of enjoying his work. In 2005, Andrew and his wife Betsy presented to the White House his painting, "Jupiter," which is displayed in the Family Sitting Room in the Residence.
On behalf of the American people, Laura and I offer our sincere condolences to Betsy and the Wyeth family. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
