    Once again, Americans join with the nation of Israel in their grief. On their behalf, I extend to Prime Minister Peres and to all his people our heartfelt condolence. We share your anguish and anger at this terrorist crime.
Those responsible again have shown the world that they are determined to stop the cause of peace through the brutal murder of Israeli citizens. But there must be no misunderstanding: The Palestinian people and their leaders, as well as the promise of peace itself, will be the true victims if those responsible are not stopped.
It is imperative that everything possible be done to help ensure that these tragic scenes are not repeated. Peacemakers must be as resolute as are the destroyers of peace in taking action now to confront this terror. To Prime Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat, I pledge that the United States will stand with you and with all those—Israelis and Palestinians—who support peace as you take up this challenge.
