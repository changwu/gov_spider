The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at '1000 people' when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin'. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don't 'get' me and never did!Retweets: 19627Favorites: 83247

Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr. Gee he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?Retweets: 45555Favorites: 164092

With the #RightToTry Law I signed today patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions. These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise... https://t.co/FIUwhpUpoLRetweets: 18539Favorites: 78198
