    Today, The Hill published an op-ed by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in which he argues that President Biden's tax plan will level the playing field for families across the country by taxing the wealthy their fair share.
He writes: "One of the key questions at the heart of the negotiations is how to pay for them. The president has laid out a common-sense tax reform proposal that not only pays for these investments, it also corrects for the excesses of the Trump tax cuts and brings our tax code in line with American values â€” a tax system that rewards work, not just wealth and ensures that those at the top and corporations pay their fair share."
Reid refutes the GOP argument that getting the top 1% to pay their fair share in taxes will have detrimental effects on middle and working class Americans: "Here's where you can see Washington cynicism work its way in. There are those who say you can't get the very richest Americans to pay tax without hurting family farms. That's just wrong-headed. We can get millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share and fully protect real family farms. We shouldn't let the wealthiest Americans hide behind family farms that are fully protected in these reforms."
