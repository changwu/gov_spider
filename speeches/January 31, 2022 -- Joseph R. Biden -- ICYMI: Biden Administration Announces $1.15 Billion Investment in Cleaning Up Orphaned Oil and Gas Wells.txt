    Today, the Department of Interior announced that $1.15 billion in funding from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is?available for states to assist with cleaning up orphaned oil and gas wells that are hazardous to the health and safety of communities across the country. Plugging these wells will not only reduce methane emissions and stop dangerous pollution, but it will create good-paying, union jobs and spur economic revitalization, especially in hard-hit energy communities.
The funding announced today is a part of the $4.7 billion orphan wells clean up program established under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and will be available to states to identify and plug orphaned wells, remediate and reclaim lands impacted by oil and gas development activities, and remove infrastructure associated with the wells. The 26 states eligible for this funding collectively represent nearly every state with documented orphan wells in the country. State-by-state funding totals can be found here.

Washington Post: Biden administration to give states $1.15 billion to plug orphaned wells, which leak planet-warming methane[Tik Root, 1/31/22]
The White House on Monday announced new steps to help curb emissions of methane, saying it will send $1.15 billion to states to clean up thousands of orphaned oil and gas wells that leak the powerful planet-warming gas. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement that the new funding "is enabling us to confront the legacy pollution and long-standing environmental injustices" that have long plagued vulnerable communities. "This is good for our climate, for the health of our communities, and for American workers," Haaland said. The Interior Department reported earlier this month that there are 130,000 documented abandoned wells across the country. And, an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund and McGill University found that about 9 million people in the United States live within a mile of an orphaned well. As recently as 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the number could actually be as high as 2 million to 3 million.
Reuters: U.S. unveils $1.15 bln for abandoned oil and gas well clean-up[1/31/22]
The Biden administration on Monday said it would make $1.15 billion available to states to clean up abandoned oil and gas wells as part of a broad effort to reduce U.S. climate warming emissions and improve health and safety in nearby communities. The money represents a portion of the $4.7 billion for well clean-up that was included in the infrastructure law passed in Congress last year. The program is a pillar of U.S. President Joe Biden's pledge that fighting climate change will create jobs and revitalize neighborhoods harmed by aging fossil fuel infrastructure. The White House said 26 states were eligible to apply for the funding, or nearly every state that has documented orphaned wells, defined as wells with an owner that is either unknown or insolvent … The abandoned well funding is one of several federal efforts the White House laid out on Monday that are aimed at reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. They include a Department of Transportation initiative to require pipeline operators to reduce methane emissions across their systems, and a Department of Energy program to offer technical assistance to well plugging efforts.
CNN: Biden administration to offer $1.2 billion for states to clean up planet-warming methane leaks[Ella Nilsen, 1/31/22]
The Biden administration is taking steps to cut emissions of methane, a potent, planet-warming gas. Addressing methane emissions — which can come from old, leaking oil and gas wells and poorly maintained natural gas pipes — has been a priority for President Joe Biden, who last year pledged to slash fossil fuel emissions in an effort to mitigate the climate crisis. "This is something that creates jobs; it can create jobs in the hardest hit areas," the senior administration official said. "It can do all of that while bending the curve on emissions, and in particular, these super-polluting emissions." 
KATC 3 (ABC Lafayette, LA): Louisiana to receive funding to address orphan wells through Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill[1/31/22]
The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) will allocate to Louisiana $47,396,249 in Phase One formula funding and initial grants to plug and restore orphaned oil and gas wells. Louisiana is expected to receive a total of $111,449,520 in funding from the IIJA for orphan wells … According to Senator Bill Cassidy, Louisiana could also be eligible to receive further funding through the bipartisan infrastructure bill's $1.5 billion state Performance Grant program. "I've heard from communities across Louisiana about the environmental and safety hazards of orphan wells," Cassidy said. "This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Package will create jobs, help state officials address these wells and make Louisiana a cleaner place to live. In addition, the land around these wells can be repurposed and lead to an economic boost."

They expect the funding to create union jobs, catalyze economic growth and reduce methane leaks."
The Paper (Albuquerque): NM To Receive Millions in Fed Funding To Clean Up Orphaned Oil Wells[Tierna Unruh-Enos, 1/31/22]

New Mexico is eligible for up to $25 million. "The Department is taking a thoughtful and methodical approach to implementing the orphaned oil and gas well program that aims to get money to states as quickly as possible while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. We are committed to ensuring states receive investments equitably and based on data-driven needs," added Haaland. These resources will allow state officials to begin building out their plugging programs, remediating high-priority wells, and collecting additional data regarding the number of orphaned wells in their states…. The Tribal orphaned well grant program, a $150 million component of the broader orphaned well program, is being informed by ongoing Tribal consultations and listening sessions. The law also provides for a separate $250 million program for remediation of orphan wells on federal land, which will be implemented through the Interior's Bureau of Land Management.
