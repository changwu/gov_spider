    May I just say that it's a great honor for me as President of the United States to receive His All Holiness in the Oval Office. And as I survey the changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe and around the world, my thoughts go to the faith of individuals in so many countries, a faith that is sustained and strengthened by the church and by the leadership of His All Holiness. And so, it is appropriate to be received respectfully in the Oval Office, and that I have an opportunity to tell him that I see faith of people as a driving force for change in the world today and have an opportunity to salute him for his principles and leadership.
So, it's been a joy to have you here, a joy to have you here. And to have the various metropolitans [ecclesiastical officials] here, too, is special. Thank you all.
