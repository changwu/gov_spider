    I feel a special pride and nostalgia each year as I issue this message designating October as "Country Music Month."
Growing up on a farm, I learned to appreciate firsthand the sounds coming from the fields, hills and valleys of our country during harvest season. I grew to know and share the emotions, hopes and dreams of the men, women and children of rural America. And every time I listen to Country music I am reminded of the timeless values by which they live.
During this traditional observance, I want to salute Country music as the purest echo of rural America at work to help build the progress and well-being of our land.
This is why I welcome this opportunity to applaud the gifted artists who devote their finest talents to ensure our continued enjoyment of Country music and the dedicated fellow 'citizens who bring their performances to the widest possible audiences.
