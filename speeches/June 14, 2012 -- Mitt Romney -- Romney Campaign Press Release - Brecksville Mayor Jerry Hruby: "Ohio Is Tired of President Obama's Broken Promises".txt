    Jerry Hruby, the Mayor of Brecksville, Ohio, made the following statement on President Obama's visit to Cleveland:
"President Obama never fails to disappoint. He's come to Ohio many times and, each time he visits, he promises that things will get better. Unfortunately, all we can count on is that he will soon return, making the same promises and delivering the same lack of results. President Obama's policies have not worked. Four more years of the same would be bad for Ohio and devastating for America. In November, Ohioans will have the chance to get our country back on track by supporting Mitt Romney, who has the plans and experience to get the job done."
