    Today the group of Virginia leaders endorsing John Kasich for President expanded to include eight local officials: Fairfax County Supervisor John C. Cook, Prince William County Supervisor Marty Nohe, Virginia Beach Vice Mayor Louis R. Jones, Virginia Beach Councilwoman Rosemary Wilson, Virginia Beach Councilman Jim Wood, Vienna Town Councilman Pasha M. Majdi, former Fairfax County Supervisor Christine R. Trapnell, and Brigadier General Tip Osterthaler (USAF-Ret.), President and CEO of SES Government Solutions.
Former U.S. Congressman Tom Davis serves as Virginia State Honorary Chair of Kasich for America.
"Governor Kasich's ideas for balancing our federal budget, restoring fiscal responsibility, and strengthening our national defense are really making an impact on leaders at the local level," said Davis, who was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 1998 to 2002. "It's exciting to see our leadership team grow in strength and numbers here in Virginia."
"It's a real honor to welcome these new additions to our team in Virginia," said Kasich. "Each of them brings valuable experience and a unique perspective to the table. The momentum that is building around the state speaks to the strong leadership of Tom Davis and the way our message is resonating with voters."
