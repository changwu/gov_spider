    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Demings, D-FL, and 37 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 5768, the Violent Incident Clearance and Technological Investigative Methods (VICTIM) Act of 2022.
Half of gun homicides in the United States remain unsolved, and victims of non-fatal shootings too often lack the support they need to recover. H.R. 5768 would authorize $1 billion in appropriations for a new Department of Justice grant program to help State, Tribal, and local law enforcement agencies hire, train, and retain detectives and victim services personnel to investigate unsolved homicides and non-fatal shootings. The bill would provide resources to help process and analyze forensic evidence, bring perpetrators to justice, and enhance supportive services for victims. The bill would require grantees to report how these investments impact their rates of solving homicides and non-fatal shootings.
As communities continue to experience the scourge of gun violence every day, the Administration calls on Congress to swiftly pass this life-saving legislation.
