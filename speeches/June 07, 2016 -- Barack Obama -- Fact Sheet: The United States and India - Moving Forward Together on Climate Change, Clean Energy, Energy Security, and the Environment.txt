    Recognizing the critical importance of increasing energy access, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving resilience in the face of climate change, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi committed in September 2014 to a new and enhanced strategic partnership on energy security, clean energy, and climate change. Since that time, the United States and India have made important strides together to advance this strategic partnership, and to our related cooperation on environmental stewardship.
Global Leadership on Climate Change and Clean Energy
In recognition of the urgent threat of climate change, the United States and India recognize the urgency of the threat of climate change and are therefore committed to bringing the Paris Agreement into force as quickly as possible. The United States reaffirms its commitment to join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible this year. India similarly has begun its processes to work toward this shared goal.
In addition, the two sides plan to work together to adopt in 2016 an ambitious amendment to phase-down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons - a potent greenhouse gas - under the Montreal Protocol, which could avoid a half-degree of temperature increase. By avoiding up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century, an HFC Amendment is one of the most consequential actions we can take to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, the United States and India committed to work together to reach a successful resolution to address greenhouse gas emissions from international civil aviation at the upcoming International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly.
The United States welcomes the launch of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and recognizes the critical role it can play in the development and deployment of solar power. Demonstrating support for the ISA, the United States and India plan to jointly launch an effort to promote access to off-grid solar power.
The Government of India has been a strong partner in the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), a forum of the world's major economies, working together to drive the transition to clean energy. India has demonstrated how international collaboration, such as efforts to establish lighting test standards through the CEM's appliance efficiency initiative, can lead to huge benefits. India's domestic efficient lighting program, which has deployed over 100 million efficient LEDs, inspired the CEM's Global Lighting Challenge.
A Strengthened and Expanded U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy
In September 2014, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi pledged to strengthen and expand the highly successful U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE). Since then, the two countries have made important progress and have launched important new activities to advance both countries' ambitious clean energy objectives and Nationally Determined Contributions.
