    The United States strongly condemns the decision by President Yahya Jammeh of The Gambia to ignore the will of the Gambian people in calling for the December 1 election to be nullified. It is imperative that President Jammeh, who previously accepted the results of the election, retract his call for a new vote and pledge to facilitate a peaceful and democratic transition to President-elect Adama Barrow. The United States appeals to all Gambians to reject violence and seek a peaceful resolution that upholds the will of the Gambian people and advances the promise of a freer, more democratic, and more prosperous Gambia. We call specifically on The Gambia's security services to uphold their sacred duty to protect all Gambians and reject any instruction to suppress peaceful expressions of dissent. As we closely monitor the situation, we will work with our international partners to help ensure that there is accountability for any persons who use violence to undermine the peaceful democratic transition that the people of The Gambia both demanded and deserve.
