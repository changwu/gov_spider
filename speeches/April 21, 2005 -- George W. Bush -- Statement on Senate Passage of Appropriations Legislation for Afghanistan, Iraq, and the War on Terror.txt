    I applaud the Senate for its strong bipartisan support for our troops and our continued effort to win the war on terror. New democracies are taking root in Iraq and Afghanistan, and America is proud to stand with them. Both countries are assuming greater responsibility for their own security, which will help our troops return home as quickly as possible with the honor they have earned. I urge the House and Senate to reach a final agreement that focuses taxpayer dollars on providing the tools our troops and diplomats need now, so that I can sign a bill into law as soon as possible.
