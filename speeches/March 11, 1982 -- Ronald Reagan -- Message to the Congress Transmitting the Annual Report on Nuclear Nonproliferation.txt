    To the Congress of the United States:
My policy statement on non-proliferation and peaceful nuclear cooperation last July highlighted the key elements of continuity in United States policy to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives and those areas where we need to adopt new directions or different approaches. We will continue our efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and the framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation, and we look forward to working closely with Congress toward these shared objectives.
I am pleased to submit the fourth annual report called for by Section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-242). This report which covers calendar year 1981 has been prepared by the Department of State in collaboration with other concerned departments and agencies.
