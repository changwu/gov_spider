    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 4334, the "Supporting Older Americans Act of 2020" (the "Act"). Section 127 of the Act requires the Assistant Secretary for Aging of the Department of Health and Human Services to appoint a person to a position that may qualify as an inferior office under the Appointments Clause. My Administration will interpret section 127 in a manner that ensures that this appointment is made consistent with the Constitution.
DONALD J. TRUMP
