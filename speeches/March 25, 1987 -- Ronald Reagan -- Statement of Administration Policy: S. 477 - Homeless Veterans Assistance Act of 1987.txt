    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)((Cranston (D) CA and five others)
The administration opposes S. 477, whose primary purpose is to authorize certain new programs for homeless veterans. This bill is unnecessary and duplicative in view of (a) ongoing efforts of the Veterans Administration, including extensive outreach programs and various initiatives, (b) extensive direct efforts by the Federal Government as a whole to aid the homeless, including veterans, and (c) Federal funding of efforts by State and local governments, which have the major responsibility and capability for dealing with their homeless populations. This bill would also extend the Veterans Job Training Act, which should be allowed to expire in light of the improvement in the veterans' unemployment rate and the administration's Worker Readjustment proposal, which would be available to assist unemployed veterans.
