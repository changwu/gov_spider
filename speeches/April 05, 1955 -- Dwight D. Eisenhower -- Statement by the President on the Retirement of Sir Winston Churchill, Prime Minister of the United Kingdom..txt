    WE HAVE just had official word that my old and very dear friend, Sir Winston Churchill, has retired from his position as head of Her Majesty's government in the United Kingdom.
Naturally, an event such as this recalls to my mind many stirring incidents both of war and peace. I have greatly respected and valued my associations with a man so great as Winston Churchill.
And now, if I dare, I should like to address a word directly to Sir Winston. All of us in the free world can respect your decision, Sir Winston, to retire from official office, to live now a somewhat more serene life than has been possible in a position of such great responsibility as yours. But we shall never accept the thought that we are to be denied your counsel, your advice. Out of your great experience, your great wisdom, and your great courage, the free world yet has much to gain, and we know that you will never be backward in bringing those qualities forward when we appeal to you for help, as all of us are bound to do.
Good luck to you in retirement. To you and your family all the happiness that it is possible for you to have.
Now for the rest of us, I hope that I have spoken the words you would like to speak, no matter how haltingly or how roughly. Thank you.
