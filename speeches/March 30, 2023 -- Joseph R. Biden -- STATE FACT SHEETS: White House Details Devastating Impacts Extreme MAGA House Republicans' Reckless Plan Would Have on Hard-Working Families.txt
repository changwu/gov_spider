    Cuts would endanger public safety and worsen public health, raise costs for families and students, and harm seniors and veteransâ€”while multi-millionaires and big corporations would get massive tax cuts
Today, the White House released 51 state and territory fact sheets highlighting the devastating impacts of extreme MAGA House Republicans' reckless plan to gut critical support for hardworking families while delivering massive tax breaks for the super wealthy and big corporations.
This week, Speaker McCarthy doubled down on holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage and risking economic chaos and catastrophe in order to force draconian cuts that will endanger public safety and worsen public health, raise costs for families and students, and harm seniors and veterans. The House Freedom Caucus was quick to praise Speaker McCarthy's proposal as consistent with their own, which would slash critical investments in hard-working families by roughly 20%. What's more, House Republicans are demanding these reckless cuts while advancing trillions in deficit-increasing tax cuts skewed to the super wealthy and big corporations.
That's in sharp contrast with President Biden's Budget, which invests in America, lowers costs for families, protects and strengthens Medicare and Social Security, and reduces the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over 10 years, while ensuring no one making less than $400,000 per year pays a penny more in new taxes.

This analysis assumes an across-the-board reduction of roughly 22% compared to currently enacted FY 2023 levels for non-defense discretionary accounts. That aligns with Congressional Republican proposals to return discretionary spending to FY 2022 levels on an ongoing basis while exempting defense spending.
