GRAHAM ON PRESIDENT OBAMA SENDING TROOPS TO SYRIA WITHOUT A PLAN TO DEGRADE AND DESTROY ISIL:
"This Is - In My View - An Incremental Change That Will Not Change The Conditions On The Ground." "You need a no fly-zone inside of Syria for the refugee problem so people don't have to flee their country and you need a place where you can train soldiers. A no fly-zone allows you to do that with safety and security. This is, in my view, an incremental change that will not change the conditions on the ground. In the eyes of the enemy, this is weakness. In the eyes of our allies, this is unreliability. ISIL is not going to be intimidated by this move." (Andrea Mitchell Reports, "Graham: Isis will not be intimidated by this," MSNBC, 10/30/15)
"President Obama's Done The Worst Thing You Could Possibly Do As Commander-In-Chief. He's Put 50 Brave Americans At Risk Without Any Hope Of Success." "The goal of degrading and destroying ISIL is the right goal. This move will not advance the cause. In fact, it undercuts our efforts. Because in the eyes of the enemy, sending 50 soldiers proves to them how weak President Obama is. That he's really not all in regarding their destruction...This is actually a giant step backwards." (Happening Now, "#4Questions for Sen. Lindsey Graham," FOX News, 10/30/15)
"ISIL's going to hit us if we don't hit them first...They want three things. They want to purify their faith - they're destroying the Christian religion also, they want to destroy Israel and hit us... Al Baghdadi said 'I'll see you in New York.' So, it's a direct threat to our homeland."
(Andrea Mitchell Reports, "Graham: Isis will not be intimidated by this," MSNBC, 10/30/15)
"I Would Use [The Region's] Armies To Supplement The Free Syrian Army. We'd Be About 10% Of The Force And I'd Go In On The Ground And Destroy These Bastards."

GRAHAM ON SECRETARY KERRY PARTICIPATING IN TALKS IN VIENNA:
"John Kerry is about to hand Syria over to Russia and Iran." "Guess how these negotiations are going to end when Assad has no military threat against him any longer because of Russia and Iran. Iran's influence in Syria is going to be through the roof, Russia's presence in the region is going to be enhanced, Assad is going to be left in place or a proxy of Assad will be left in place" (Andrea Mitchell Reports, "Graham: Isis will not be intimidated by this," MSNBC, 10/30/15)
"What You See In The Ukraine, What You See In China, What You Now See In Syria, Is Our Adversaries Are Walking All Over A Weak President."
