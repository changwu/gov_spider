    Congressman Gilman and all of you who I know have such a deep concern and personal interest in a matter which concerns me as well as your fellow Americans:
I welcome you to Washington, and I am honored and pleased to have the opportunity of meeting with you just for a few minutes.
I am meeting with a group from your organization--I think it is next Tuesday afternoon--and I look forward at that time to talking in depth with your representatives as to what we can do despite the overwhelming odds against us.
I can assure you that your Government will maximize its efforts despite the serious problems that we have. And I know there is a proposal, or maybe more than one, in the Congress to set up a commission or a committee.
We have been working with people from your organization. I have nothing but the greatest admiration and affection for you, and we in the White House will do everything we possibly can to get what information to make sure and certain that in good conscience you can believe that your Government has done for you what is right, and we will make sure of that.
I am delighted to see you, and I was very pleased to have a chance to Stop in when I learned that all of you were here.
Good luck. God bless you.
