    "In no region of the world is our country's influence any stronger than it was four years ago. President Obama has failed to restore our economy, is weakening our military with devastating defense cuts, and has diminished our moral authority. Governor Romney will restore the pillars of American strength to secure our interests and defend our values." —Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

Meanwhile, Looming Sequestration Threatens Our Military:

The proposed 2013 budget represents the Pentagon's first installment in a plan to reduce its projected spending by $487 billion over 10 years. Congress must approve the changes."

Mitt Romney Opposes Sequestration — As President, He Will Ensure Our Military Remains The Strongest In The World:
Governor Romney Will Oppose Obama-Era Defense Cuts And Strengthen Our Military. "Unfortunately, the Obama Administration has taken actions that will only undermine the alliance. The U.S. military is facing nearly $1 trillion in cuts over the next ten years. And President Obama has sent the message—intentionally or not—that the worth of NATO has diminished in America's eyes. At this moment of both opportunities and perils, the NATO alliance must retain the capacity to act. As president, I will work closely with our partners to bolster the alliance. I will reverse Obama-era military cuts." (Mitt Romney, Statement, 5/18/12)
