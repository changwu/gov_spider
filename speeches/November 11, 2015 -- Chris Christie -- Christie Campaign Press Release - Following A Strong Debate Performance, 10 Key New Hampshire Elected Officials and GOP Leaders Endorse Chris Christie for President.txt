MORRISTOWN, NJ - Following Governor Christie's strong performance in the fourth Republican Presidential debate, ten additional key New Hampshire elected officials and Republican leaders endorsed his campaign, providing additional momentum in the first in the nation primary state. These endorsements come less than a week after public polling showed Governor Christie quadrupling his support in the Granite State.
Merrimack County Attorney Scott Murray said, "Governor Christie has earned the respect and vote of those in law enforcement. He will bring a new approach to how we treat drug addiction and by energizing Federal drug enforcement policy, will ensure that 'justice' is more than just a word, but a way of life."
State Representative Jim Grenier stated, "After thoughtful consideration, I am supporting Governor Christie because of his character and his ability to be a successful leader of our country." Grenier continued, "After meeting him and his wife Mary Pat, I am sure Governor Christie is 'one of us' and will stand up for all citizens. Unlike politicians in Washington, DC, Governor Christie has the record of being able to bring folks together to get things done."
Bedford Town Council Vice Chair Kelleigh Murphy, a former state representative and Manchester Alderman who also served as press secretary for former US Senator Bob Smith commented, "From a 19 trillion dollar debt to the scourge of drug addiction tearing apart communities, our country is facing monumental problems. Governor Christie has the courage to address the most pressing issues affecting our nation and his candor is exactly what we need in these difficult times. I support Governor Christie for President because he will be the strong leader who can restore America to prosperity and provide a nation of opportunity for future generations."
