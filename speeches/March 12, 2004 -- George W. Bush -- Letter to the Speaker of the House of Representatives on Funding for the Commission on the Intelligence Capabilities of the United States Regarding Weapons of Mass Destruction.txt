    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I am notifying the Congress of my intent to use funds provided in Public Law 107- 38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, for the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (the "Commission").
At this time, $4 million will be transferred from the Emergency Response Fund for the Commission. As provided in Public Law 107-38, these funds will be made available to the Commission immediately.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
