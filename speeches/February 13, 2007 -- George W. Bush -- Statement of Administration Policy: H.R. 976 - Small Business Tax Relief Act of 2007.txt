    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Rangel (D) New York and Rep. McCrery (R) Louisiana)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 976 as a step toward legislation to increase the minimum wage by $2.10 over two years, but believes the bill should be strengthened by adding additional small business tax relief to mitigate potential job loss. As the President said on December 20, 2006, a minimum wage bill should "not punish the millions of small businesses that are creating most of the new jobs in our country." The bill should therefore pair the increase in the minimum wage with greater tax relief to help small businesses stay competitive and to help keep our economy creating jobs, as the Senate bill did by providing $8.3 billion in small business tax relief. The Administration does not think it is necessary to tie this small business tax relief to revenue increases.
