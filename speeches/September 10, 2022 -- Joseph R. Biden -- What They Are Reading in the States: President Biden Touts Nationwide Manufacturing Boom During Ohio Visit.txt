    ''Intel breaks ground on massive project; Biden, others hail Silicon Heartland launch''Wolfspeed announces $5 billion investment in Chatham County, largest in NC history'
This week, local news outlets are reporting about how President Biden's economic plan has led to a nationwide manufacturing boom that is creating good-paying jobs in communities across the U.S.
On Friday, President Biden traveled to Licking County, Ohio and declared: "'Made in Ohio' and 'Made in America' is no longer just a slogan. It's happening," said President Biden. "Folks, the future of the chip industry is going to be made in America."
During his visit, he joined with Intel and Ohio leaders for the groundbreaking of a new semiconductor chip manufacturing facility that will create over 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full time jobs. The commitment from Intel was made possible by passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which President Biden signed into law a few weeks ago.
During the speech, the President also highlighted the latest string of manufacturing investments by companies across the U.S., including Wolfspeed, which announced Friday that they will invest $5 billion to build a new silicon chip factory that will create 1,800 good-paying jobs in North Carolina.
