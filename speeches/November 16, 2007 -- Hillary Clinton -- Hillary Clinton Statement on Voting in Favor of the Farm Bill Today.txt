    Senator Hillary Clinton released the following statement on her vote in favor of the Farm Bill:
"This morning, I was proud to vote in favor of Senator Harkin's Farm Bill the most significant piece of legislation for rural America that Congress has considered in recent years. Under the threat of a veto from President Bush, 43 Republicans chose to oppose this bill, enough to prevent the bill from moving forward. When I am President, I'll be a champion for family farmers instead of leaving them out in the cold."
