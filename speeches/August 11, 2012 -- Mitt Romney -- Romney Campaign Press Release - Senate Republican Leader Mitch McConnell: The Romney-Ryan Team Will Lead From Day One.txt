    Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Gov. Romney showed today that he is determined to confront a host of growing crises that President Obama has ignored. Where the current President has simply refused to act, Gov. Romney has now pledged to lead. Paul Ryan is an excellent choice, and a confirmation that Gov. Romney is serious about strengthening America's economic future, tackling the deficits and debt that have skyrocketed under President Obama, and returning to a path to solvency and security.
"Americans are looking for leadership that has been lacking on the most critical issues facing our country's economic future. The Romney-Ryan team can return much-needed leadership from day one and help bring real recovery to our economy, reverse the damage of the Obama economy, and take a serious approach to the Obama debt and focus on growing jobsâ€”not the size of the government.
"President Obama's term has been marked by overwhelming national debt, a first-ever downgrade of America's credit rating, high unemployment and a disappointing lack of leadership when it comes to addressing spending. It's time to change that, and Gov. Romney and Chairman Ryan will be ready on day one to give America the leadership it deserves."
