It is imperative to restore the economic foundations for America's families and small businesses. In addition to rapid and targeted help for those families hurt by the mortgage crisis, it is essential to reduce the burdens on businesses and workers by lowering taxes, streamlining regulation, tackling health care costs, opening markets to American goods and helping those workers in need. Today's news also underlines the need to focus on innovation, which grows the economy and creates an urgent need for effective worker re-training.
"Despite today's news, the Democrats will continue to advance their anti-growth agenda. The American people cannot afford the Democrats and their economic leadership. Washington must not be an obstacle to economic growth and robust job creation."
