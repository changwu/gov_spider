    First Installment Includes Anthony Hamilton, Kesha, Los Lobos, Ben Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service, Harlem Gospel Travelers, and Misterwives
Today, Biden for President announced the start of a new online concert series titled Team Joe Sings. Each Thursday at 8 PM ET/5 PM PT, a new batch of artists will perform two songs virtually in support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
This first week's artists include brand new performances from pop star Kesha and Grammy-Award winning artist Anthony Hamilton, in addition to previously posted performances by Latin legends Los Lobos, beloved alternative artist Ben Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service, the Harlem Gospel Choir, and indie pop band Misterwives.
"We need change and we need it now. Our current President has proven over and over that he lacks basic empathy and honesty," says pop artist Kesha. "I love this country and I think we deserve better. In our Declaration of Independence it says "all men are created equal" it was a nice start, but now we know we need to give all people equal rights, protection, and opportunity no matter what they look like or who they love. I believe Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can help us win this fight for equality."
Performances will be streamed on each artist's YouTube page:

Kesha 
Anthony Hamilton 
Los Lobos 
Ben Gibbard 
The Postal Service 
Harlem Gospel Choir 
Misterwives 

More performances will be featured every Thursday until the election on November 3rd.
