    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to the requirements of section 310(a)(2)(B) of the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (title III, Public Law 103-236), I am pleased to transmit a Plan for the Consolidation of United States Government International Broadcasting.
The Plan reflects my continued strong commitment to the use of international radio and television as methods for advancing democracy and enlarging the community of free-market nations.
I look forward to working with the Congress on this and other issues in the months ahead.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
