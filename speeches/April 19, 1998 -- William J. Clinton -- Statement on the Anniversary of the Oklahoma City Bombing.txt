    Three years ago today the people of Oklahoma City suffered the worst act of terrorism in our country's history. It was an attack not just on the people, a city, a State, a nation, but on what we stand for, how we govern ourselves, and the values we live by. During that time, we have worked to bring to justice those who were responsible for this crime. And during that time, all America has stood by the people of Oklahoma City as they have worked to rebuild their lives. Today, once again, our thoughts are with the families of the 168 people whose lives were tragically lost. Their courage and the resilience of Oklahoma City has shown us all the full meaning of community.
