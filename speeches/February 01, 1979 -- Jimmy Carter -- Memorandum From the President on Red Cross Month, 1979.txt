    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I have just signed a Presidential Proclamation designating the month of March as Red Cross Month.
For almost 100 years the American people have been counting on the Red Cross for disaster relief, the collection and distribution of blood, services to members of the armed forces, their families and veterans, first aid and water safety instruction and a wide variety of community health programs.
There are three things we can do to help the Red Cross during March:1. Become a Red Cross volunteer2. Donate blood
3. Support our Red Cross chapter's membership enrollment efforts.
The Red Cross is a part of the Combined Federal Campaign for Federal employees, but more than half of its 3,000 chapters raise all their funds in March. All chapters use the month to inform the public of Red Cross services available to citizens and to recruit new blood donors and volunteers.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Gross, I urge all civilian employees of the Federal government and members of the armed forces to support this vital voluntary effort to the best of their ability.
JIMMY CARTER
