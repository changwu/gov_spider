    The Daily Caller reports on a new Iowa poll that has Newt in second place, ahead of Mitt Romney.
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has jumped into second place in Iowa, ahead of Mitt Romney, according to a poll released Monday.
An automated poll conducted by We Ask America, found that 18 percent of likely caucus goers would vote for Gingrich if the caucuses were held today. Cain is still in first place with 22 percent, despite weathering a week of sexual harassment allegations. Gingrich edges out Mitt Romney, who is in third at 15 percent.
Gingrich has witnessed large gains since his numbers dropped and his staff deserted over the summer.
The survey was taken on Sunday, after a full week of the sexual harassment charges against Cain being front and center in the news, yet voters don't appear to be withdrawing support, for now at least.
Other polls in recent weeks have found Gingrich coming up in the polls. Since the beginning of October, Gingrich has begun to steadily climb in Iowa, and consistently sits at about ten percent in the polls. An Insider Advantage poll released Thursday found Gingrich in third at 12 percent.
