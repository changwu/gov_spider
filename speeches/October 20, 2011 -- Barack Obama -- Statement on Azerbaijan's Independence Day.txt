    On behalf of the American people, I want to extend my best wishes to all those who are celebrating Azerbaijan's Independence Day in Azerbaijan, in the United States, and around the world. This 20th anniversary of independence and Azerbaijan's achievements during this time demonstrate the extraordinary promise and determination of the Azeri people. The United States is committed to developing greater opportunities to work with the Government and people of Azerbaijan.
