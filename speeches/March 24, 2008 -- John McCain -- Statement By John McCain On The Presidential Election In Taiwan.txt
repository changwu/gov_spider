    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S.
Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on the elections in Taiwan:
"I want to congratulate MaYing-jeou of Taiwan on his victory in the presidential election held on March 22nd. Once again we are witnessing the peaceful transfer of political power from one government to another based on ballots in an election that was free and fair. The vigorous campaigning of Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT and the DPP's Frank Hsieh are testimony to the press freedoms, democratic process and the rule of law the Taiwanese people have worked so hard to build. Taiwan's election is a fine example for the region.
