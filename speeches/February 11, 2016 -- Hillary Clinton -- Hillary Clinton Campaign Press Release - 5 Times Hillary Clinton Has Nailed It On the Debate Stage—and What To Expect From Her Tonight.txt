    
She's got this.
Hillary Clinton is gearing up to take the stage in the sixth Democratic debate of the presidential primary. And if her past performances are any indication, it's safe to say she's got this. Here are the five moments from previous debates that perfectly sum up her campaign.
1. She's always the first—and often the only—candidate to stand up to Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood. 

2. She has clear, detailed policy plans—and she's always specific about how she'll make them a reality.

3. She's never afraid to take on the gun lobby—and she does it again, and again, and again.

  "It's time the entire country stands up against the @NRA!" @HillaryClinton #DemDebate YES!!!— Lynn Margherita (@lemnosalt) October 14, 2015

4. She brings up the issues that are missing from the conversation ...


  " We didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities."


  It's important to note @HillaryClinton was the only person to bring up the deep inequities facing LGBT people #DemDebate #ImWithHer— Ted Hanson (@tjh_32) February 5, 2016

... and she's doing everything she can to bring national attention to injustices like the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. 



  Flint ignored bc poor/black. ICYMI: Flint Mayor endorsed .@HillaryClinton bc Hillary will fight for them + their kids #ImWithHer #DemDebate— Sergio Grant (@sgrant525) February 5, 2016

5. When it comes being a progressive champion, her record speaks for itself.
