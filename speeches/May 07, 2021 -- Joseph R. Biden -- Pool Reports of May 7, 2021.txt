In-town print pool report #14: Secretaries' gaggle 
Treasury Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm spoke to the press for a few minutes outside the West Wing entrance following the Jobs Cabinet meeting with the president and the vice president. HHS Secretary Marcia Fudge was also there but did not speak.
Raimondo said the meeting ran a little over an hour.
Some highlights from the gaggle:
--Walsh said they talked about the American Jobs Plan and what it would do for the American people and the economy. He said the president again stressed the importance of the plan as an infrastructure plan that's not just about roads and bridges, but also about people.
--Raimondo: "It was a terrific meeting with the president." She said she updated the president on her efforts to reach out to Congress and the business community, with a particular focus on broadband. She said every governor she has spoken to, Democrat and Republican alike, have agreed on the importance of having broadband in every community.
--Buttigieg said the meeting was a good opportunity to update the president on what he has been hearing and seeing around the country in terms of transportation infrastructure. "There's clearly bipartisan interest and enthusiasm to do big things in infrastructure and transportation," he said. "It's often said that this is a competitive business. We see allies and strategic competitors like China making a major investment in their transportation infrastructure. We have got to make sure America doesn't fall behind."
--Granholm on whether the administration can win Republican support: She said there are energy components of the plan that Republicans in the Senate say will they support, such as the ability to have carbon capture and sequestration. "You see people who have -- Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the Senate -- who have voted in the past for some of these energy measures." There is optimism that there will agreement on large parts of the plan, she said.

In-town print pool report #14(b): Correction 
Pete Buttigieg is transportation secretary, obviously. Your pooler hastily – and erroneously -- gave him the treasury secretary’s job in pool report #14.
Again, apologies.



May 7, 202120:02

In-town print pool report #14(c): Correction 
Another correction to pool report #14, which referred to Marcia Fudge as HHS secretary. She’s HUD secretary, obviously.
Most of you know that, of course. Your pooler knows it, too. But sometimes his fingers work faster than his brain.

In-town print pool report #15: Next week's meetings 
Background from a White House official:
Next week, the President will continue to engage with Members of Congress around the American Jobs Plan.
On Wednesday, May 12, the President will meet with bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate: Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, and Leader McCarthy. They will have a dialogue about policy areas of mutual agreement and identifying common ground on which they can work together and deliver results on the challenges facing American families.
The President is eager to talk in-person with the Congressional leaders about how they can partner on the goals of restoring trust in government, ensuring that government delivers for the American people, and keeping the nation safe and competitive in the world—especially as the nation continues to sacrifice to defeat the pandemic and we turn our economy around after the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
On Thursday, May 13, the President and Senator Capito will continue their negotiations about the best ways to invest in American infrastructure.
President Biden will host Senator Capito at the White House, joined by a number of additional Republican Senators who serve as ranking members of relevant committees: Senator Barrasso, Senator Blunt, Senator Crapo, Senator Toomey, and Senator Wicker.
The President appreciates their engagement and the ongoing dialogue on this high priority, and is looking forward to speaking with the group.
