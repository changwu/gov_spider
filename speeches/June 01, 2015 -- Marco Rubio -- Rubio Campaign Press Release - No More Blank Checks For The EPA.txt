It is especially costly for small and new businesses that cannot afford the costs of hiring a lawyer to help them comply with complicated regulations These regulations, and the new ones that keep showing up, also create uncertainty.
A prime example of these costly, unnecessary regulations is the EPA's Clean Water Rule. We want to know that our drinking water is clean, but this goes too far in trying to regulate bodies of water as small as ponds on private property.
This hurts our farmers, small businesses and manufacturers who cannot bear the burden of another tax disguised as a mandatory regulation.
One of the best ways I know to ease this burden on the American people is to force federal agencies to enact only those regulations that serve an essential role. There will be no more blank checks for regulators and the lawmakers who enable them.
