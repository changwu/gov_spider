(4) the relationship between outdoor recreation and personal and public health, the economy, and the environment;
(5) the future needs of outdoor recreation management systems, including qualified personnel, technical information, and anticipated financial needs;
(6) the relationship of outdoor recreation to the broader range of recreation pursuits and its implications for the supply of and demand for outdoor recreation resources and opportunities;
(7) underlying social, economic, and technological factors that are likely to affect the demand for and supply of outdoor recreation resources, including trends in disposable income and demographic characteristics of the United States;
(8) the findings and recommendations of the National Urban Recreation Study (1978), the Third Nationwide Outdoor Recreation Plan (1979), the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Actâ€”Assessment Supplement (1984), and other relevant Federal survey and planning activities.
