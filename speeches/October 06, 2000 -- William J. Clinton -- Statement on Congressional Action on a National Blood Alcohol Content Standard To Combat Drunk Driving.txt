    I congratulate the Congress for passing landmark legislation today that will help save lives by keeping drunk drivers off the road. Earlier today the Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill that will help establish the first-ever national drunk driving standard at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC). This groundbreaking measure, which I have long advocated, will save hundreds of lives a year and represents a major victory for public safety and American families all across the country.
