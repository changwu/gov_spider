The United States has been experiencing, believe it or not, Historically Low Crime Rates. The last thing we will be doing is Defunding or Eliminating our many and various Police Departments or, putting an end to our great Second Amendment!Retweets: 24591Favorites: 105388

"It's a trap because they want to tank the economy and make everything look trrrible so they can make President Trump look bad in November. They want Trump to have to send in troops so it looks bad for him." Dave Rubin, author of "Don't Burn This Book." @seanhannityRetweets: 20094Favorites: 74065

If I didn't demand that National Guard Troops go into Minneapolis after watching how poorly the Liberal Democrat government was handling things, you wouldn't even have a Minneapolis now. Once they were deployed, in force, all looting, burning and crime stopped DEAD!Retweets: 20345Favorites: 86904

Minnesota, we need Lacy Johnson in Washington, D.C. Has my Complete and Total Endorsement. He's tough and smart - and loves Minnesota. Look at the MESS you just went through - No more.

.@CNN should move Fredo back to the morning slot. He was rewarded for bad ratings with a much better time slot - and again got really bad ratings. Getting totally trounced by @FoxNews. Give him another shot in the morning - He would easily beat Morning Joe's poorly rated show!Retweets: 14836Favorites: 64729

Mail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election. Look at all of the cases and examples that are out there right now, with the Patterson, N.J., being the most recent example. Republicans, in particular, cannot let this happen!Retweets: 30756Favorites: 107051
