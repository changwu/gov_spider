I met Marine Sgt. John Peck a quadruple amputee who has received a double arm transplant at Walter Reed in 2017. Today it was my honor to welcome John (HERO) to the Oval with his wonderful wife Jessica. He also wrote a book that I highly recommend 'Rebuilding Sergeant Peck.' https://t.co/eiNnHcEU7xRetweets: 21407Favorites: 97750

In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on 'dumped' steel from China & other countries and we now have a big and growing industry. We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong!Retweets: 18806Favorites: 80684

China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 Billion Dollars so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China.....Retweets: 19724Favorites: 93932

....so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers. We are now a much bigger economy than China and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the 'piggy bank' that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!Retweets: 14440Favorites: 71829

We can make a deal with China tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal. No way! We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made. Will be taking in.....Retweets: 16000Favorites: 76216

Billions of Dollars and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong. Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don't want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action. This should have been done by our leaders many years ago. Enjoy!Retweets: 14626Favorites: 70727

When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but as I have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn't make any sense. We have to be allowed to make up some.....Retweets: 20249Favorites: 107048

....of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO. It will all happen and much faster than people think!Retweets: 15508Favorites: 85117

Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy......Retweets: 15910Favorites: 78617

....This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China and others to do business with us. The Farmers have been 'forgotten' for many years. Their time is now!Retweets: 13781Favorites: 68891

China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a 'match' it would be game over we win! In any event China wants a deal!Retweets: 17219Favorites: 72628
