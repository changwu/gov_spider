Governor Romney Believes We Must Defeat The Jihadist Threat:
Governor Romney: "Of course we get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted on America. ... We'll move everything to get him. But I don't want to buy into the Democratic pitch, that this is all about one person, Osama bin Laden. Because after we get him, there's going to be another and another. ... This is a global effort we're going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort. It's more than Osama bin Laden. But he is going to pay, and he will die."

Governor Romney Warns Of The Dangers Of Withdrawing From Iraq:
Governor Romney: "With regards to Iraq, there are a lot of people that say, let's just get out. I want to get our troops home as soon as I possibly can. But at the same time I recognize, we don't want to bring them out in such a precipitous way that we cause a circumstance that would require us to come back. Because if we leave in the wrong way, the Iranians could grab the Shi'a South, or al Qaeda could play a dominant role among the Sunnis. Or you could have the border with Turkey destabilized by the Kurds, and as a result you could have regional conflict develop. But with that occurring, you could have our neighbors get involved, our friends get involved around Iraq, and we could have to come back again."
