    In 1999, Governor Jeb Bush established the Florida Office of Drug Control within the Governor's office, ensuring the state's efforts were coordinated and prioritized. Columba Bush subsequently became the spokesperson for substance abuse prevention in Florida, and today remains a national advocate for promoting substance abuse prevention, treatment and awareness.
Throughout his administration, Governor Bush remained committed to decreasing drug use, reducing recidivism, expanding the Florida drug court system, expanding drug abuse treatment and raising awareness of this tragic issue.

Reduced recidivism by tripling the number of drug courts: Florida has been a pioneer with respect to drug courts, specialized courts that are proven to reduce recidivism by addressing low-level drug crimes through monitored treatment and testing rather than incarceration. Governor Bush tripled the number of drug courts in Florida, deeply integrating them into Florida's criminal justice system.
Increased successful treatment of drug abusers including increases in:

The percentage of adults and children completing treatment by 20% and 16%, respectively
The percentage of adults that were employed after discharge from treatment by 27%
The percentage of adults and children that remained drug-free following completion of treatment by 31% and 21%, respectively

Supported major legislation curbing the drug market:

In 2001, a seaport law established security standards for Florida ports to help prevent drug smuggling, addressing the predominant means of importing illegal drugs into Florida.
In 2002, a prescription drug law made it a felony for a physician to fraudulently prescribe the widely abused drug carisoprodol (brand name Soma).
In 2003, a security bill required Florida to adopt a uniform access badge for all seaports, further suppressing smuggling.
In 2003, a law made the theft of anhydrous ammonia, an ingredient in the production of methamphetamine, a felony.
In 2004, a law required special permits for pharmacies operating over the internet.
In 2005, a law limited the amount of pseudoephedrine an individual can purchase and required pseudoephedrine products sold in stores to be placed behind the counter.

Conducted major multi-jurisdictional operations disrupting drug dealer networks:

Heat Rave (1999): targeted 57 nightclubs resulting in 1219 arrests, seizures of nearly 130,000 doses of club drugs, 15 kilos of cocaine and 500 lbs of marijuana
River Walk (2001-2003): severely disrupted drug trafficking organizations' efforts to use the Miami River to move drugs into South Florida
Sudden Storm (2002): multi-agency operation focused on highway safety and contraband interdiction along North Florida roadways, resulting in seizure of over 100 lbs of marijuana, 7.5 lbs of cocaine, 53 grams of crack cocaine, 10 marijuana plants and $127,751 in currency
