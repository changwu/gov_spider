SENT 10/4/91(House)(LaFalce (D) New York and 34 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2629, but will seek a Senate amendment to delete section 5(b). This section would raise constitutional concerns by establishing gender, ethnic, and racial restrictions for the appointment of two new members of the National Women's Business Council.
