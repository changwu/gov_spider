    Dear Roland:
The profound dedication to the welfare of all of our fellow men which you have demonstrated for so long as Chairman of the American National Red Cross has earned the gratitude as well as the deep respect of the American people.
The extent of your work in behalf of humanity is measureless. Past Presidents of the United States have been happy to express the Nation's confidence and appreciation by asking you to continue your splendid efforts through continued service in this demanding cause, and I am especially pleased to have the opportunity to reappoint you as Governor of the Corporation for a term of three years, from June 12, 1971. This appointment is made in accordance with provisions of Section 5 as amended, of the Act to incorporate the American Red Cross.
I also designate you to act as the principal officer of the corporation with such title and functions as may be prescribed in the by-laws of the corporation.
With best personal regards.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable E. Roland Harriman, Chairman, American National Red Cross, Washington, D.C. 20006]
