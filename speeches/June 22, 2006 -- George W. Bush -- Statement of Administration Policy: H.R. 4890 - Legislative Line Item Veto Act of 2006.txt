    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Ryan (R) WI and 110 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4890, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006. This legislation would give the President and Congress an important tool to reduce unjustified earmarks and wasteful spending items that are frequently incorporated into large, essential spending measures. This will improve accountability and transparency in the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. A critical feature of this legislation is the fast-track procedure that ensures an up-or-down vote without amendment on the President's package of proposed rescissions. Forty-three governors have a line item veto to reduce spending. The President needs similar authority to help control unjustified and wasteful spending in the Federal budget. The Administration hopes Congress will move quickly to pass this legislation and give the President and Congress a tool to restrain spending and protect the hard-earned money of American taxpayers.
