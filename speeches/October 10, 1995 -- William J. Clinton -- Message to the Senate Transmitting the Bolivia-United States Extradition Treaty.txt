    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia, signed at La Paz on June 27, 1995.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty, and copies of diplomatic notes dated June 27, 1995, which were exchanged at the time of signing of the Treaty. Those notes set forth the expectations of the two Governments regarding the types of assistance each Government would provide to the other in extradition proceedings, pursuant to Article XVI of the Treaty.
The Treaty establishes the conditions and procedures for extradition between the United States and Bolivia. It also provides a legal basis for temporarily surrendering prisoners to stand trial for crimes against the laws of the Requesting State.
The Treaty represents an important step in combatting narcotics trafficking and terrorism, by providing for the mandatory extradition of nationals of the Requested State in a broad range of serious criminal offenses.
The provisions in this Treaty are substantively similar to those of other extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
This Treaty will make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
