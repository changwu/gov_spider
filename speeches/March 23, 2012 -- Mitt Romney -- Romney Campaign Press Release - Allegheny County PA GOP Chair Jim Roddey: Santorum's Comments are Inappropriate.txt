    Allegheny County, Pennsylvania GOP Chair Jim Roddey made the following statement on Rick Santorum's suggestion that four more years of President Obama would be preferable to Mitt Romney:
"I am very disappointed to hear Senator Santorum say that he would prefer four more years of Barack Obama as president to electing Mitt Romney. His arrogant remarks are the most inappropriate comments made by any Republican candidate for president in recent history."
"Removing Obama from the White House is an urgent task if we are to turn our country around and undo the damage of the past three years. If Rick Santorum can't see that, if he's put his own political career and aspirations ahead of the good of the country, he's far from ready to be the Republican standard-bearer."
