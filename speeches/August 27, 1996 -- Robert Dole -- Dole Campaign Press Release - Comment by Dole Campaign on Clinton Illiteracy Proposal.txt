    Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"Bill Clinton is admitting that our schools cannot accomplish the most basic task of literacy. But, instead of pursuing fundamental reform -- by confronting the teachers' unions and embracing school choice -- Bill Clinton announces a new government program and a new pot of money for the unions. While well-intentioned, today's announcement -- which involves no changes within the classroom during school hours -- will do little to help the forty percent of fourth graders who in 1994 were found to scarcely possess reading skills. Note: Bill Clinton put forth no answers today on how to rid our kids' schools of violence and drugs -- temptations which lure them away from their books and a brighter destiny.
"By drawing education into the political discourse, Bill Clinton has drawn a clear distinction between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton. Bob Dole trusts the people. Bill Clinton trusts the NEA."
