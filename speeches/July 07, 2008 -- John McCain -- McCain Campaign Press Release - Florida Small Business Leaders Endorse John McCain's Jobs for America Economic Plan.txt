    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its Florida Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition co-chairs and steering committee. Small business owners throughout Florida endorsed John McCain's economic plan today, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's Jobs for America economic plan to grow the economy as president.
"As the former mayor of Tampa I know the important role that small businesses play in Florida's economic success," said former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco. "John McCain has always put America and American jobs first, and as president, his economic policies will support small business growth and the fundamental role these companies play in job creation."
Christine Vasconcelo, owner of Tampa's Bloomingdays Flowers Shop added, "John McCain is the change small business owners like me want in government. He recognizes small businesses drive our economy and he will make sure we have a pro-growth, low-tax economic environment for years to come."
