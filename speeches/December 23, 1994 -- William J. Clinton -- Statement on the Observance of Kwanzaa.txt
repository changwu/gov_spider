    Warm greetings to everyone who is observing the festival of Kwanzaa.
A vibrant and energizing celebration, Kwanzaa offers millions an opportunity to embrace the rich cultural traditions of the African heritage. The seven principles of Kwanzaa, unity, selfdetermination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith, serve as vital tools in building hope and opportunity in our communities and throughout our country, and I am pleased that so many of my fellow Americans are celebrating this year. All of you can be proud of your efforts to infuse the holiday season with diversity and new purpose.
Hillary joins me in wishing all of you a wonderful celebration and a Happy New Year.
