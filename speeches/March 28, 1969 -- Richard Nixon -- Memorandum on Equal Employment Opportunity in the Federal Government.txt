    Memorandum to Heads of Departments and Agencies
SUBJECT: Equal Employment Opportunity
The concept of nondiscrimination is inherent in the Civil Service Act of 1883, which calls for a Federal service based on merit and fitness alone. "Nondiscrimination" was broadened by President Eisenhower to "equal employment opportunity" with his issuance of Executive Order 10590 in 1955. In the years that followed, other Executive Orders designed to insure equal opportunity in the employment, development, advancement and treatment of employees of the Federal Government have been issued. This series of Presidential directives reflects continuing support for this program at the highest levels of Government.
I want to emphasize my own official and personal endorsement of a strong policy of equal employment opportunity within the Federal Government. I am determined that the Executive Branch of the Government lead the way as an equal opportunity employer.
Although under the leadership of the Civil Service Commission significant progress has been made towards the goal of equal employment opportunity, much remains to be done. Accordingly, I have directed the Chairman of the Commission to make a thorough review of all present efforts to achieve equal employment opportunity within the Federal Government and to report back to me on or before May 15, 1969, with recommendations for desirable policy and program changes in regard to those efforts.
Meanwhile, I want every reasonable effort made to insure that the Federal Government is an equal opportunity employer. I further urge you, if you have not already done so, to communicate your personal support for this program to all officials and employees of your agency.
RICHARD NIXON
