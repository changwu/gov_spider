    Senator Lamar Alexander today announced that he had voted for Mitt Romney during early-voting in Blount County, Tennessee.
"I'm truly honored to earn Lamar's vote," said Mitt Romney. "As a conservative leader in this country for many years, Lamar has been an outspoken advocate for smaller government, a balanced budget, and reforming our nation's broken education system. In the months ahead, I look forward to his counsel as we look to restore America's promise."
After early-voting today in Blount County, Tenn., Senator Alexander told media present, "I learned a long time ago that Tennesseans didn't elect me to tell them how to vote, but I voted for Governor Romney. We're electing a commander in chief who knows something about creating jobs, not a legislator in chief. For me, Governor Romney is the right choice. He's led a state, he's led a business, he's led the Olympics. All our candidates are good Republicans; I don't think they really disagree very much. They emphasize their differences, but the important difference is, Governor Romney has the executive experience this country needs, he's a good Republican, he can attract independents, and I believe he can defeat President Obama and lead our country in a better direction."
