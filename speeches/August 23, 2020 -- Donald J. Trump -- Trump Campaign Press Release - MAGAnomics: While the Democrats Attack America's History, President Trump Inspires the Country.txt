    Last week's Democratic National Convention offered an incredibly negative view of the United States and its history, engineered by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to invoke fear and pessimism. President Trump, on the other hand, plans to deliver a message devoted to America's greatness at this week's Republican National Convention, which will uplift viewers and inspire us all. President Trump has always been devoted to cultivating the best of America and making our country great again. Lara Trump, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor, and Tino Rivera, Founder of Staffing Solutions, discussed all this and more on today's 'MAGAnomics' broadcast hosted by Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor.

"While the Democratic National Convention demonstrated the radicalism of today's Democrat Party, President Trump is committed to celebrating America," said Lara Trump, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "Democrats don't showcase America, they criticize it, and that type of rhetoric is corrosive to Americans' patriotism and national pride."
"President Trump and the Republican Party are committed to highlighting Americaâ€™s Heartland in our convention while the Democrats focused on Hollywood elitists. This truly demonstrates the difference in objectives between the two parties," said Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "This President is already leading America's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, and only through this administration's optimistic leadership will we continue our rapid comeback."
"As a business owner from California, I know the threat of Democrat economic policies and how they can destroy prosperity," said Tino Rivera, Founder of Staffing Solutions. "Only President Trump can inspire confidence in the American people and rebuild our country."
