    THE SECOND volume of his report on Science and Public Policy has been submitted today by John R. Steelman, Chairman of the President's Scientific Research Board. This volume, "The Federal Research Program," for the first time gives the American people an accounting of the scientific work of their Government, which last year expended $625 million for thousands of scientific projects.
Mr. Steelman's report reveals that Government research in the physical and biological sciences covers a multitude of widely varied programs which cannot profitably be undertaken by private industry or agriculture. The scope of Federal research extends from the development of guided missiles, rockets, and other military devices to the control of soil erosion and the development of diseaseresistant plants. It affects the health and comfort and security of every citizen in countless ways.
The report consists of a description of the scientific research program of 16 Federal departments and agencies and includes an analysis of the money and manpower devoted to all major research. It should be studied carefully by everyone who wishes to understand the vast scope of our Federal program and the great benefits which result from it.
