    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Horn (R) CA and 14 others)
The Administration has no objection to H.R. 1271, as reported by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, because: (1) the written parental consent requirement has been revised to allow parental consent to be given by alternative means; and (2) necessary exceptions to the bill's requirements have been included.
