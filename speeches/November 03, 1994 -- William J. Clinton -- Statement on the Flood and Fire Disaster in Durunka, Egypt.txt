    I am deeply saddened to learn of the disaster in the Egyptian town of Durunka, as well as storm damage in other parts of the country. Mrs. Clinton and I join all Americans in extending our condolences to the families of the victims of this tragedy.
We are grateful for the warm welcome offered to us by the Egyptian people during our recent visit. I have instructed the U.S. Agency for International Development to offer cooperation and assistance to Egyptian relief operations. The people of Egypt can be sure that their American friends will stand by them in coping with the aftermath of this terrible event.
