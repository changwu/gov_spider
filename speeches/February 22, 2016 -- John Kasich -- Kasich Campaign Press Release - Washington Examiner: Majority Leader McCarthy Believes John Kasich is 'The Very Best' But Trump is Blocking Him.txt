    Congressman Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Monday that while he believes John Kasich would be one of the best choices for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has blocked his path.
"On paper he seems like the the very best," McCarthy said of Kasich on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Monday. "I've always had his philosophy, I think governors are a better training ground to be president. They work with money to balance the budget, they pick a cabinet and you have to make a decision at the end of the day. In the House and Senate you can play with politics all day but as a governor you have to make decisions and work on both sides."
Although McCarthy has yet to endorse anyone in the Republican primary, the congressman spoke highly of the Ohio governor, saying that he has "the type of character that I want in a person," but that the candidate's campaign has been overshadowed by Trump.
