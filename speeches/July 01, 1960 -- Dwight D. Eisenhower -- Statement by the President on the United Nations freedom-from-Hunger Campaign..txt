    ON THIS DAY, the food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has begun an international freedom-from-Hunger Campaign. The basic objectives of this campaign are to raise levels of food production and nutrition for the people of the world. These objectives have the earnest support of us all.
The world is confronted by two great problems in hunger: The needs of the present and the future. And the last is greater than the first. We must try to raise the level of nutrition for many millions who now subsist on an inadequate diet and we must find new sources of food for the rapidly expanding family of man.
To achieve this end, all countries will have to exert supreme efforts and inventiveness.
The United States took an active part in the formation and development of the food and Agriculture Organization. We continue to support it as an instrument for intergovernmental consultation, for the exchange of information, and to sponsor separate and collective actions by its member countries in raising levels of nutrition. We wish the Director General of FAO and his staff all success as they carry forward their Program of Work of which this Campaign is a special part. Through our food-for-Peace efforts we are advancing the objectives of the Campaign, and we are working with other countries in the common task of improving humanity's standard of living which gives substance to our hopes for the peace and freedom of all peoples.
