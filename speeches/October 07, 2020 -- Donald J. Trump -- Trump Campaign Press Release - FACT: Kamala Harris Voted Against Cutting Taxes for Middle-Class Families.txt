    Harris and Biden will raise taxes on American workers.
President Trump's historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act put American workers and families first. Thanks to his tax reform law, the average family of four saved $2,000 in taxes, and 91% of Americans in the middle income quintile received a tax cut.
Kamala Harris voted against the tax cuts in the Senate and has vowed to repeal them on "day one." Harris, along with Joe Biden, want to replace the law with massive tax hikes for virtually every American.


In fact, the Biden-Harris plan would raise taxes by more than $4 trillion, shrink our economy and kill 585,000 jobs. 

An estimated 80% of Americans would see their taxes rise in a Biden-Harris Administration. 

Biden and Harris pledged to bring back Obamacare's individual mandate tax, which disproportionately targets low and middle-income Americans. They would also increase the U.S. business tax rate from 21% to 28%, which will make it more expensive to do business in America than in China.
Five independent analyses have concluded that the Biden-Harris plan would raise taxes on middle-class Americans:


The Tax Policy Center concluded Biden's "proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups."

The Tax Foundation concluded Biden's plan would lead to higher taxes "across all income groups."

The American Enterprise Institute concluded that "households at every income level" would see higher taxes.

A Penn Wharton budget model analysis concluded that taxes would go up across all income levels.

The Committee For A Responsible Federal Budget concluded that taxes would go up across all income levels. 

Biden and Harris would make it harder for Americans to make ends meet.
