    Today, thanks to our economic strategy and the hard work of the American people, we reached another dramatic milestone in our unprecedented economic expansionâ€”the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9 percent, matching the lowest level in 30 years. Unemployment for African-Americans fell to the lowest level ever recorded, and for Hispanics it remains at historic lows. This is more good news for the American people and another reminder that those who advocate irresponsible tax plans that would jeopardize our fiscal progress are taking America down the wrong economic path.
