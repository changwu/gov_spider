    "I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity and not a land of oppression." – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott released his second TV ad today, titled "Land of Opportunity." The ad began airing today in Iowa and comes on the heels of Tim Scott announcing his candidacy for President of the United States on Monday in North Charleston. Tim just concluded trips to Iowa and New Hampshire this week, and will return to Iowa next Friday and Saturday, June 2 and 3.

TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: America is the greatest nation on God's green earth. Where you can go as high as your character, and your grit, and your talent will take you.
We are not defined by the color of our skin. We are defined by the content of our character, and if anyone tells you anything different, they're lying.
I will be the president who destroys the liberal lie that America is an evil country.
That's why I'm the candidate the far left fears the most.
I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control.
The truth of my life, disproves their lies.
I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity and not a land of oppression.
I'm Tim Scott, and I approve this message.
Tim entered the race for president with $22 million cash on hand, the most of any presidential candidate in American history. Following his presidential announcement, Tim raised an additional $2 million within one day.
