    To the Congress of the United States:
Enclosed is the "Second Annual Report of the National Heart and Lung Advisory Council," prepared in accordance with the requirement of Public Law 92-423, the "National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood Act of 1972."
The National Heart and Lung Advisory Council has again prepared a thoughtful Report that addresses a number of important research policy questions. With regard to the Council's Report, there are recommendations that are in accord with the Administration's views (e.g., for inter-Council collaboration) as well as recommendations that are at variance with Administration policy (e.g., on the Council's proposed budget).
The Report indicates that "the Council has tried to estimate as realistically as possible the funds which are required to implement the National Program" of the National Heart and Lung Institute. The Council recommended funding levels without considering budget constraints. Therefore, it is not surprising that the budget recommendations of the Council considerably exceed those of the President's 1976 Budget, which must take fiscal constraints and competing national needs into consideration. It should be noted that the budget for the National Heart and Lung Institute has increased greatly in recent years: from $195 million in 1971 to $286 million in 1974, to $293 million proposed for 1976.
The Administration acknowledges the accomplishments of the National Program as described in the Council's Report, and continues to view the heart and lung program as an area of high priority. The Report of the Council merits serious consideration and is being carefully studied and evaluated. I am forwarding the Report to the Congress so that it is available for deliberations.
