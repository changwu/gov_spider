    Whereas there have arrived periodically at Pacific Coast ports since November 1928, a total of 17 trans-pacific passenger-carrying vessels with epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis infection existing on board among Oriental steerage passengers;
And Whereas the continued arrival of vessels having epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis infection on board has overtaxed the combined available quarantine facilities of federal and local health authorities and that notwithstanding the quarantine defense, there exists danger of introducing this disease into the United States;
Therefore in order to prevent the further introduction of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis from foreign ports into the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 7 of the Act of Congress approved February 15, 1893, entitled "An Act granting additional quarantine powers and imposing additional duties upon the Marine Hospital Service", it is ordered that no persons may be introduced directly or indirectly by transshipment or otherwise into the United States or any of its possessions or dependencies from any port in China (including Hong Kong) or the Philippine Islands for such period of time as may be deemed necessary, except under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
This order shall take effect from and after this date.
