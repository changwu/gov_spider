    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(Senate)(Kassebaum (R-KS), Kennedy (D-MA) and 55 others)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 102S, as reported by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and amended by the managers of the bill, Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy. The bill represents an important step toward strengthening the health security of the American people which this Administration has made a priority since 1993. Consistent with past Administration policy, we oppose any amendments that could weaken the legislation or undermine potential enactment of the Kassebaum/Kennedy legislation.
