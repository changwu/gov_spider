McLean, VA - Senator Fred Thompson today released the following statement regarding World Bank funding in Iran:
"The UN has proven unable to take serious action to stop Iran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Indeed, Iran continues to violate its treaty obligations and thumb its nose at the world body. Yet today, the UN gave the leader of the world's premier state sponsor of terror a platform to establish his credibility and espouse additional vitriol. All of this despite the fact that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of another UN member state--Israel--and threatens the stability of the Gulf region.
"But there are other international organizations with equally troubling ties to this oppressive regime. The World Bank, for example, has provided billions of dollars for projects in Iran over the years despite its resource wealth. The U.S. and other democratic members of the G-8 are the principal contributors.
"I'm all for the World Bank financing projects that are intended to reduce poverty and help others abroad. But American taxpayers' money shouldn't be used so that Tehran can divert its own money into a nuclear weapons program, long-range missile development, terrorist operations throughout the region, and most heinously, providing arms and support to those who are killing American soldiers in Iraq.
"Time is long overdue for the U.S. and its G-8 partners to end all World Bank funding to Iran until it abides by UN directives, lives up to its international obligations, and stops all of its illicit activities in the region."
