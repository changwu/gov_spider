    Paragraph 3, Subdivision IX, Schedule A, positions excepted from examination under the civil service rules, is hereby amended to read as follows:
Guards, scalers, field assistants for reconnaissance parties, foremen engaged upon road or trail construction, and telephone operators, employed temporarily during the season of danger from fires or when special work requires additions to the regular forest force. They shall serve only so long as absolutely required and in no case beyond the usual field season. So far as the Commission may deem practicable, such appointments shall be made from the registers of eligibles.
The amendment consists of the insertion of the word "scalers" and is designed to facilitate administrative action on the ground in connection with Forest Service timber sale operations.
