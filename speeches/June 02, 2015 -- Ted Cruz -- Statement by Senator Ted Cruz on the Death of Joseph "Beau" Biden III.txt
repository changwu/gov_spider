    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to the news Vice President Joe Biden's son, Joseph "Beau" Biden III, has passed away:
"Yesterday Joseph 'Beau' Biden III, a long-time public servant, Iraq War veteran, and the son of Vice President Joe Biden, passed away after a hard-fought battle with brain cancer. Heidi and I were saddened by the news of the loss of Beau, a dedicated husband and father, and a man that so many admired. He tirelessly worked to serve his country.
"As the parents of two precious little girls, Heidi and I can only imagine the grief of losing a child — something no parent should have to do. We would like to extend our deepest sympathies and our prayers to Joe and Jill, the entire Biden family, and all those who knew and loved Beau."
