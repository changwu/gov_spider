    Today I have signed into law S. 1891, an Act that amends the Public Health Service and Controlled Substances Acts.
The Act has two provisions. Section 1 would broaden the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive the recovery of Federal funds used in the remodeling, construction, and expansion of community mental health centers. Section 2 of S. 1891 would permit the Attorney General to transfer to States real property that has been forfeited under the Controlled Substances Act. States would have to use the property for recreational or historic purposes or for the preservation of natural conditions.
It is my intent that transfers of property under section 2 will be limited to situations in which the transfer will not breach the obligations of the United States to any State or local law enforcement agencies entitled by law to a share of the proceeds from the sale of such property. Moreover, I intend that State and local agencies receiving transfers pursuant to section 2 will assume responsibility for the payment of claims by innocent lienholders and for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the United States in the seizure, management, or forfeiture of the property.
