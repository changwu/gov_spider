    I commend the House for taking an important step to secure our energy future and to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. The House energy legislation is largely consistent with the key objectives of my comprehensive national energy policy: increasing conservation and efficiency, expanding domestic production in environmentally responsible ways, diversifying our energy supply with more renewables and clean fuels, and modernizing our energy infrastructure. For more than a decade, our Nation has not had a sensible, balanced, and comprehensive energy strategy. An energy bill will help us make better use of the energy supplies we have and will make our supply of energy more affordable and more secure for the future. I look forward to swift Senate action so that I can sign a bill into law by August.
