"I have very strong confidence that if we get the nomination, we will win {the general election}."
Citing the deep history of polls at this stage being unable to predict election outcomes, Webb said, "When the hysteria dies down from all the verbal bombs that are being thrown back and forth, people are going to want to see that they will be able to elect a leader who has the track record and the vision to bring the country forward. That's what we're offering."
