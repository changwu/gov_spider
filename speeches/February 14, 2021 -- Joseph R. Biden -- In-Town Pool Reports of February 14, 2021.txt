White House In-Town Pool Report #1 â€“ POTUS at Camp David 
Good morning all. It's a grey and chilly Valentine's Day at the White House, where your in-town print pooler is milling about and dodging falling icicles following a COVID test. The North Lawn fountain is running, which seems bold given the weather (34 degrees at the moment).
President Biden and the first lady are still at Camp David, where they have been since Friday evening. A White House official tells your pooler that the president this morning signed an executive order establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, which will establish policies to "enlist, equip, enable, empower, and expand" the work of community-serving organizations, per the order's text.
POTUS has no public events, and will not be returning to the White House today.
