    Melania joins me in sending our warmest greetings on Eid al-Fitr. At the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate the day of Eid through prayer and reflection. This sacred day provides Muslims, both in the United States and around the world, an opportunity to renew their commitment to help those less fortunate, to strengthen their faith in God, and to engage in worship and fellowship with others.
We hope that this holiday brings joy and peace to all those celebrating, and we pray that communities worldwide feel God's abundant blessings of love, forgiveness, and good will. Eid Mubarak.
