    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit to Congress the Five-Year Plan for the National Climate Program as prepared by the Department of Commerce. This Five-Year Plan, to establish goals and priorities and to clarify various agencies' roles, is in accordance with section 5 of the National Climate Program Act of 1978.
The plan is divided in three major parts: introducing and developing of the Five-Year Plan, the projects and activities to be emphasized over the five years, and the administration of the program and future directives.
The National Climate Program is intended to aid our Nation in understanding the climate processes and to make such information widely available.
