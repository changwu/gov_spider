    Staples Founder Tom Stemberg made the following statement on President Obama's claim that his economic policies have "worked":
"President Obama may say that his economic policies have 'worked,' but they've only 'worked' for the donors and political allies whom he's rewarded with billions of dollars in stimulus funding and taxpayer-backed grants and loans for their companies."
"The 23 million Americans still struggling for work, on the other hand, continue to suffer under President Obama's job-killing policies. These hard-working men and women deserve a president who puts his faith in them and who will put job creation first: Mitt Romney."
