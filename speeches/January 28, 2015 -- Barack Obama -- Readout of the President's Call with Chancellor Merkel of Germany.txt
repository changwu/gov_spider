    The President spoke today with Chancellor Merkel of Germany regarding developments in Ukraine. The two leaders expressed concern about the significant increase in violence in eastern Ukraine and Russia's materiel support for the separatists and its failure to fulfill its commitment under the Minsk Agreement, and they agreed on the need to hold Russia accountable for its actions. They also agreed on the importance of finalizing a robust package of financial support for Ukraine to enable it to stabilize its economy as it continues to implement reforms that will lay the groundwork for a return to growth and prosperity.
