    President Trump. Thank you very much. We've all had a very successful day and a very interesting day. And it's great to be with my friend, the President of Mexico. And we're negotiating NAFTA and some other things with Mexico, and we'll see how it all turns out. But I think we've made very good progress.
So it's great to be with you. Thank you.
President Pe√±a Nieto. Thank you very much. I want to thank you for opening this space that I had with President Donald Trump. And I'm sure this is going to help us continue a very flowing dialogue, sir, that will allow us, of course, for the negotiation of NAFTA; to continue working in terms of cooperation, especially for security, for the security of both nations, especially in our borders; and of course, also working in migration issues, which is a task that both of our nations are occupied, and our administrations are occupied with this issue as well. And of course, something that both of our administrations have taken upon ourselves to really admit, that is, in a coresponsible manner, to look into organized crime issues.
Thank you so much for this place of opportunity. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much.
