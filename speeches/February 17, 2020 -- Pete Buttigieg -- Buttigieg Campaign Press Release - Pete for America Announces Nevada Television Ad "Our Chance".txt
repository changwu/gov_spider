    Las Vegas, NV — Today, Pete for America released "Our Chance," a new television ad running statewide in Nevada. "Our Chance" highlights how Pete Buttigieg will turn the page on the division and dysfunction of Washington and pave a new way forward. The ad reminds Nevadans that in the most consequential election of our lifetimes, it is too risky to play it safe. Pete Buttigieg is the candidate who will unite Americans around our shared values and put forth a bold vision for the future.
Watch "Our Chance" 

Since the summer, Pete for America has been building a strong organization and infrastructure that not only looks like Nevada, but also reaches every corner and every community across the state. Pete for America has one of the biggest presences in the Battle Born State, with 12 offices and over 100 staff on the ground — including nearly 80 who are exclusively focused on organizing. 
Pete has undeniable momentum heading into the Nevada caucuses. This past weekend, Pete drew a crowd of over 1,100 Nevadans to Rancho High School in North Las Vegas, and over 1,200 people came to see Pete in Sparks. Today, Pete will hold town halls in Reno, Carson City and Elko.

We have exactly one shot to defeat Donald Trump. 
And we're not going to do it by overreaching. ... We're not going to do it by division.
We're seeing Democrats hungry to win, Independent voters who had been turned off by our politics, Republicans tired of trying to look their kids in the eye and explain this presidency, all standing together.
If you are ready to build an American life defined by belonging, this is our chance.
I'm Pete Buttigieg, and I approve this message.
