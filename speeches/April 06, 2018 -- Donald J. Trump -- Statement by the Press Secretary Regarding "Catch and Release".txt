    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to take important steps to end "catch and release," the dangerous practice whereby aliens who have violated our Nation's immigration laws are released into the United States shortly after their apprehension. The safety and security of the American people is the President's highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected.
At the same time, the President continues to call on congressional Democrats to cease their staunch opposition to border security and to stop blocking measures that are vital to the safety and security of the United States.
