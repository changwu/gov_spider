    The President. What a great voice. Thank you very much. Great job. I want to thank everybody. This is the 139th Easter Egg Roll. Think of it—139. It began, long time ago—1878. And we will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before. We're right on track. You see what's happening, and we are right on track. So thank you, everybody, for being here.
We're going to do cards for soldiers a little bit, Melania and Barron and myself. We're going downstairs, we're going to sign some cards to our great troops—they're cards for troops—and we look forward to that. And then, we're going to come out and join you and enjoy your company for a roll, a great Easter Egg Roll. And I don't know if we're going to be successful, but I know a lot of people down there are going to be successful. I've seen those kids, and they're highly, highly competitive. [Laughter] That I can tell you.
I just want to thank First Lady Melania Trump. She's really worked hard on this. She has been working on this for a long time to make it perfect, and we wanted to keep it just right. So I want to just ask her to speak. But before she speaks, I want to congratulate her on this wonderful, wonderful day. We're going to have a lot of people—a lot of people—and they're going to have a great time.
So, Melania, thank you very much. And, Barron, thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much.
