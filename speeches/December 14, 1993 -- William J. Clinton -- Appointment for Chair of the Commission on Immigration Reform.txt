    The President today appointed former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan to chair the Commission on Immigration Reform. The nine-member Commission was created by Congress in 1990 to evaluate the impact of the recent changes in immigration policy and to recommend further changes that might be necessary by September 30, 1994, and again by September 30, 1997.
"I have chosen Barbara Jordan, one of the most well respected people in America, to chair this Commission because immigration is one of the most important and complex issues facing our country today," said the President. "I am confident that Congresswoman Jordan will use her prodigious talents to thoughtfully address the challenges posed by immigration reform, balance the variety of competing interests, and recommend policies that will be in our country's best interests."
