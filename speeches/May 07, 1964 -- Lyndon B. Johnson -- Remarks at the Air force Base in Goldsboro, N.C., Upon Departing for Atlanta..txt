    Ladies and gentlemen:
I am sorry that we are so late. I appreciate so very much your coming out here and giving us this great welcome. I don't know when I have ever spent a day that I have enjoyed more than the day that I have spent in the great State of North Carolina, with the fine people who have met us at every place that we have stopped.
I am sorry that we are running about 2 hours late. I had a dinner engagement in Atlanta, Ga., at 8:40, so we are going to have to move along.
But I do want you to know that I have enjoyed being with you. I think we have made some progress on our problem. I have had a long and fruitful, encouraging talk with your great Governor, Terry Sanford, with your able Senator, Sam Ervin, and Senator Jordan, with the Members of your congressional delegation, and I look forward to having them work with me and with members of my Cabinet in bringing about a program that will give the greatest good to the greatest number of all of our people.
I think that you are wonderful folks; you have been extremely gracious to me and my party, and my family. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I wish I had the time, because I do have the strength--I get strength from looking at you and from seeing you, and from shaking your hand--but I am late and I must run away.
Thank you so much, and I hope to see you in North Carolina before November.
