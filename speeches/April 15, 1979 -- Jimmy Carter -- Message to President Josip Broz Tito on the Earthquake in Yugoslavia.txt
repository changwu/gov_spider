    Dear Mr. President:
I was distressed to learn of the violent earthquake which struck the southern coast of Yugoslavia earlier today. Please accept my deepest sympathy and that of my family in the face of this tragic event. I have asked Ambassador Eagleburger to convey to Mr. Veljko Milativic, President of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, and through him to the families of the victims, my personal condolences and those of the American people.
The United States stands ready to assist in efforts to relieve the suffering. I have instructed Ambassador Eagleburger to remain in close touch with the appropriate authorities to determine how we may best be of assistance.
Again, Mr. President, please accept my deepest sympathy and condolences.
JIMMY CARTER
