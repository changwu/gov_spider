    Saturday marks the fourth anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. As we share our grief with the Lebanese people over the loss of Prime Minister Hariri, we also share our conviction that his sacrifice will not be in vain. The United States fully supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, whose work will begin in a few weeks to bring those responsible for this horrific crime and those that followed to justice.
As Lebanon prepares for Parliamentary elections, the United States will continue to support Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, the legitimate institutions of the Lebanese state, and the Lebanese people. The United States remains committed to the full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559. We also will continue to support the voices of peace and moderation in Lebanon and hope that Lebanon continues down the path of national reconciliation, peace, and prosperity that its citizens so strongly deserve.
