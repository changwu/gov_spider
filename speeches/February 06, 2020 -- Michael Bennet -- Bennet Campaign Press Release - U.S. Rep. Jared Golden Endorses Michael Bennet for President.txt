    MANCHESTER — U.S. Representative Jared Golden today announced his endorsement of Michael Bennet for President of the United States.
Golden represents Maine's Second District—an area that voted for Barack Obama and then Donald Trump. As the only candidate to win twice in a swing state, Bennet's experience and Real Deal agenda will help Democrats up and down the ballot, galvanizing not only the Democratic base, but also helping win back some of the nine million Obama-Trump voters across the country.
Bennet was the first presidential candidate to come out in support of ranked choice voting—an innovative approach to reduce partisanship and increase choices for voters—the method by which Golden won his office in 2018.
"Talking about the Democratic presidential nomination last week, one voter described Senator Michael Bennet as 'calm, thoughtful, honest and humble. In other words, he doesn't stand a chance.' That's the kind of cynicism too many of us have come to expect of our politics these days. These qualities should be exactly the things we look for in a leader," Golden said in a statement to Bennet supporters.
"While many candidates blame the current president for our broken politics, Michael Bennet honestly identifies the challenges facing our democracy as decades old and going nowhere unless we commit to revitalize the good in our democracy and reform the worst.
"Bennet will fight to end gerrymandering so that voters can choose their representative, rather than representatives choosing their voters. He is committed to fighting corruption and putting an end to an era dominated by big money politics. And most importantly, after years of divisive leadership from Washington, Michael Bennet is committed to leading this country by example toward a more unified and thoughtful future.
"For these reasons and more, I believe Michael Bennet is the leader we need in the White House."
