PAUL RYAN: "We can't afford to wait four more years. We can wait three more days. Mitt Romney and I are making this commitment because this is a compact; it's a contract; it's a covenant between us and the people whose votes we seek. We will not duck these tough issues. We're not going to run away from our country's economic and fiscal problems. We're going to run at these problems. We're not going to kick the can down the road. We're serious about this. And we're not going to spend the next four years blaming other people. We're going to take responsibility and clean up this mess in Washington."
