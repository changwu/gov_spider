    Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan
The President. I just wanted to say that I have heard today the sad news that Prime Minister Obuchi has been hospitalized with a stroke. He has been a good friend to me personally, a good friend of the United States. And he has been a tireless worker to restore the Japanese economy and to bring Asia back from its financial crisis.
And I just wanted to say that the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with him, his family, and the people of Japan. We hope for a speedy recovery. And in the meanwhile, we will work with Acting Prime Minister Aoki to maintain the strong relationship we enjoy.
But I think Prime Minister Obuchi is a very good man, and I—it's sad news for all of us here in America, but we're pulling for his recovery, and we will—we will keep our prayers there.
Thank you very much.
Q. What are you hearing about—about how he is?
The President. Nothing. I have tried to get more information, but all I know is that he's hospitalized, and the condition was serious enough to appoint an acting Prime Minister. That may or may not mean anything, you know. My guess is that they'll have to wait a while and assess——

Q. Mr. President, did you hear—did you hear Mr. Lazio's comments today indicating he might get into the New York Senate race?
The President. No, I have no knowledge of that. Thanks.
