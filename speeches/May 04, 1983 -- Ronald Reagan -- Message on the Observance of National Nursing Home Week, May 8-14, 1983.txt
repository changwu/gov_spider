    During National Nursing Home Week, nursing homes throughout America will honor their elderly residents as a very special link to our heritage.
As the 1983 theme declares, "Memories Are Made To Be Shared." From our older citizens we learn about the roots of our families and communities. We share valued memories, and through sharing our seniors refresh their lives and we gain precious new understanding and insights about ours.
While nursing home staffs provide care with skill and kindness, visits from family, friends, and volunteers add immeasurably to the lives of elderly residents.
In observing this week, I urge each of you to reach out to share time and compassion with the men and women who live in nursing homes in your communities. We all will be richer for the effort we make.
