    I appreciate the outstanding work Regina Montoya has done as the Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
When I asked Regina to join my administration, I knew she was sacrificing a great deal to leave a successful legal career and her family in Dallas. When she informed me she was contemplating returning to Dallas because of the difficulty the commute has placed on her family, I was supportive of her decision to reunite her family.
I applaud her decision and thank her for the hard work and dedicated service she gave her country and wish her happiness and success in the future. And I look forward to calling on her for her insight in the future.
I am also very pleased that Marcia Hale has agreed to take on this new responsibility. Marcia has been a strong team player, a dedicated worker, and a valued adviser in her capacity as Director of Scheduling and Advance. Her background in State government and experience in consensus-building and solving local issues will make her a forceful advocate for local and State interests. I look forward to Marcia's trusted counsel, analysis, and judgment in this new and exciting endeavor.
