    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Italian Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Fraud or Fiscal Evasion, signed at Washington on August 25, 1999, together with a Protocol. Also transmitted are an exchange of notes with a Memorandum of Understanding and the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention.
This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and other developed nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to residents that are engaged in treaty-shopping or certain abusive transactions.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 21, 1999.
