    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Nevada and ordered federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding during the period of September 7-9, 2014.
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding on the Moapa Band of Paiutes Reservation.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures in all areas within the state.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Mark H. Landry as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
