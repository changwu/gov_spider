    To the Congress of the United States:
I have reviewed the activities of United States Government departments and agencies during the calendar year 1983 related to preventing nuclear proliferation, and I am pleased to submit my annual report on this subject pursuant to Section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-242).
The report concludes that U.S.. non-proliferation initiatives during 1983 continued to contribute positively to the important goal of preventing the further spread of nuclear explosives.
As I have stated on a number of occasions, nuclear proliferation would pose a severe threat to international peace, regional and global stability, and the security interests of the United States and other countries. I continue to regard the prevention of the spread of nuclear explosives as a fundamental national security and foreign policy objective, and I remain firmly committed to the pursuit of policies designed to advance our non-proliferation goals.
