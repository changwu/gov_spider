Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced 60 new members of the Romney for President National Hispanic Steering Committee. Since its formal launch in June, the Committee has been advising Governor Romney and his campaign on matters of importance to the Hispanic community.
"As I prepare to participate in tonight's historic Univision Presidential Forum at the University of Miami, I am pleased to welcome these distinguished leaders to my campaign and thank them for their support. Tonight and over the coming months, we will continue communicating my vision for a strong economy, strong military and strong families," said Governor Romney.
As the only Republican campaign to make significant efforts to engage the Hispanic community, Governor Romney has drawn praise from independent observers. Among many efforts, Governor Romney has actively spoken out about Latin America. In June, he became the first Republican presidential candidate to announce a National Hispanic Steering Committee. His campaign has held Hispanic roundtables across the nation and in July he was the only Republican presidential candidate to attend the Republican National Hispanic Assembly's (RNHA) annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Governor Romney's Spanish-language website was launched the week his campaign began and is still the only one of its kind in the Republican field. The campaign is currently running its third Spanish-language ad highlighting his record of success. Craig and Ann Romney have also campaigned on the Governor's behalf in the Hispanic community.
As Chair of the National Hispanic Steering Committee, Al Cardenas said, "As most of the Republican presidential candidates look to today's Univision Presidential Forum at the University of Miami, a great deal of attention will deservingly be focused on the impact of the Hispanic vote in determining our next Republican nominee and President. I am very encouraged by the continued support we are receiving from Hispanic leaders across our country who believe Mitt Romney is the best candidate to continue the Reagan tradition of strengthening our economy, our military and our families."
