    The President commends the Senate's vote for fiscal restraint by its refusal to waive the budget act for the housing bill. This measure is clearly at odds with efforts to reduce the deficit.
At this juncture in the budget negotiations, it is encouraging to see 40 Members of the Senate willing to vote against increasing the deficit, despite pressures from special interests. Should this legislation reach the President's desk in its current form, it will be vetoed because of the impact its provisions will have on deficit spending for years to come.
