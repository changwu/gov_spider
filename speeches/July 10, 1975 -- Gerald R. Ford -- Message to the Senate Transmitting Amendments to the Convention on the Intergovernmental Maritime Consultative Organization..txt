    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate amendments to articles 10, 16, 17, 18, 20, 28, 31 and 32 of the Convention on the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO), which were adopted on October 17, 1974, by the Assembly of IMCO at its fifth extraordinary session held at London from October 16 to 18, 1974.
These amendments enlarge the membership of the IMCO Council from eighteen to twenty-four, insure equitable geographic representation of member States on the Council, and open participation on the Maritime Safety Committee to all members of the Organization.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the amendments.
Support for these amendments will contribute to the United States' demonstrated interest in facilitating cooperation among maritime nations. To that end, I urge that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to these amendments and give its advice and consent to their acceptance.
