    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Owens (D) Utah and six others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2372 because it would establish a broad, unjustified, and expensive entitlement program. This bill does not require that causation be demonstrated between exposure to radiation and any subsequently developed malady. Nor does it require that any legal theory of liability on the part of the United States be satisfied through evidentiary proof. Available scientific evidence does not support a presumption that the diseases compensable under the bill resulted from the Federal Government's Atmospheric Atomic Testing Program or its purchase of uranium.
