    For more than 20 years, Representative Mark Takai has proudly served the people of Hawaii. As a long-time Lieutenant Colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard, as a champion for our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans, and as someone who stands up for our working families, he's always been a fighter. That's the approach he'll take to his battle with cancer, too. Michelle and I thank Mark for his leadership and service, but also for his courage and tireless advocacy for cancer research, research that has given hope to others who fight this disease every day. And we want Mark to know that he and his family have our continued support and warmest wishes on their journey ahead.
