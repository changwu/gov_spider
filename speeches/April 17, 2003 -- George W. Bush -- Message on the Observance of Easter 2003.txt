    I send greetings to those observing Easter. Easter is the most important event of the Christian faith, when people around the world join together with family and friends to celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the hope of life to come.
For Christians, the life and death of Jesus are the ultimate expressions of love, and the supreme demonstrations of God's mercy, faithfulness, and redemption. Since Christ's miraculous Resurrection on Easter, more than 2,000 years ago, Christians have expressed joy and gratitude for this wondrous sacrifice and for God's promise of freedom for the oppressed, healing for the brokenhearted, and salvation.
Though this year's observance comes at a time when our world faces many challenges, the message of Easter remains unchangedâ€”though sorrow may last through the night, joy comes in the morning. This holiday comforts us, as we remember that suffering will pass and goodness will prevail.
This Easter season, join me in praying for peace, wisdom, and resolve. During this holy time, may Christ's example of love and sacrifice compel us towards justice and compassion, and renew us with an assurance of hope and everlasting joy.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy Easter.
