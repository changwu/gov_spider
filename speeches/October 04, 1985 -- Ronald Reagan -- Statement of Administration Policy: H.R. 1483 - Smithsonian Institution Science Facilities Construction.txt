    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Mineta (D) California and 8 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1483 because the authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1987 is premature and consideration of such an authorization should be postponed until after the President's 1987 Budget is submitted to Congress.
