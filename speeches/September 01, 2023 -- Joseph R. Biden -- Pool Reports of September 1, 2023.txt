In-Town Pool Report #1
Good morning. I will be your pooler on this (rare) beautiful Washington summer day.
The only thing on the schedule so far is the POTUS jobs-day remarks in the Rose Garden, scheduled for 11:15 a.m. That event is open press, but I will endeavor to give a two-minute warning when we get one.
Enjoy the weather.
