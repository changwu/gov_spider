    You are about to embark on a mission of great importance to our Nation and the free world. The conditions under which you carry out your vital assignment are, I know, demanding and potentially dangerous. You are tasked to be once again what Marines have been for more than 200 years—peacemakers.
Your role in the multi-national force—along with that of your French and Italian counterparts—is crucial to achieving the peace that is so desperately needed in this long-tortured city.
I expect that you will perform with the traditional esprit and discipline for which the Marine Corps is renowned. Godspeed.
