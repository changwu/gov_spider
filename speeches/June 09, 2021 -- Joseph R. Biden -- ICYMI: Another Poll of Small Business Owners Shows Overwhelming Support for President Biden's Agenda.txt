    Today, a survey by Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Small Businesses of small businesses was released. Among its findings is the fact that 61% of small business owners support the American Jobs Plan and 60% support the American Families Plan. This comes the day after a poll was released by Small Business Majority which showed small business overwhelmingly support infrastructure investments.
The bottom line? President Biden's American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan enjoy broad support among the American people and, as we can see in two recent polls, American small businesses.
