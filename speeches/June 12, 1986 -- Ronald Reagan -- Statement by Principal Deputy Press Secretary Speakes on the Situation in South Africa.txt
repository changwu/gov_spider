    We have noted the action by the South African Government this morning. We call on both sides again to use restraint, to avoid violence, to enter into a dialog, to work out a negotiated settlement to the problems that exist in South Africa. The State Department early today was in contact with the Embassy. The Embassy will be in contact with the South African Government.
