Dear Mr. President:
The American people join me in expressing to you and the entire Uruguayan nation our sympathetic concern over the tragic losses resulting from the calamitous floods in your country. We hope that the relief operations, in which we have been glad to participate, have already helped to alleviate the distress caused by this disaster and that the unfortunate people affected by the floods will soon be able to reestablish their homes and regain their livelihood.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
His Excellency Doctor Martin R. Echegoyen
President, National Council of Government
Oriental Republic of Uruguay
Montevideo
