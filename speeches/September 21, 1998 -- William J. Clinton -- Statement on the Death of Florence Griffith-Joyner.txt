    Hillary and I are shocked and saddened by the sudden death of Florence Griffith-Joyner. America—and the world—has lost one of our greatest Olympians. Ten years ago, in a blazing 10.49 seconds, Flo-Jo sprinted to Olympic gold and earned the right to be called the "World's Fastest Woman." We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, and captivated by her style. Though she rose to the pinnacle of the world of sports, she never forgot where she came from, devoting time and resources to helping children—especially those growing up in our most disadvantaged neighborhoods— make the most of their own talents. I was very proud to have her serve as cochair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Our thoughts and prayers go to her husband, Al, her daughter, Mary, and her entire family.
