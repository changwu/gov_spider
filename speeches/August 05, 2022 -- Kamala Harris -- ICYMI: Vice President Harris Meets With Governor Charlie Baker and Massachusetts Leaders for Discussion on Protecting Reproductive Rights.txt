Harris hailed Massachusetts as a "model" for the nation on the issue as Governor Charlie Baker, a pro-abortion rights Republican who later echoed her talking points, sat to her left.
"Governor, I appreciate the role, the national leadership that you have provided on this issue," Harris said to Baker as a phalanx of Democratic lawmakers and other officials flanked her at the IBEW Local 103 headquarters in Dorchester.

Vice President Kamala Harris highlighted Massachusetts as a leader in the national fight to protect abortion rights during a round table discussion in Boston Thursday as part of a visit to the Bay State.
During the Vice President's meeting, Harris and several other leaders including Gov. Charlie Bake, U.S. Department of Defense Undersecretary Gil Cisneros and Representative Ayanna Pressley, discussed the significance of a women's right to make decisions about her reproductive health after the Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.
"We are here today because we share a fundamental belief that we trust the women of America to make decisions about what is in their best interest," Harris said Thursday. "And we believe it is they who should make that decision and not their government. It is that simple."
