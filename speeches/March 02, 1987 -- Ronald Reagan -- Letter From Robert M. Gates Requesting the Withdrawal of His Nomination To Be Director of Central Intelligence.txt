    Dear Mr. President:
It is apparent that there is strong sentiment in the Senate to await completion, at minimum, of the work of the Senate Select Committee on Iran before acting on my nomination. I believe a prolonged period of uncertainty would be harmful to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Intelligence Community and potentially to our national security. Accordingly, I respectfully request that you withdraw my nomination to be Director of Central Intelligence. I am deeply honored that you chose me for this high position and I pledge my full support and assistance to whomever you select, and the Senate confirms, as the next Director.
Sincerely,
ROBERT M. GATES
