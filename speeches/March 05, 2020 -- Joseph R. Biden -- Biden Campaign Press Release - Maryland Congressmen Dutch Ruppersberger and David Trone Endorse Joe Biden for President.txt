    Today, Maryland Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger and David Trone endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"As a former member of the Gang of Eight who has spent my entire time in Congress focusing on our national security, I know what's at stake when we alienate our allies and provoke our enemies. No candidate is better equipped to protect our country from the threats of today and tomorrow than Joe Biden, a skilled diplomat who understands that we are stronger together and that military force is just one tool in the toolbox. When it comes to the safety of our troops on the front lines and the citizens back home, I trust Joe Biden," said Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger.
Vice President Joe Biden's experience and values mean he will hit the ground running when it comes to tackling our nation's opioid crisis, expanding access to mental health care, and reforming our broken criminal justice system. The plan Joe released today will improve our lives and create a better future for our children. The people of Maryland know Joe Biden, but more importantly, Joe Biden knows Maryland, and he will advocate for Marylanders every step of the way. I trust Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump and end the opioid epidemic," said Congressman David Trone.
Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 60 U.S. Representatives and seven U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
