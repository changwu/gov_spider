    Five years ago today, the Family and Medical Leave Act went into effect, giving tens of millions of Americans the peace of mind that they would never have to choose between the jobs they need and the families they love. I am very proud that the Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first piece of legislation I signed into law.
Millions of Americans have benefited from this historic legislation by taking time off—without fear of losing their jobs—to care for a newborn or adopted child, to attend to their own serious health needs, or to care for a seriously ill parent, child, or spouse. In addition, a report issued today by the Department of Labor shows the relative ease with which the law has been implemented; the overwhelming majority of employers have found the FMLA easy to administer, and 9 out of 10 complaints have been successfully resolved, often with a simple phone call.
I have always believed that we can help our workers fulfill their family responsibilities and strengthen the economy and America's businesses. For 5 years, the Family and Medical Leave Act has helped us to fulfill both of those critical goals.
