How do you know Hillary will fight for affordable health care for every American as president??
Because that's what she's done her entire career:

The year Hillary became chair of the Arkansas Rural Health Advisory Committee, a 44-member team working to expand health care access to rural areas of the state


Children currently covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which Hillary worked with leaders on both sides of the aisle to create


World Trade Center responders and survivors who have received medical care over the past year under the James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which Hillary championed as senator


Funding Hillary helped secure so that 9/11 responders suffering lasting health effects from their time at Ground Zero could receive the monitoring and care they need


National Guard, Reservists, and families enrolled in the TRICARE Reserve Select military health benefits program even when they're not deployedâ€”benefits Hillary worked across the aisle as a senator to create
