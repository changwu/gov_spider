    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released a new television ad, entitled "A Better Way," focusing on John McCain's commitment to addressing the challenge of global climate change.
This week, John McCain travels to the Pacific Northwest to deliver remarks on climate change, setting the stage for a discussion on conservation and stewardship of our natural resources. Today in Portland, John McCain will deliver a major speech outlining his plans to combat the threat of global climate change and re-establish America's environmental leadership in the world. He will propose a domestic cap-and-trade system that will mobilize market forces to develop and commercialize alternatives to carbon-based fuels. On Tuesday, John McCain will travel to Seattle, where he will participate in a roundtable discussion to solicit the views of environmentalists, conservationists and the business community on the most effective strategies for meeting this challenge.
"A Better Way" will air in the important battleground state of Oregon.

"A Better Way" -- (TV-:30) 
ANNCR: Our environment in peril,
Oil and food prices out of control,
Climate change wreaks havoc with deadly weather.
One extreme thinks high taxes and crippling regulation is the solution.
Another denies the problem even exists.
There's a better way. 
JOHN MCCAIN: I believe that climate change is real.
It's not just a greenhouse gas issue.
It's a national security issue.
We have an obligation to future generations to take action and fix it.
I'm John McCain and I approve this message.
