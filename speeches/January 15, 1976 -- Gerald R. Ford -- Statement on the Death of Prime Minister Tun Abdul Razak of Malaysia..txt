    I WAS saddened to learn of the untimely death of Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak on January 14. Prime Minister Razak, distinguished Southeast Asian leader, was well known and respected for his vision and dedication to peace. Malaysia's many friends will feel his loss deeply. The American people join me in extending condolences and sympathy to his widow and to the Government and people of Malaysia.
I have designated our Ambassador to Malaysia, Francis T. Underhill, Jr., as my special representative at Prime Minister Razak's funeral in Kuala Lumpur January 16.
