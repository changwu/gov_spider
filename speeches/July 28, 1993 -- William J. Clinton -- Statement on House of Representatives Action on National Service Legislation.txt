    By approving my national service plan today with overwhelming support, the House proved that Government can work, without partisan rancor, in a spirit of community, and for the common good.
Now that House Republicans and Democrats have joined in this great act of civic service, I urge Republican Senators to put partisan politics aside and do what is right for this country.
House Members showed the spirit of service that we need in our politics and around the country. Members of both parties recognized that national service isn't Democratic or Republican. It's just plain American, helping young people who help America. The bill embodies principles that Americans from every political viewpoint share: community, responsibility, and opportunity. House Republicans put service ahead of politics. I urge Senate Republicans to do the same.
