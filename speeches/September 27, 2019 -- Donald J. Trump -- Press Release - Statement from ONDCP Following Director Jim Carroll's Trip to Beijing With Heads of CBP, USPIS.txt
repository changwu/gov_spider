During meetings in Beijing this week, White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Jim Carroll secured commitments from China to take further steps and law enforcement action to crack down on illicit fentanyl production and trafficking. These actions include establishing recurring law enforcement cooperation meetings, rapidly responding to leads, expanding detection and narcotics laboratory capabilities, improving tracking of postal shipments, and launching joint investigations.
Because President Trump has been unequivocal on the need for the Chinese government to take a more proactive role in disrupting the flow of illicit fentanyl trafficked globally, Chinese officials agreed to increase cooperation with the United States on this critical issue.
Director Carroll led a delegation that included Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan and Chief Inspector of the United States Postal Inspection Service Gary Barksdale to underscore the importance of keeping fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from coming into the United States.
During their trip, Director Carroll, Acting Commissioner Morgan, and Chief Barksdale met with Chinese officials from the National Narcotics Control Commission, and the Ministry of Public Security, as well as United States Ambassador Terry Branstad. They also met with shipping industry leaders and toured Chinese mail inspection and customs facilities, as well as a national narcotics laboratory.
