    The President proposed a set of common sense initiatives to create jobs and help restore middle class security. Today, the Republicans in the Senate blocked a piece of legislation that helps hard working small business owners and entrepreneurs by giving them a tax credit for hiring and giving their workers raises, alongside incentives for businesses to make new investments in America this year. This proposal builds on the President's continued effort to bolster small businesses, including the 18 small business tax cuts he has signed into law. Unfortunately Republicans continue to play politics rather than supporting concrete proposals to create jobs and strengthen the economy. It's time for Republicans in Congress to get to work on behalf of the American people.
