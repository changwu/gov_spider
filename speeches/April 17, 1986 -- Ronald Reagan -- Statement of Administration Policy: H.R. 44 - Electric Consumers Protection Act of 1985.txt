    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Representative Markey (D) Massachusetts)
While the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 44, it will work for congressional acceptance of a bill that incorporates many of the provisions of the Senate bill, S. 426, which provides FERC with greater administrative flexibility and efficiency in the relicensing of hydroelectric power plant facilities.
