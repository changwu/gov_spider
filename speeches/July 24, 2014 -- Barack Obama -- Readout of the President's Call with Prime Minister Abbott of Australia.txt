    President Obama spoke with Australian Prime Minister Abbott again this evening to discuss Malaysia Airlines flight 17. The President thanked Prime Minister Abbott for Australia's leadership on this issue, including for Australia's willingness to send investigators to the crash site as well as federal police if necessary. The two leaders agree that a prompt, full, unimpeded and transparent international investigation is an imperative, and they expressed their resolve to push for full, immediate, and secure access for international investigators to the crash site. The President underscored that the U.S. will continue to support and coordinate closely with Australia, including at the United Nations Security Council, as this issue moves forward.
