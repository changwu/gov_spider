(House Rules)
(Rep. Price, R-GA, and 141 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2009 because it would cost millions of hard working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve and will drive up premiums for an estimated 20 million people by more than $4,000 a year on average. Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried nearly 40 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.
The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation's health care system. Because of the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of Americans who have previously lacked health insurance will now be covered. The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical conditions will finally be able to purchase a health insurance plan that fits their budget, gives them the care they need, and provides them with the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage. H.R. 2009 will prohibit implementation of the tax credits that are key to this affordable coverage, undermining health security for millions of Americans. At a time when the Congress should be increasing small business tax credits to help make health insurance more affordable, this legislation would take them away.
H.R. 2009 would raise health insurance premiums and increase the number of uninsured Americans and represents another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no plan to replace it or policy to improve it.
If the President were presented with H.R. 2009, he would veto it.
