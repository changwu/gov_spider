    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hochbrueckner (D) NY)
Federal assistance for all applicants and recipients should be treated in a fair and equitable manner. Therefore, the Administration opposes H.R. 1129, which would prohibit counting Agent Orange settlement payments to veterans as income or resources for determining eligibility or benefit levels under any Federal or federally-assisted program.
