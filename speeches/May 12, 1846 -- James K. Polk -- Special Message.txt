    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I herewith transmit to Congress a copy of a communication* from the officer commanding the Army in Texas, with the papers which accompanied it. They were received by the Southern mail of yesterday, some hours after my message of that date had been transmitted, and are of a prior date to one of the communications from the same officer which accompanied that message.
JAMES K. POLK.
*Relating to the operations of the Army near Matamoras, Mexico.
