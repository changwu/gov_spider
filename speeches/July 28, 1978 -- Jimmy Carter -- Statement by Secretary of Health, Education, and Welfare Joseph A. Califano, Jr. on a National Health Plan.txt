    I just have a brief statement which I will read, and then we will deal with the general subject tomorrow at HEW, as you know.
This administration is deeply committed to the goal of decent health care for every American, as our legislative proposals to date have demonstrated. This will be further evident tomorrow when we announce the principles on which the administration's national health plan will be based.
We are also deeply concerned that our national health plan be prudently designed, be phased in in a reasonable and cautious manner, reflect economic and budgetary realities, and avoid the imposition of excessive costs on the average American taxpayer.
Above all, we are committed to proceeding in a prudent manner which does not fuel inflationary pressures.
The President of the United States has broad responsibilities. In devising any program, however basic or important, the President must always bear in mind the impact of that program on other elements of national life and policy, especially on the economy, in inflationary times such as these.
