    The President commends Chairman Hatch and the Senate Judiciary Committee for acting on the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a Judge on the United States Court of Appeals and reporting her nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Justice Owen has served on the Texas Supreme Court since 1995 and was re-elected to that court by an overwhelming majority in 2000 after being endorsed by every major Texas newspaper. She has led a distinguished career and has earned the respect and admiration of those who know her record best, including 15 past presidents of the State Bar of Texas, both Democrats and Republicans, and three former Democrat Justices on the Texas Supreme Court. The American Bar Association unanimously rated her "well-qualified," its highest possible rating.
First nominated on May 9, 2001, Justice Owen has been held up for far too long and it is time for the Senate to rise above the partisan politics and hold an up or down vote on this extremely qualified nominee. When confirmed, she will serve the court and the American people with great distinction.
