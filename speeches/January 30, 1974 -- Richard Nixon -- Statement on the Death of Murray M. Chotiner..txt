    I AM profoundly saddened by the death of Murray Chotiner. For more than a quarter of a century, he was an ally in political battles, a valued counselor, and a trusted colleague. But above all, Murray Chotiner was my friend. His friendship never wavered; in periods of adversity it grew stronger.
While some recoil from the label "politician," Murray was rightly proud of it because he was a professional who had the respect and admiration of those who worked with hint. In life he had my respect and deep friendship; he will forever have my gratitude. I shall miss him.
Mrs. Nixon joins me in extending to his wife, Nancy, and their family, our heartfelt sympathy.
