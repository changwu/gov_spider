    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Yatron (D) Pennsylvania and 55 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2958 because the bill removes the necessary flexibility to determine among many competing priorities how to allocate scarce foreign aid resources most efficiently. The bill earmarks $10 million for new biological diversity activities and specifies that not less than $3 million of that amount be channelled through non-governmental or private and voluntary organizations. The bill would also unnecessarily impose statutory reporting requirements.
