    Seattle â€“ In response to Donald Trump's re-election kickoff today in Orlando, Florida, Washington Governor Jay Inslee released the following statement:
"Donald Trump has divided American families, emboldened white supremacists, attempted to gut health care, brought chaos to foreign policy, and cozied up to fossil fuel companies while the world is facing a climate crisis. America - and the world - cannot afford any more of Donald Trump's dangerous policies.
"President Trump is kicking off his campaign in Orlando, one of the areas that will be worst hit by climate change in the country, and is not doing a dang thing about it. Donald Trump has put Floridians in danger by refusing to act on the climate crisis. Floridians deserve a president who will make defeating climate change the nation's top priority, and who will make Donald Trump a blip in history. That's what I intend to do as president."
Florida is one of the most vulnerable states in the nation to threats from climate change, with an estimated $7.9 billion in property damage from flooding by 2030. In the next 30 years, sea level rise will threaten 64,000 Florida homes. If climate change continues on its current trajectory, that number increases to over one million homes by 2100.
Instead of taking critical steps to address the climate crisis, Trump has denied climate science at every turn, from rolling back Obama-era climate protections, to pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, to mocking the climate crisis on Twitter.
