    We express our continued support for the people of Afghanistan in their effort to establish a government that can bring peace and stability to Afghanistan, close down terrorist camps, and end Afghanistan's use as a platform for international terrorists. We agree that a new Afghan government should adhere to accepted international principles, respect human rights, including those of women and girls, facilitate delivery of aid to combat the current humanitarian crisis, and rebuild Afghanistan and the region economically.
The United States and Russia do not intend to, and cannot, create the future government of Afghanistan. It is up to the Afghans themselves to determine their future. We believe that, in order for any future government to bring peace to the people of Afghanistan and promote stability in the region, it must be broad-based, represent all Afghans, men and women, and be drawn from all ethnic groups. We agree that the Taliban as a movement should have no place in future bodies of state power in Afghanistan.
We welcome the appointment of Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi as the United Nations Secretary General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and underscore our support for his efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and the region.
