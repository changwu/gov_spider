    Hillary and I were greatly saddened to learn of the death in a plane crash of Lieutenant General David J. McCloud, Commander, Alaskan Command. He hosted us several weeks ago at Elmendorf Air Force Base on our way to China and proudly described for us the mission his command carries out in furtherance of our national security interests. General McCloud was a superb airman and an exemplary leader. He helped ensure that our forces from all of the military services were prepared to meet the challenges of the post-cold-war environment. His impact was felt throughout the United States Air Force and the Department of Defense. On behalf of all Americans, we extend our condolences to his family and the men and women of the Alaskan Command that he led so well.
