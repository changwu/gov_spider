    The Dole for President Campaign today announced agreement had been reached between Bob Dole and Republican Platform Committee Chairman Henry Hyde to maintain and strengthen the Republican Party Platform's commitment to the right to life of the unborn, while also asserting the Party's commitment to tolerance and inclusion.
Attached is a Statement of Principles to be included for the first time in the Republican Party Platform, as well as specific statement on tolerance and, for the first time as well, a specific Tolerance Plank. Additionally, attached is language that will be included in the platform's Pro-Life Plank.
In a statement, Bob Dole said, "The Republican Party should maintain its commitment to protecting the unborn. We are also a party that is tolerant of those who do not share our view on every issue. As we head to the Republican Party Convention in San Diego next month, I believe all Republicans -- pro-choice and pro-life -- will come together in support of the Republican Platform and the principles we hold in common."
Platform Chairman Henry Hyde said, "Bob Dole has asserted that the Republican Party should respect diverse points of view on a variety of issues. At the same time, he has reaffirmed our strong commitment to protecting the right to life of the unborn. Bob Dole proposed a good faith effort to address these considerations, and I welcome his initiative. I will include this language in the draft document that will go to San Diego."
