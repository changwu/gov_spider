 In-town pool report No. 1, Nov. 12 
Good morning from the White House, where it is drizzling outside nine days after Election Day, with no public events on POTUS' schedule.
Pool has been tested for COVID-19, using a rapid test method that was once again carried out inside the cramped offices of Lower Press.
Two notable events on the president's schedule: he has lunch with VP Mike Pence in the afternoon and a meeting with the secretary of state and the Treasury secretary at 4 pm.
Both events are closed press. Pool has already made inquiries if there is any reason to think that second one would be opened to allow for remarks from the president. If that happens, pool will update.

 In-town pool report No. 3, Nov. 12 -- no updates on sked 
No updates on the president's schedule.
There was a stretch after the presumed conclusion of the Pence meeting where there was no Marine stationed outside the West Wing, suggesting POTUS was likely not in the Oval.
By around 3 pm a guard was posted outside the West Wing.
Pool has not received any indication POTUS will speak to the media today, including at his 4 pm meeting, or has any plans to concede. Also nothing on officials expecting to be forced out at DHS.
It has been quiet on the grounds today, with some construction going on at the inauguration reviewing stand being assembled north of the building.
