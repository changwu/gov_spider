    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kennelly (D) CT and 2 others)
H.R. 5333 is mislabeled and misleading. It in no way requires adoption of a balanced budget.
H.R. 5333 merely requires the President to submit and the House and Senate Budget Committees to report budgets which are balanced beginning in FY 1998. It does not require Congress to adopt such budgets. Even if it were to require a balanced budget, it could easily be amended or repealed â€” because it does not have Constitutional standing. Therefore, the Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 5333.
