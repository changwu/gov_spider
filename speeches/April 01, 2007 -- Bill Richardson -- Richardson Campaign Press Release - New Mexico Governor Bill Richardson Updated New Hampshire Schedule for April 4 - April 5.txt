    This is the updated schedule of campaign events in New Hampshire for Governor Bill Richardson for April 4 through April 6.
Next week Governor Richardson will be in New Hampshire for a series of campaign activities, including several town meetings where the Governor will give brief remarks followed by a question and answer session with residents. Governor Richardson will also be touring the Stonyfield Yogurt facility, touring the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and speaking to a group of College Democrats at Dartmouth College. In August 2005, Governor Bill Richardson helped successfully lobby the BRAC commission to overturn their decision to close the navy base in Portsmouth.
The Governor will return to New Mexico Thursday night, April 5.
