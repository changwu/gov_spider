    "So you have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird. I actually think we need to have a president who talks about saving the American people and saving good jobs and saving our future and also saving the family farm." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "About 23 million Americans, still looking for a good job. You've got college graduates this year, came out last spring, who are still looking for work. About half the college graduates that came out couldn't find a job or a college-level job. Food stamps—when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps. Now there are 47 million people on food stamps. I mean, these are these are tough times with real serious issues. So you have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird. I actually think we need to have a president who talks about saving the American people and saving good jobs and saving our future and also saving the family farm."
