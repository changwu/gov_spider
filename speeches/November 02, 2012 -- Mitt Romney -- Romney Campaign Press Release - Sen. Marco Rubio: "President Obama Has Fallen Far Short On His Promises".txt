    Florida Senator Marco Rubio today made the following statement on the October unemployment report:
"Today's jobs report underscores the big choice voters face in this election between four more years of anemic job growth, or the prospect of 12 million new jobs. President Obama has fallen far short of his promises on jobs and the economy, and his second-term agenda will only yield more of the same job-killing taxes and regulations that have left middle-class families struggling. America needs a new direction, and Mitt Romney is the leader with the proven record and the plan to deliver the real recovery and the real change our country needs."
