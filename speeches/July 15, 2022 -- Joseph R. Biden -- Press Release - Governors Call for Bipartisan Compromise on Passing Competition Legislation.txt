    WASHINGTON â€“ Today, National Governors Association Chairman Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Vice Chairman Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey released the following statement as the House and Senate continue deliberations on supply chain legislation.
"Governors have been encouraged by the bipartisan efforts in Congress to pass a compromise bill supporting American innovation and competitiveness. We are supportive of many provisions in the House and Senate versions of the bill, including significant funding for computer science education, which is crucial to our ability to train the next generation of tech talent right here at home. We urge Congress to quickly come to an agreement on this important legislation.
"While differences remain between the House and Senate bills, Governors on both sides of the aisle agree that the $52 billion in federal investments for the domestic semiconductor research, design and manufacturing provisions in the CHIPS Act is absolutely critical to our national security and will allow us to address gaps and vulnerabilities in the U.S. supply chain.
"Governors call on the Senate to take up and pass the CHIPS legislation as soon as possible, followed by a speedy vote in the House, to ensure we have the tools necessary to meet the needs of our businesses and the 21st century workforce. We encourage Congress to stay in session and pass this before they adjoin for August recess."
