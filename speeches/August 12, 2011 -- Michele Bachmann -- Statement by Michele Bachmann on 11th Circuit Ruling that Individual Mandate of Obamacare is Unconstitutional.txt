    Pella, Iowa â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement in response to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the individual mandate of Obamacare is unconstitutional:
"The news today from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that the individual mandate of Obamacare is unconstitutional is welcome relief to millions of individuals and businesses that would have been subjected to this law against their wishes. I call on President Obama and Congress to cease enforcement of the remaining provisions of Obamacare immediately. Removing the individual mandate from Obamacare deprives it of the revenue necessary to pay for the bill. Implementing the remaining provisions without the mandate would dramatically increase our budget deficit and do further harm to our economy and further imperil The United States credit rating.
"Obamacare is the largest entitlement program in the history of the United States and will cost American taxpayers more than $500 billion in new taxes and cost Americans over 800,000 jobs, according the Congressional Budget Office. It is the centerpiece of the President's failed economic policies. It is time for the President to admit now what the courts have affirmed, that the law is unconstitutional, and withdraw it so we can put our country back on the path to economic prosperity."
