Hillary has been fighting for families her entire life, and as first lady of the United States, she championed important causes that made a real difference in their lives. Here are seven of her top accomplishments as first lady. ?

1. She led the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, where she cast a global spotlight on violence against women.
2. She co-convened a White House Summit on School Violence after the mass shooting at Columbine High School and supported the Brady Bill.
3. She worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million kids and cut the uninsured rate for American children in half.

4. She helped pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which improved the foster care system and provided new financial incentives for states to move children to permanent adoptive homes. The number of adoptions from foster care doubled across the country within five years of its passage.
5. She hosted the White House Conferences on Early Childhood Development and Child Care to encourage early learning.

6. She hosted the first-ever White House Convening on Latino Children and Youth to help ensure Latino children have the opportunities succeed.
7. She fought for veterans suffering from Gulf War syndrome, urging a presidential commission to investigate why thousands of veterans came home from the Persian Gulf War with illness and ailments.
