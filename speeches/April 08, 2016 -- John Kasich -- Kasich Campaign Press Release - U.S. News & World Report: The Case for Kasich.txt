Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's big win in Wisconsin was the shot in the arm that he needed, allowing him to say that Wisconsin was a "turning point – it is a rallying cry" – which I'm not sure is truly the case.—

So let's consider the case for John Kasich. He's outlasted early favorites like Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Scott Walker. As of this week, Kasich is the only Republican in the race who consistently beats Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup, winning by a six-point average margin on Real Clear Politics. He's also the only Republican with higher favorables than unfavorables, by 43 to 30, a 13-point positive margin.—
