    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
H.R. 6760 - Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018(Rep. Davis, R-IL, and 40 cosponsors) 
H.R. 6757 - Family Savings Act of 2018(Rep. Kelly, R-PA, and 29 cosponsors)
H.R. 6756 - American Innovation Act of 2018(Rep. Buchanan, R-FL, and 26 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018, H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018, and H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018.
H.R. 6760 would make permanent the individual tax reductions and reforms enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, preventing a tax increase on millions of middle-income families and small businesses after 2025.
H.R. 6757 would provide additional tax benefits to help middle-income families save for retirement, a child's education, and other life events.
Finally, H.R. 6756 would assist start-up companies and entrepreneurs by allowing them to write off more costs associated with starting their new business and by allowing them to raise capital and expand without losing their previously accrued tax benefits.
These bills advance the Administration's goals of growing the economy, reforming the tax code, and providing tax relief to small businesses and middle-income families.
If H.R. 6760, H.R. 6757, and H.R. 6756 were presented to the President in their current forms, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bills into law.
