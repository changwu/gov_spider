    Americans across the country are back to work at a historic level. Right now, workers in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are less likely to be unemployed than in any other time on record. The unemployment rate did not increase in any of our 50 States.
This news comes on the heels of new data showing that the number of Americans who are forced to rely on unemployment insurance programs for their support fell to its lowest level in over 52 years and that the economy has added more than 8 million jobs since I took office, more jobs on average per month than under any other President in history.
This job creation is no accident; it's the direct result of my economic plan to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out through the historic American Rescue Plan and a nationwide vaccination strategy. There is more work to do to build an economy that works for all Americans. Tackling inflation is my top priority. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that millions of workers are now able to better provide for themselves and their families and enjoy the dignity that a good-paying job provides.
