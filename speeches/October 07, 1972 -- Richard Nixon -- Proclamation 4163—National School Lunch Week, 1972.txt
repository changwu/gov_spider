  A Proclamation

The National School Lunch Program, now in its twenty-sixth year, has become one of the Nation's most important programs for safeguarding the health and wellbeing of America's children.
Last year some 25 million children shared nearly four billion lunches served in their schools. Of these, nearly one-third were needy youngsters who were fed without charge.
This program has expanded at such a rapid rate—today it is nearly two and one-half times as large as it was three years ago—that we can now foresee the day when the hunger gap will be closed across America.
Through the efforts of local, State, and Federal agencies and private groups and organizations, children in over 82,000 schools now can buy a nutritious lunch at low cost—or enjoy a free lunch.
In recognition of the fact that the National School Lunch Program involves a community effort, dependent upon the interest and support of citizens, the Congress, by a joint resolution of October 9, 1962, designated the week beginning on the second Sunday of October each year as National School Lunch Week, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe the week of October 8, 1972, as National School Lunch Week, to give special and deserved recognition to the role of good nutrition in building a stronger America through its youth.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.

RICHARD NIXON
