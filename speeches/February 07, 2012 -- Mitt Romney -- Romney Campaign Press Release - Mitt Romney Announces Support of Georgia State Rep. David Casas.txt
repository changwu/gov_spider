    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Georgia State Representative David Casas.
"I'm happy to have David's support," said Mitt Romney. "David shares my vision of promoting conservative economic policies to create jobs and get our country back on track. I look forward to sharing this message with all Georgians in the months to come with his help."
"I am proud to endorse Mitt Romney," said State Representative David Casas. "Over the last few weeks, I have had a serious change of heart. While I initially supported Speaker Gingrich, his continued attacks upon the free enterprise system that has made our country great are particularly something I will not stand for. I look forward to joining the team and urge my fellow Georgians to support the clear conservative that will fight for the America we love, Mitt Romney."
