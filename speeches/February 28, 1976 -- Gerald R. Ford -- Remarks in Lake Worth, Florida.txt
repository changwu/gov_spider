    Let me express as enthusiastically as I can my great appreciation for all of you wonderful people coming out in the fine, fine weather you always have here in Florida. [Laughter]
But, you know, to have this many people come and say hello and express their best wishes to indicate their support makes up for all of the little raindrops that might have dropped on the way down here.
Mr. Mayor and members of the City Council and all the wonderful people of Lake Worth, I do want to take a minute. This country is based on freedom-freedom from government oppression, freedom from fear of war, freedom of a healthy, strong, burgeoning economy. That is what we want in America, and we are going to get it with the help and assistance of wonderful people like you have right here in Lake Worth.
I don't know what you are going to do the rest of the afternoon, but I can tell you I am looking forward to seeing all of the other wonderful people from Florida, just like you. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome, your enthusiastic reception.
Mr. Mayor and all of you who are here, I just will never forget this experience in Lake Worth. I thank you.
Good luck and God bless you.
