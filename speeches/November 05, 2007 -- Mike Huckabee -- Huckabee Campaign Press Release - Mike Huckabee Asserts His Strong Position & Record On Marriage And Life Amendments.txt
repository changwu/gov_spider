    LITTLE ROCK, AR - Former AR Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement today regarding an interview by former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson (TN) on NBC's "Meet the Press."
"Senator Thompson's comments on 'Meet the Press' were disappointing and disheartening for those who were expecting him to be a solid voice for conservatives. The marriage and life amendments are critical issues for those of us who have been on the front lines of these cultural battles. Sen. Thompson's philosophy seems to be more 'cut and run' when it comes to these issues, rather than stand and lead.
"I've always supported the passage of a constitutional amendment to protect the right to life. As President, I will fight for passage of a human life amendment. My position on the sanctity of life has always been clear and consistent. No candidate has a stronger record on the sanctity of life than I do. As Governor of Arkansas, I successfully led efforts to promote a human life amendment and marriage amendment in my state. For me, it isn't just talk; it's a conservative record of leadership and conviction."
