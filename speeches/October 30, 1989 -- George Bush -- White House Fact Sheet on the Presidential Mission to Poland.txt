    In his continuing efforts to assist Polish reform, the President today announced the formation of a Presidential mission to travel to Poland at the end of November to examine the new government's economic plan and to advise the President on the best ways of assuring the effective use of U.S. assistance. The mission will be led by Secretaries Yeutter, Mosbacher, and Dole and Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Boskin. It will consist primarily of corporate and labor leaders, economists, and other experts from the private sector, including, among others, Lane Kirkland, Murray Wiedenbaum [professor at Washington University], Michael Harper (CON-AGRA), John McGillicuddy (Manufacturers Hanover), Gale Johnson and Arnold Harberger (University of Chicago), Robert Georgine (AFL - CIO), and Edward Moskal (Polish American Congress).
The mission will focus on those economic sectors where U.S. expertise and experience can be of greatest assistance -- agriculture, business management, industry, financial services -- as well as studying Poland's overall plan of structural, macroeconomic, and price reforms. The Presidential mission will report its findings to the President and share them with the European Communities Commission and with others in the 24-nation Group for Economic Assistance to Poland and Hungary. The mission will depart on November 29 and return on December 2.
This initial mission will be followed by experts missions in key economic sectors. In addition, administration economists will examine urgently the structural economic challenges Poland will face now and in the years ahead so that we can provide the most effective help possible to the Polish people in their reform efforts.
