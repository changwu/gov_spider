    Following his call to Duane Jackson yesterday, the President this morning made calls to Lance Orton and Officers Wayne Rhatigan and Pam Duffy to thank them for their vigilance. Lance Orton and Duane Jackson were the vendors who first reported the suspicious vehicle. Officers Rhatigan and Duffy were the officers on the scene whose actions led to the evacuation of the area and the immediate response.
