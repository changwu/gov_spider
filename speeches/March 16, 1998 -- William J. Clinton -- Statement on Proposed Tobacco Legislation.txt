    I congratulate the public health and tobacco producer communities for working together to promote bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation that dramatically reduces youth smoking and protects American farmers and their communities. I am firmly committed to protecting farmers and their communities and have made this commitment one of the five key elements that I will insist upon before signing tobacco legislation. I hope you will continue your efforts to expand your coalition and to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation this year that protects our Nation's children.
