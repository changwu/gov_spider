    Today, the fifth of May, is an important holiday for persons of Mexican ancestry.
This commemorates the victory at Puebla, Mexico, in 1862 against the French and symbolizes the freedom of people of Mexican heritage from the yoke of colonialism.
Mexican traditions in America predate the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock. Over the years, these traditions have deeply influenced the life of this country and manifest themselves in the architecture, music, literature, language, family, and customs of America.
On this day of remembrance and celebration, I ask all Americans to join me in extending to our fellow citizens of Mexican heritage warmest greetings for a joyous and festive cinco de mayo!
