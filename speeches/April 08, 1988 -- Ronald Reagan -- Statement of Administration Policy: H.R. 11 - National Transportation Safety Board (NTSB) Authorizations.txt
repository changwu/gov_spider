    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Mineta (D) California and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 11 unless it is amended to:

—    authorize, consistent with the President's FY 1989 Budget request, appropriations of $24,617 million for 1989 and $25,444 million for 1990; and
—    provide that any fees charged for (a) non-Federal personnel taking the'NTSB training course or (b) accident investigations conducted by the NTSB for other Federal agencies or governments be deposited in the General Fund rather than used to augment the NTSB appropriation. 
The Administration urges that H.R. 11 not be considered under suspension of the rules and that it be amended accordingly.
