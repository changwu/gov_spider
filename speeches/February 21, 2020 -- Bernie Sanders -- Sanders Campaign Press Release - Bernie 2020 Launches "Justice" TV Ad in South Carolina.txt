    COLUMBIA â€“ Bernie 2020 today launched their second South Carolina television ad ahead of the state's February 29 primary.
The new ad, titled "Justice" and voiced by renowned actor and activist Danny Glover, focuses on criminal justice reform and Sen. Bernie Sanders' long history fighting for equal justice for all as well as his plan to end police misconduct and cash bail, legalize marijuana and expunge past marijuana convictions.
Sanders has made criminal justice reform a cornerstone of his campaign, particularly in South Carolina, announcing his landmark Justice and Safety for All plan in Columbia's historic Greenview neighborhood back in August.
The full ad, "Justice," can be seen here and the transcript is below:
Our criminal justice system lets the crooks on Wall Street who destroyed our economy walk free, while 1 in 3 black men go to prison.
Bernie Sanders is fighting for justice and always has.
He'll fix our broken justice system so that it works for everyone, not just the wealthy.
He'll end police misconduct and cash bail,
legalize marijuana and expunge past convictions,
And invest in jobs and education instead of jails and incarceration.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
