    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on July 24, 2001, together with an exchange of notes, as amended by the Protocol signed at Washington on July 19, 2002 (the "Convention"). I also transmit the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention.
The proposed Convention transmitted herewith would replace the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, signed at London on December 31, 1975, as modified by a subsequent agreement and protocols.
This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and other developed nations, provides for maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income, protection from double taxation of income, and for the exchange of information. The Convention also contains rules making its benefits unavailable to persons who are engaged in treaty shopping. The proposed Convention is the first U.S. income tax convention to provide a zero rate of withholding on certain direct investment dividends.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
