    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Horton (R) New York)
The administration fully supports completion of land acquisition under the National Park Service's general management plan for the Women's Rights National Historical Park. Accordingly, the administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2952, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to reduce the bill's appropriation authorization ceiling for land acquisition in the Park from $700,000 to $530,000. This lower amount is all that is needed to acquire a theater, the only unacquired tract of those identified for fee acquisition under the Act that established the Park.
