You just can't win with the Fake News Media. A big story today is that because I have pushed so hard and gotten Gasoline Prices so low more people are driving and I have caused traffic jams throughout our Great Nation. Sorry everyone!Retweets: 38571Favorites: 169831

Justice Roberts can say what he wants but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster. It is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country 79% & is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security...Retweets: 27034Favorites: 106655

....and Safety at the Border or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe. Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB! If not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death. We want the Constitution as written!Retweets: 23501Favorites: 97395

Will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at 9:00 A.M. Eastern. Then it will be off to see our Coast Guard patriots & to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes. Happy Thanksgiving!Retweets: 16717Favorites: 84492

Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit. Nevertheless they are working hard to make America a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins!Retweets: 28093Favorites: 116801
