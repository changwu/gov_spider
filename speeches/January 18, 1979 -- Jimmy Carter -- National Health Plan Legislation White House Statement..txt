    The President was briefed today by Secretary Califano on proposals for national health plan legislation to be submitted to the Congress this year, including a number of options for phasing in a national health plan. The President made no decision among the options.
He instructed Secretary Califano immediately to undertake broad consultations with the Congress, with Governors, and with outside groups which have evidenced interest in a national health plan, including the AFL-CIO and the UAW, as well as health-related organizations.
He asked the Secretary to expedite these consultations and to report back to him as soon as possible, hopefully within 4 weeks.
The President will ultimately determine what legislation to submit to the Congress based upon these consultations and upon further internal analysis of the options presented to him.
Present at the meeting were the President, the Vice President, Secretary Califano, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Charles Schultze, OMB Director Jim Mcintyre, Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy Stu Eizenstat, and other staff aides.
The meeting in the Cabinet Room lasted from 2 p.m. until approximately 4
