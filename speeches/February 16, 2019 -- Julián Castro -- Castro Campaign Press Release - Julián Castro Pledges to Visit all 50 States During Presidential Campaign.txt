    Democratic Presidential Candidate to Make First Campaign Trip to Iowa Next Week
SAN ANTONIO, TX (February 16, 2019) – Today, Democratic presidential candidate, and former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and San Antonio Mayor, Julián Castro, pledged to visit all 50 states during his campaign. Noting that as HUD Secretary he visited 40 states, providing him with a strong sense of the "issues most important to the people" he served, Castro pledged "When I'm President, everyone will count."
The campaign will engage with supporters via digital platforms to bring Secretary Castro to their states.
The pledge was made via Twitter and other social media platforms:https://twitter.com/JulianCastro/status/1096813389685424128
"As someone from a state that's largely been ignored by presidential campaigns for most of the past four decades, I know how much it means for the people in every state to have a chance to be heard by the men and women seeking to become their President. During my time in public service, I had the chance to visit over 40 states, which helped me understand the issues most important to the people I served. I want to do that again. Over the course of my campaign, I will visit every state in our nation to hear directly from you. I've already visited a handful of states —plus Puerto Rico, which was my first stop of this campaign — and that number will grow as we get to every single state to send an important message: When I'm President, everyone will count. #OneNationOneDestiny"
Secretary Castro has already traveled to Puerto Rico, along with several other states, including New Hampshire, California, Arizona, Florida and his home state of Texas. Next week, Secretary Castro will make his first trip as a declared candidate to Iowa.
