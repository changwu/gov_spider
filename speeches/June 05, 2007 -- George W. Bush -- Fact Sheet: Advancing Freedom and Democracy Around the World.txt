    U.S. Pursues Freedom Agenda By Strengthening Support For Democratic Dissidents, Helping Build Democratic Institutions
Today, At An International Conference On Democracy And Security In Prague, Czech Republic, President Bush Discussed Steps America Has Taken And Will Take In Pursuit Of The Freedom Agenda. In his Second Inaugural Address, President Bush pledged America to the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in the world. The President traveled to Prague to discuss U.S. actions in support of this goal. Today's conference, "Democracy and Security: Core Values and Sound Policies," was convened by three of the great modern advocates for freedom: Jose Maria Aznar, Vaclav Havel, and Natan Sharansky.



    The United States Is Committed To The Advance Of Freedom And Democracy As The Great Alternatives To Repression And Radicalism. The most powerful weapon in the struggle against extremism is the universal appeal of freedom. Freedom is the best way to unleash the creativity and economic potential of a nation, the only ordering of a society that leads to justice, and the only way to achieve human rights.

Expanding Freedom Is More Than A Moral Imperative - It Is The Only Realistic Way To Protect Our People. The 9/11 attacks were evidence of an international movement of violent Islamic extremists that threatens free people everywhere. Nations that commit to freedom for their people will not support extremists; they will join in defeating them.

Under The Freedom Agenda, America Is Helping Emerging Democracies Build The Institutions That Sustain Liberty
The United States Has Nearly Doubled Funding For Democracy Projects Since 2001. The President's FY 2008 Budget requests nearly $1.5 billion in funding for Democracy, Governance and Human Rights - up from less than $700 million in 2001. In addition, funding for the National Endowment for Democracy has more than doubled from $31 million to $80 million since 2001.
It Is The Responsibility Of Those Who Enjoy The Blessings Of Liberty To Help Those Who Are Struggling To Establish Free Societies.


America is working with its partners in the G-8 to promote the rise of a vibrant civil society in the Middle East through initiatives like the Forum for the Future.


America is cooperating side-by-side with the new democracies in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan.


The United States congratulates the people of Yemen on their landmark presidential election and the people of Kuwait on elections in which women were able to vote and run for office for the first time.


The U.S. stands firmly behind the people of Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq as they defend their democratic gains against extremist enemies.

America Is Also Using Its Influence To Urge Valued Partners Like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, And Pakistan To Move Toward Freedom. These nations have taken brave stands and strong action to confront extremists, along with some steps to expand liberty and transparency. Yet they have a great distance still to travel. The U.S. will continue to press nations like these to open up their political systems and give a greater voice to their people.
