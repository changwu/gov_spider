    Hillary Clinton released the following statement today after NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC (NARAL) endorsed her campaign for President.
"I am honored to earn the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC. As one of our country's leading advocates for reproductive rights, NARAL's work is more important than ever. Women's health and rights are under attack across America. In Texas, state leaders are taking their fight to cut women off from access to safe and legal abortion all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Colorado Springs, a violent extremist targeted a health center. Meanwhile, Congress has voted to restrict reproductive rights and cut women off from access to affordable health care. And one after another, Republicans running for President have pledged to cut funding for Planned Parenthood; restrict abortion access; and repeal the Affordable Care Act, which ensures that women will no longer be charged more just for being women.
"In January 2017, a new President will walk into the Oval Office. We cannot afford to elect a Republican who will rip away the progress women have made. We need to protect and advance reproductive rights, not allow politicians to interfere in women's personal health decisions. I will stand with NARAL and women across the country in defending access to abortion, contraception, and sex education. I will stand with NARALin advocating for policies that help women and families. The stakes could not be higher in this election, and I am grateful to the more than 1 million members of NARAL for their support."
