Whereas the Congress by joint resolution has authorized and requested the President of the United States of America to proclaim annually that May Day is Child Health Day; and
Whereas the health and welfare of our children concern not only their parents, but also the nation at large; and
Whereas the observance of such a day gives us opportunity to unite in furthering the health and protection of our children;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate May 1 of this year as Child Health Day, and call upon all agencies, public and private, and all individuals having the interest of children at heart, to set aside that day for earnest consideration of the needs of the children in their communities and in their homes and to inaugurate constructive activities to protect and promote the health and physical vigor of the youth of our nation.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-seventh.
