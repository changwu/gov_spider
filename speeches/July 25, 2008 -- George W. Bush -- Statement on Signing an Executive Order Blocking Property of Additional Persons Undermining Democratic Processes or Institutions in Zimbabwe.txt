    Today I have signed a new Executive order that expands our sanctions against the illegitimate Government of Zimbabwe. The new Executive order significantly enhances our ability to designate individuals in and entities connected to the Mugabe regime. Under the new Executive order, the Treasury Department will today designate several of these Government-controlled entities.
This action is a direct result of the Mugabe regime's continued politically motivated violence, disregarding calls from the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, and the United Nations to halt the attacks. The regime has also continued its ban against NGO activities that would provide assistance to the suffering and vulnerable people of Zimbabwe. No regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences.
Should ongoing talks in South Africa between Mugabe's regime and the Movement of Democratic Change result in a new government that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, the United States stands ready to provide a substantial assistance package, development aid, and normalization with international financial institutions.
In the meantime, I am reaffirming my commitment to support the suffering people of Zimbabwe, authorizing the use of up to $2.5 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to assist Zimbabwean refugees and asylum seekers who have been displaced due to the ongoing violence in their country. We will also continue our efforts to provide food and health assistance as part of our commitment to help the people of Zimbabwe in their time of greatest need.
