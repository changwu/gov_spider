    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Ros-Lehtinen and 129 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 748, which would protect the health and safety of minors by ensuring that valid and constitutional State parental involvement laws are not circumvented. This bill is consistent with the Administration's view that parents' efforts to be involved in their children's lives should be protected and the widespread belief among authorities in the field that the parents of pregnant minors are best suited to provide them with counsel, guidance, and support.
