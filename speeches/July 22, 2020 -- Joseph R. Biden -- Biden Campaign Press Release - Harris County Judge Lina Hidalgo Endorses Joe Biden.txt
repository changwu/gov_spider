    Today, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I cannot think of a better leader to step into the Oval Office than Joe Biden. He has the grit, experience, and empathy to lead our nation in this incredibly troubling time. Joe is a leader our country can count on to deliver for our families, from health care to education. I am determined to do everything I can to elect Joe Biden and return steady, principled leadership to the White House."
Judge Hidalgo joins a growing list of distinguished Texas endorsers, including former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, Congressional Black Caucus members Eddie Bernice Johnson, Sheila Jackson Lee, Marc Veasey, and Colin Allred; Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, Veronica Escobar, Sylvia Garcia, Filemon Vela, Vicente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar; Austin Mayor Steven Adler and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner; as well as Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Carol Alvarado and State House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner.
