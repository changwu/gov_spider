    Sioux City, Iowa â€” Iowa State Senator Brad Zaun has endorsed Michele Bachmann for the Republican nomination in the 2012 Iowa presidential caucus, and will be joining her Iowa team as the state co-chairman.
"We are thrilled to have someone of Senator Zaun's caliber joining our team as our Iowa co-chairman. Brad has owned his own business and he knows what it's like to make a payroll, and sign the front of a paycheck," Bachmann said. "As a senator, Brad has fought for our conservative values in the Iowa Legislature and I'm very excited to have him beside me in my effort to take those values to the White House."
Senator Zaun is the former owner of Zaun's Trustworthy Hardware store and presently works as a commercial realtor. Prior to his election to the Iowa Legislature, Zaun has served the people of Urbandale as mayor, and was the Republican nominee for United States Congress in the 3rd District in 2010. Senator Zaun and his wife, Bedi, reside in Urbandale.
"I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and get to work for Michele Bachmann in Iowa," said Sen. Zaun. "In this race for president, Michele has shown she has the credentials and experience needed to help solve the difficult issues facing the American people. With her leadership, we will be on our way to making Barack Obama a one-term president."
