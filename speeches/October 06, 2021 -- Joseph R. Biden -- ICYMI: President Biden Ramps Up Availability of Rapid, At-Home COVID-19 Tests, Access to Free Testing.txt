    Today, the Biden Administration announced it is on track to quadruple the amount of rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests available for Americans by December to more than 200 million tests a month, and increase the number of places Americans can access free COVID-19 testing to 30,000 community-based sites around the country.
As part of today's announcement, the Administration is making an additional $1 billion investment to further mobilize COVID-19 testing production and procure an additional 180 million rapid, at-home tests by the end of the year. This builds on a $2 billion investment the President announced in September to ensure COVID-19 tests are available to those who need them and expand testing production.
In September, the President also committed to expanding the number of pharmacies in the federal government's free testing program to 10,000 local pharmacies across the country. We are on track to meet that goal in the coming weeks and are now doubling our commitment to 20,000 pharmacies, which will bring the total number of community-based free testing sites in the U.S. to 30,000.

President Biden in September said that he would use the Defense Production Act to increase the production of rapid testing kits and would work with retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, to expand their availability. He pledged $2 billion to the effort, or roughly 280 million tests."

"Carole Johnson, the White House testing director, said the announcement will 'help to send a signal to manufacturers to ramp up production, and that's why we're confident here that we'll see increased production. In the coming weeks all of the major impacts of these major investments and improvements will be visible,' she said. The White House, she said, has also secured commitments from leading retailers to sell the tests at cost and they're arranging for tests to be distributed through food banks and community health centers. 'We're continuing to work on the cost issue,' Johnson said."
