Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the announcement of advancements in stem-cell research:
"New developments confirm that cutting edge science and ethical principles are not opposed to one another. Scientists have provided a means for producing new cells functionally identical to embryonic stem cells without creating or destroying embryos and without the need to exploit women for their eggs. This is a result the whole public can celebrate. The scientists deserve credit for their genius, but equally, the voices insisting on ethical science and respect for human life provided the incentive for this revolutionary research."
