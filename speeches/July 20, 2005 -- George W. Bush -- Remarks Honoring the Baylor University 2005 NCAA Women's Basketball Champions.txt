    The President. Congratulations. Welcome. I thought I'd have my picture with you, and then we'll go into the Oval Office.
It is my honor to welcome some highly successful women from the neighborhood. [Laughter] First, I want to congratulate the coach. She'sâ€”obviously knows what she's doing. But I love her spirit. I love her can-do spirit that says, "We're going to win, and we're proud to win."
And I appreciate the women who are here too. The Lady Bears were really great. And I know I'm supposed to be working hard, but I watched you. [Laughter] And I was really impressed. And I want to thank you for being such great athletes and such wonderful role models. And I appreciate you representing Baylor University, which is a great university, so well, with such class.
I'm here to welcome you to the Rose Garden and congratulate you for a job well done and wish one of you a happy birthday. [Laughter]
All right, have at it. [Laughter]
[At this point, team members presented the President with gifts.]
The President. Ten, two, and four. [Laughter] Congratulations. All right, anybody want to see the Oval Office? Let's go look at it.
