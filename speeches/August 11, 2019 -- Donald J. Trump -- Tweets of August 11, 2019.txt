Anthony Scaramucci who was quickly terminated (11 days) from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on 'President Trump.' Like many other so-called television experts he knows very little about me.....Retweets: 22781Favorites: 119372

.....other than the fact that this Administration has probably done more than any other Administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence. Anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on TV and it's not for being the Mooch!Retweets: 17162Favorites: 96936

So funny to watch Little Donny Deutsch on TV with his own failing show. When I did The Apprentice Donny would call me (along with @ErinBurnett & others) and BEG to be on that VERY successful show. He had the TV 'bug' & I would let him come on though he (& Erin) had very little..Retweets: 15658Favorites: 84494

..TV talent. Then during the 2016 Election I would watch as Joe Scarborough & his very angry Psycho wife(?) would push Donny to the point of total humiliation. He would never fight back because he wanted to stay on TV even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition!Retweets: 13817Favorites: 76842

Many incredible things are happening right now for our Country. After years of being ripped off by other nations on both Trade Deals and the Military things are changing fast. Big progress is being made. America is respected again. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!Retweets: 28668Favorites: 130437
