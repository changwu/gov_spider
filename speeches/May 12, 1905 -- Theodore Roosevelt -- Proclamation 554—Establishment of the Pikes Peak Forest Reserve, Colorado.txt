    
  By the President of the United States of America
  A Proclamation

Whereas, The Pikes Peak Timber Land Reserve, The Plum Creek Timber Land Reserve and the South Platte Forest Reserve, in the State of Colorado, have been heretofore established by proclamations, under the provisions of the acts of March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes", and June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes";
And Whereas, it appears proper that the greater portion of the area embraced in said forest reserves, with the addition thereto of certain lands, should be included in one reserve and be designated by one name; and it appears that the public lands in the State of Colorado, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving the same as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid acts of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that the proclamations heretofore issued respecting said forest reserves are hereby superseded, and The Pikes Peak Forest Reserve is hereby established in place thereof, with boundaries as follows:

Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired: Provided , That this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made;
Provided further, That nothing herein shall give any force or effect to any claim or right to any of the lands heretofore embraced within the reserves hereby consolidated which would not have been entitled to recognition if said reserves as heretofore established had been continued in force without being merged into a single reserve as herein-before provided.
The lands hereby excluded from the reserve and restored to the public domain shall be open to settlement from the date hereof, but shall not be subject to entry, filing or selection until after ninety days' notice by such publication as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 12th day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-ninth.
