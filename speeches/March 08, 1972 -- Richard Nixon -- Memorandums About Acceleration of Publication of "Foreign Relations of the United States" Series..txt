    Memorandum for the Secretary of State:
SUBJECT: Acceleration of Publication of "Foreign Relations" Series
The official documentary series "Foreign Relations of the United States," published by the Department of State, has for many years provided the American public with an indispensable perspective on our Nation's history. The materials now being published, however, relate to the events of 1946, and I think that in the interests of a better informed public the length of time between event and publication should be shortened. Accordingly, I ask that, without impairing the quality and comprehensive nature of the series, you immediately institute a program to reduce this time lag to 20 years. Your objective should be to make this reduction within the next 3 years and to keep the publication point at 20 years from then on.
In order to achieve this goal in the most expeditious manner, I am today instructing the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to cooperate fully with you in collecting and declassifying the appropriate materials to the maximum extent consistent with the requirements of national security.
