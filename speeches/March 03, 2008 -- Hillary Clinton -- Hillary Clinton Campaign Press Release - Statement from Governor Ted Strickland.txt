    At a rally this morning in Toledo, OH, Governor Ted Strickland made the following remarks regarding a memo that has surfaced confirming communication between Sen. Obama's top economic advisor, Austan Goolsbee and the Canadian embassy about NAFTA.
It's important that the people of Ohio understand that it has recently come to light that Senator Clinton's opponent has a chief economic advisor that is reported to have talked with the leadership, the governmental leadership in Canada indicating to him that her opponent's not terribly serious about what he's saying in Ohio about NAFTA but this is just political rhetoric. Well, we people in Ohio believe that you ought to say what you mean and you ought to mean what you say.
