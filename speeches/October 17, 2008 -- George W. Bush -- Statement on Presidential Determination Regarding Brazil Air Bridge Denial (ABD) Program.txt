    The President has authorized the Department of State to continue assistance to Brazil in carrying out an "Air Bridge Denial Program" against civil aircraft reasonably suspected of trafficking in illicit drugs. In granting this authorization, the President has determined that interdiction of illicit drug trafficking aircraft in Brazil's airspace remains necessary because of the extraordinary threat posed by such trafficking to Brazil's national security. Further, the President has determined Brazil has appropriate procedures in place to protect against the innocent loss of life in connection with such interdiction. The United States Department of State, with the support of other U.S. agencies, has the ability to continue to work with the Government of Brazil to ensure effective counternarcotics operations while observing strict adherence to agreed-upon and well-established safety procedures.
