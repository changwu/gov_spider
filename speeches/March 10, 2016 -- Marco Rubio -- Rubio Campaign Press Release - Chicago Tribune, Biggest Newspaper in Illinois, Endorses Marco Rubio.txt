The Chicago Tribune, the biggest newspaper in Illinois, just endorsed Marco for president.
In their bold editorial, the Tribune praises Marco for his breadth of foreign policy experience and next generation conservative solutions:
No candidate in this cycle has ridden more ups and downs than Marco Rubio. With so much attention paid to quirks — his debate repetitions, his perspiration, even his choice of boots — many Republicans seem not to have noticed his fundamental GOP message of opportunity and uplift. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation calculated that the tax plan Rubio floated with Sen. Mike Lee would raise after-tax incomes for the bottom 10 percent of earners by 44 percent, chiefly via expanded credits. Spending limits, line-item veto, a balanced-budget amendment — all Rubio policy pillars. Crucially, his foreign affairs expertise vastly exceeds that of his rivals. We like his youth, his bilingual fluency and the fact that he isn't one more Republican who's been standing in line, awaiting his turn to run.
Right here is where liberal and conservative critics fire howitzers at this or that Rubio drawback. We look forward to debating those points in a general election campaign. But we won't be able to do so if Trump or Cruz is the nominee. The Tribune today endorses Marco Rubio for the Republican presidential nomination.
Making things even better, the Tribune refused to endorse either candidate in the Democratic primary, noting that they are far away from understanding the economic realities our country faces. 
We'd have to agree!
Illinois, remember to vote for Marco on March 15th!
