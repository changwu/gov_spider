In his closing remarks, which many people said they enjoyed, Christie said Iowans should caucus for the candidate who will best serve to aid military members coming back from conflicts.

"I enjoy every time I listen to him," Stewart said.
Stewart questioned him on a state policy detail, which led to her saying New Jersey has little sunshine to tap for solar energy.
