    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of New York and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a severe winter storm during the period of December 11-31, 2008.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storm in the counties of Albany, Columbia, Delaware, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, and Washington.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
Marianne C. Jackson has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
