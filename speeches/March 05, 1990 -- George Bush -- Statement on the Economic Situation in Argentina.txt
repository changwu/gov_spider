    The actions announced yesterday by Argentina's President Carlos Menem indicate that he clearly is determined to bring about economic recovery in Argentina. President Menem called me last Thursday, March 1, to tell me that he would be announcing new economic measures designed to bring stability to his country's economy. The United States encourages him in this effort and in his support for democracy. We realize, however, that this process is not easy and respect the efforts that President Menem is making. We will be studying closely the reforms he has announced, and will look for ways to continue helping the Argentine people to achieve economic recovery and prosperity.
