    South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis made the following statement following tonight's debate in Spartanburg, South Carolina:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by articulating a strategy to ensure that the 21st century is an American century. Unlike President Obama, Mitt Romney will conduct a foreign policy that acknowledges America's exceptional role in the world, and he will do so with clarity and resolve. In a Romney administration, our friends will never question where we stand â€“ and neither will our adversaries."
