    DES MOINES â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Thursday launched a new television ad featuring scenes of volunteers and supporters working together across Iowa.
WATCH: "Transform This Country"
The ad features remarks from Sen. Sanders' rally in October with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and over 25,000 supporters. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will hold events together in Iowa this weekend, including rallies in Ames on Saturday night and Sioux City on Sunday night.
"Transform This Country" is Sanders' 11th ad to run in Iowa, following "Fights For Us," "Hope," "Iowa First," "Belongs To Us," "Big Us," "For All," "Billionaires," "Patients Before Profits," "Strive" and "Our Side." All eleven ads have been produced entirely in-house by Bernie 2020 staff.
The full ad can be seen here and the transcript is below:
Take a look around you and find someone you don't know.
Maybe somebody doesn't look kinda like you.
Are you willing to fight for that person as much as you're willing to fight for yourself?
If you and millions of others are prepared to do that, not only will we win this election, but together, we will transform this country.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
