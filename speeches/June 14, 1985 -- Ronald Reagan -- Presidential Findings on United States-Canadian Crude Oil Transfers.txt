    On March 18, 1985, at the Quebec Summit, I joined Prime Minister Mulroney in endorsing a Trade Declaration with the objective of liberalizing energy trade, including crude oil, between the United States and Canada. Both Governments recognized the substantial benefits that would ensue from broadened crude oil transfers and exchanges between these two historic trading partners and allies. These benefits would include the increased availability of reliable energy sources, economic efficiencies, and material enhancements to the energy security of both countries. Following this Declaration, Canada declared that it would permit Canadian crude oil to be freely exported to the United States effective June 1, 1985.
Before crude oil exports to Canada can be authorized, I must make certain findings and determinations under statutes that restrict exports of crude oil. I have decided to make the necessary findings and determinations under the following statutes: Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212); section 28 of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 (30 U.S.C. 185); and section 28 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1354) (crude oil transported over the Trans-Alaska Pipeline or derived from the Naval Petroleum Reserves is excluded).
I hereby find and determine that exports of crude oil under these statutes are in the U.S. national interest, and I further find and determine that such U.S. crude oil exports to Canada-
• will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United States;
• will not increase reliance on imported off;
• are in accord with provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979; and
• are consistent with the purposes of the. Energy policy and Conservation Act. Therefore, such domestic crude oil may be exported to Canada for consumption or use therein.
These findings and determinations shall be published in the Federal Register. I direct the Secretary of Commerce to take all other necessary and proper action to expeditiously implement this decision.
