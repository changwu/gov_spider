    By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and by section 1 of the act entitled "An Act To authorize the President of the United States to locate, construct, and operate railroads in the Territory of Alaska, and for other purposes", approved March 12, 1914 (38 Stat. 305), and by the act entitled "An Act Making appropriations for the Department of the Interior for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1937, and for other purposes", approved June 22, 1936 (Public No. 741, 74th Congress), authorizing the Alaska Railroad to operate and maintain "ocean-going or coastwise vessels by ownership, charter, or arrangement with other branches of the Government service, for the purpose of providing additional facilities for the transportation of freight passengers, or mail, when deemed necessary, for the benefit and development of industries and travel affecting territory tributary to the Alaskan Railroad", and in view of the fact that the present interruption to ocean-going and coastwise transportation to and from the Territory of Alaska has seriously interfered with the operation and maintenance of the Alaska Railroad and with the development of industries and travel affecting territory tributary to the Alaska Railroad by causing a shortage of food supplies and other necessary commodities in the Territory, the Alaska Railroad is hereby authorized and directed to make use of such oceangoing or coastwise vessels as may be made available to it by agreement or arrangement with other branches of the Government service, to charter oceangoing or coastwise vessels and to perform any and all acts necessary for the operation of such chartered or Government-owned vessels for transporting passengers and freight to and from the Territory, for the purpose of providing necessary transportation facilities during the present interruption of shipping.
The Alaska Railroad shall continue to engage in coastwise and ocean-going transportation as herein authorized for such period as the Secretary of the Interior may deem necessary.
It is further directed that present commercial passenger and freight charges shall be maintained by the Alaska Railroad in connection with its operation of this additional service.
