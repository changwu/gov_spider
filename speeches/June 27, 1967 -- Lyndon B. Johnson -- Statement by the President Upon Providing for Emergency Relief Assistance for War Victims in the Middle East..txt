    THE RECENT HOSTILITIES in the Middle East took their inevitable toll in human suffering. While we are urgently searching for a lasting settlement of the Middle East problem, we must bear in mind that the first humanitarian task and the first task of reconstruction is to bind up the wounds of conflict--to begin to find homes for the homeless, food for the hungry, and medical care for the sick and wounded.
The American people have always responded generously to human suffering anywhere in the world. In this humanitarian tradition, the United States will join with other nations in a special effort to provide emergency assistance in the Middle East now. I have directed the establishment of a reserve of $5 million from contingency funds, to meet urgent relief needs in the period immediately ahead. We will allocate these funds through a number of channels, in whatever ways best help the war victims and encourage contributions from others, including the countries within the area.
As a first step, I have directed that our Government participate in the appropriate United Nations emergency programs of food and medical relief. In addition, we are offering $100,000 to the American Red Cross for immediate use by the International Red Cross to assist all victims of the conflict.
The Secretary of State wall keep emergency needs under constant review and will cooperate fully with the intergovernmental and private organizations now at work.
I must emphasize that this is an emergency relief program. Even while we are joining in this effort to meet urgent needs, we must look toward a permanent and equitable solution for those who have been displaced by this and previous wars. It will not be enough simply to fall back on the relief arrangements of the past. There will be no peace for any party in the Middle East unless this problem is attacked with new energy by all, and certainly, primarily by those who are immediately concerned.
