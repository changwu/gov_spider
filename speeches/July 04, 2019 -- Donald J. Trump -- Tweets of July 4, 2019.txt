So important for our Country that the very simple and basic 'Are you a Citizen of the United States?' question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this even on the 4th of July!Retweets: 22365Favorites: 99722

....and advanced aircraft anywhere in the World. Perhaps even Aircraft One will do a low & loud sprint over the crowd. That will start at 6:00P.M. but be there early. Then at 9:00 P.M. a great (to put it mildly) fireworks display. I will speak on behalf of our great Country!Retweets: 4996Favorites: 23759

Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest & most disloyal men in Congress is 'quitting' the Party. No Collusion No Obstruction! Knew he couldn't get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!Retweets: 25722Favorites: 116119
