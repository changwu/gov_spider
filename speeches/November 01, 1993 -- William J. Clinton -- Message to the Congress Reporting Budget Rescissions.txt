    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 37 proposed rescissions of budget authority, totaling $1.9 billion.
These proposed rescissions affect programs of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, State, and Transportation, International Security Assistance programs, and programs of the Agency for International Development, the Army Corps of Engineers, the General Services Administration, the Small Business Administration, the State Justice Institute, and the United States Information Agency. The details of these proposed rescissions are set forth in the attached letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and in the accompanying report.
Concurrent with these proposals, I am transmitting to the Congress FY 1994 supplemental appropriations language requests that would remove a variety of restrictions that impede effective functioning of the government, including certain proposals outlined in the recommendations of the National Performance Review.
Together, the supplemental language requests and the rescission proposals would result in a total budget authority reduction of $2.0 billion. My Administration is committed to working closely with the Congress to produce legislation that will achieve this level of savings.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
