    PAGO PAGO — Today, Samoan Chief Fa'alagiga Nina Tua'au-Glaude announced her endorsement of Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg for President. Chief Tua'au-Glaude is a former delegate for President Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and a former employee of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
"I believe in Mike's message of change for the people of American Samoa — he has the experience and the vision to bring about the change we need – including staving off climate change, which will be devastating to our home," said Chief Tua'au-Glaude. "He has my family's vote, and my village. That's why I am committing my time and effort to electing Mike president of the United States. He will bring integrity and honor to the White House."
Mike Bloomberg 2020 American Samoa Senior Advisor Karen Green said, "Mike Bloomberg 2020 is taking every single voter and every single delegate seriously, which is why we are proud to have Chief Tua'au-Glaude's support and to have the largest ground game here in American Samoa before we caucus on Super Tuesday. Mike's history of getting things done, and particularly his record of accomplishment in combating climate change, is moving voters our way."
Alone among the Democratic candidates, Mike Bloomberg 2020 has dedicated an extensive on-the-island presence in American Samoa, including 7 full time staff. In addition to television ads, the campaign has been airing targeted radio ads, along with targeted digital and print ads across the islands. The campaign has engaged in an extensive voter registration drive ahead of the caucus on Super Tuesday, which will allocate 6 pledged delegates.
