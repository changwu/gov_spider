    Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Congressman Paul Ryan represents a bold choice for Vice President. At this time of continued economic uncertainty, Mitt Romney has clearly signaled the focus of his administration will be getting federal government spending and debt under control and putting Americans back to work. The contrast with the current administration will be clear. The Romney-Ryan team will be ready to begin turning things around on day one."
