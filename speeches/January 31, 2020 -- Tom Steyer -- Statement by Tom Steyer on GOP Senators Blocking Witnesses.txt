    (Dubuque, Iowa, January 31, 2020) â€” Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer released the following statement after the GOP Senate majority voted against calling witnesses in Donald Trump's impeachment trial:
"I'm disgusted. By refusing to call witnesses, the Republicans in the Senate have proven to the American public that they are cowards. Nearly every one of them is complicit to Donald Trump's crimes. This sham led by Mitch McConnell was a total farce that made a mockery of the Constitution. They have broken their oath of office and put Trump's political and financial interests ahead of the American people."
