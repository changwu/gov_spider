    It is with a deep sense of personal sadness that I received your letter this afternoon. I will of course ensure that the Department of Defense accommodates your wishes.
I will always remember Larry for his friendship and for his service to his community and our country. And I will never forget Larry's remarkable success as a businessman, his generosity as a philanthropist and his skill as a diplomat.
I know this has been a difficult time for you and I sincerely hope that you find peace in the days ahead.
