    As the people of Florida and the Southeast and others prepare for and deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, Hillary Clinton released the following statement:
"My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of Hurricane Matthew, and my heart is broken for the victims and their families in Haiti, Cuba, the Caribbean, and Florida.
"This is a serious storm, and it has already caused serious damage. If you get an evacuation order, please follow it immediately. Bring any important documents, medicines, and your pets with you. Listen carefully to instructions from local and national officials. And if you're not sure what to do, please visit ready.gov for tips on staying safe.
"To all our local campaign staff, volunteers, and supporters: Please take care of yourselves and your neighbors – nothing is more important than that. To our extraordinary first responders and everyone working to prepare for and respond to the storm: We're so grateful for your courage and sacrifice, especially in times like these.
"And to the people of Florida and the Southeast, and everyone in the eye of the storm: Stay safe, and know that America is with you. In times of disaster, we pull together. We'll have your back every step of the way – today, and in the weeks and months to come."
