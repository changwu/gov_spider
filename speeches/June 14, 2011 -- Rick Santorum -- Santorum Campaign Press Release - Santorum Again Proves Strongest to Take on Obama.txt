    Manchester, NH - On questions ranging from the economy to social issues and spending to foreign policy, former Senator Rick Santorum demonstrated an understanding and strong ability to communicate solutions to address our country's challenges.
"While some on the stage tonight preferred to give one-sentence applause lines, Senator Santorum concentrated on giving direct, honest answers that offered not just criticisms of the current administration but real solutions to address our nation's most serious challenges. Now more than ever, Americans are looking for a president with the courage to call it like it is and the candor to give honest and forthright answers about how best to solve our nation's problems," said John Brabender, senior advisor to Senator Santorum. "Senator Santorum stood firm in his strong support of Chairman Ryan's budget plan, and he spoke plainly and clearly about the failures of the Obama administration when it comes to foreign policy. Rick Santorum continues to demonstrate - whether it be in debates, interviews or townhall meetings - that he has the depth of knowledge on the issues that challenge our country and the willingness to speak candidly with the American people about what needs to be done to return our country back on a path to prosperity."
