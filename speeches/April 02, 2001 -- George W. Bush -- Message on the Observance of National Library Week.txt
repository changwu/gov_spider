    I am pleased to join my fellow Americans in observing National Library Week.
An educated citizenry provides the foundation for a free and democratic society. Libraries promote the sharing of knowledge, connecting people of all ages with valuable information resources. These dynamic and modern institutions, and the librarians who staff them, add immeasurably to our quality of life.
Libraries serve as important centers for collecting, storing, and organizing information. Each year, more than 100,000 books are published in the United States alone, and the U.S. government publishes as many documents. Even beyond these numbers are incredible volumes of newspapers, magazines, and other copyrighted material.
In public, government, professional, or academic facilities, librarians help individuals use numerous resources to complete the simplest or most complex of researchrelated tasks. This ability to search for information from the oldest manuscripts to the latest references available demonstrates the enduring versatility of libraries.
During this special observance, I commend librarians for their contributions to education and learning throughout our Nation. I also encourage all Americans to visit their neighborhood library. Laura and I send our best wishes to the staff, volunteers, and patrons of libraries across America.
