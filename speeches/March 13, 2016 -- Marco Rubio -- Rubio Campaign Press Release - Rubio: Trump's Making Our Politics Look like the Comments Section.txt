    Marco: Donald Trump, Here's What Leadership Means
 
March 13, 2016
This morning, Marco continued to call out Donald Trump's dangerous rhetoric and manipulation of Americans' legitimate anger.

Here's what he had to say about Trump's warped idea of leadership:
I know people are angry.  I know people are frustrated.  But leadership is not about making people even angrier and even more frustrated and asking them to give you power so you can go after another group that you want to blame for people's anger and frustration.
Real leadership is recognizing people are angry, recognizing people are frustrated, and then showing them a way forward that gives them hope and a belief that we can make things better. That's real leadership.
It's "getting harder and harder to imagine" for Marco to support Trump as our nominee, too, he said. 
But that's a much less important question than whether or not the millions of conservatives and Republicans disturbed by Trump will be willing to support him in the fall.
The key takeaway from Marco:
If I'm our nominee, no one's going to be asked, will you support the nominee if they're President? If I'm our nominee, we'll unite the party, we'll grow it, and we'll win.
