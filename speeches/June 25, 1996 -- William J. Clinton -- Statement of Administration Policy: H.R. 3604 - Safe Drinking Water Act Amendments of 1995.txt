    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Bliley (R) and 40 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3604 as reported by the House Commerce Committee. Ensuring the safety of the Nation's drinking water is one of the Administration's top environmental priorities.
H.R. 3604, which is the result of a bipartisan effort, reflects the Administration's recommendations for strengthening public health protections by: (1) establishing a State Revolving Fund (SRF) to subsidize community efforts to improve drinking water safety; (2) providing a flexible framework to promote the protection of drinking water sources;(3) providing responsible regulatory reforms including the appropriate use of cost-benefit analysis in standards setting; and (4) strengthening State programs for improving the capability of water systems to provide safe water. These provisions coupled with the bill's improved consumer awareness provisions will help meet the challenge of providing safe and affordable drinking water.
The Administration, however, strongly opposes the provisions added/in Title V which jeopardize public health and undermine the SRF by limiting the States' flexibility to prioritize project funding. Furthermore, the Administration recommends that H.R. 3604 be modified in conference to minimize the number of earmarks on State Revolving Funds. The bill's current level of Fund set-asides for designated activities would limit the availability of funds needed for a permanent revolving fund. The Administration may also propose several technical corrections in conference.
