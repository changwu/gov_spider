He took one question about whether he would go after Exxon's profits.
He said there are more than "9,000 permits for drilling," adding that the oil companies "are not drilling."
"Why don't they drill more? Because they make more money not producing oil. Prices go up on the one hand. No. 2 the reason they are not drilling is they are buying back their own stock, should be taxed quite frankly. Buying back their own stock and not making new investments."

Out of Town Pool Report #11 —-Passing along from White House
Per White House
Today, at the Port of Los Angeles, President Biden met with Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka and Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero.
The President knows that one of the key ways to fight inflation is by lowering the cost of moving goods through supply chains, which is why the Administration's Supply Chains Disruptions Task Force has focused on decongesting the nation's busiest ports due to disruptions caused by the pandemic. Today there are about 40% fewer containers clogging the docks for long periods than last November.

Travel Pool Report -#20 Family Photo
The family photo ended at 2:15 POTUS responded to two questions shouted by a reporter.
Q1: Are you confident the summit went well?
"I'm always confident," POTUS said
Q2: How did your talks with world leaders go?
"You'll have to ask them. Let's just take the picture."
POTUS chatted with a few world leaders as they exited the stage. It was a group of leaders walking with POTUS so it was hard to see which leaders he was addressing.

Pool Report 21 —- Working luncheon
Pool was ushered until working luncheon at 2:27.
A grey-haired, bearded man who the pool was unable to identity spoke to POTUS about the value of a working lunch.
Your pooler (and the rest of the pool) are working to identity him. He was the only one there without a plaquard.
Touting the value of a working lunch he said. It gives the "benefit of sharing thoughts and ideas."
He said it would give the leaders a chance to have "an open conversation" without staff present.



June 10, 202214:52 PDT

In Town Pool Report #21 -- Man identified
The introducer who spoke at the luncheon was former U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, who is serving as President Biden's special advisor to the Summit of Americas.
He is now sporting a beard, which makes him look different than he did when he was in the Senate.



June 10, 202215:03 PDT

Out of Town Pool Report — Numbering correction
The last pool report was labeled #21, when it should have been #22. The next one will be #23, which corrects the numbers.

Out of town Pool Report #23 -- Quotes from senior administration official
From a senior administration official on the migration declaration
"From the beginning we really wanted this to be very ambitious, forward learning, something that would truly have an impact. And so we wanted to make sure countries that signed on were really committed to this and we would welcome any other countries that wanted to join, but we first engaged countries that we know have been truly impacted by these historic flows"
"And I think what we found is that we were starting to build consensus. I think more and more countries started to see that oh you know this could actually be in their benefit to join this idea of responsibility sharing, all the countries coming together."
"The first pillar that — you've now seen the text — really focus on stabilizing, stability and supporting countries on the front lines that have really truly been impacted and hosting large refugee and migrant populations. I think a kind of light bulb has gone off that, ok, we signed on to this, we will potentially, you know, receive more support from the international community. So I think that is why we saw a sort of pile on at the end, a recognition that this is a good thing."
"So we have have been really pleased"
More quotes to come



June 10, 202215:40 PDT

Out of town Pool Report #24 — More quotes
Attributed to a senior administrator official on migration declaration.
" We're putting a lot of skin in the game, some of it is an expansion of things that we're already doing to support countries and, you know, we are the biggest donor in the Western Hemisphere when it comes to refugee and migration response.."
" We announced an additional 300 million today in in that funding from the State Department and USAID ID one of the other concrete deliverables that we made, and this is new is our interest in working with the World Bank, the Inter American Development Bank, to provide more support to these middle income countries that have been most impacted with the with this, concessional financing, going to not just the refugee and migrant populations."
"One area that I think is we need to really focus on and I know the President feels this way too is our some of our economies are recovering and we have jobs that we can fill. And we know that unemployment is a major driver of migration, how can we do more to match the workers with the jobs and so I think it's really interesting to see Mexico step forward and say that they're going to expand and set up new temporary worker programs. That's that's really exciting. I think we've been seeing Mexico increasingly be the leader in the region on these issues."
" Honestly, I think there's even beyond what you saw in the back sheet. There's opportunities for mobility with education opportunities, you know, I think there's so many different kinds of legal migration pathways that we need to turn on. Some of them even just sort of the traditional immigrant visa processing, a lot of that was turned off worldwide during COVID So and I think when there's a lack of opportunities for people to migrate legally, that's when you see an increase in irregular migration."

Pool is rolling at 4:07. We are on our way to the first of two DNC fundraisers on POTUS's schedule tonight.

Out of Town Pool Report #26 —- Arrival
The pool van arrived at fundraiser at 4:31. It is at a private residence in a very tony neighborhood.
We are in the Brentwood section of LA.
Your pooler did not see POTUS exit the vehicle it go into residence.
Along the way, many drivers got out of their cars held up on blocked freeway on ramps to take photos and videos of the motorcade, cheering and waving. Some even stood on concrete barriers separating the highway and exit ramps.
One woman flashed impassioned middle fingers, using both her hands to let the motorcade know how she feels.
