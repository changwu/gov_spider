    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist bombing in Eilat today, which resulted in the death of at least three civilians. Our condolences go out to the victims, their families, and the people of Israel. We also condemn those Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, that condone these barbaric actions.
The burden of responsibility for preventing terrorist attacks rests with the Palestinian Authority government. Failure to act against terror will inevitably affect relations between that government and the international community and undermine the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own.
