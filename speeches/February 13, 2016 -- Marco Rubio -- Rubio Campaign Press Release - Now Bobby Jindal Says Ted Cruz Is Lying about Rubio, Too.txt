Now, former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal is calling out Cruz, too.Â Here's what he had to say:
Yesterday, Ted Cruz stood in front of hundreds of pro-life Christians and lied about Marco Rubio. Marco has always been passionately committed to the pro-life cause and has repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Instead of working to unite conservatives to defund Planned Parenthood, Cruz is using the issue as a political weapon. I expect Democrats like Hillary Clinton to falsely attack conservatives over the sanctity of life, but I expected more from Ted Cruz.
Governor Jindal's right: The life issue, which transcends politics, should never be used as a political weapon.

Jindal has a strong pro-life record of his own: He passed successful commonsense measures to cut the number of abortions in Louisiana.
