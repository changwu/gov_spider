On Monday, Bonior will travel to Las Vegas and remain there through the caucus.
The campaign will also be holding a statewide canvass with supporters from Nevada and across the region, including many union members who have been working with the campaign for months as part Edwards' large bloc of labor support. Canvassers will spend Saturday and Sunday going door-to-door delivering targeted messages to Nevada caucus goers on the issues that concern them the most.

On Sunday night she will attend a house party with Edwards' supporters and precinct captains. She will remain in Las Vegas for several days next week.
Edwards has strong grassroots support in Nevada due to his leadership on the issues, particularly health care, Iraq, working families and energy. His organization was recently bolstered by staff from Iowa who came to Nevada following their work on Edwards' strong second place showing over Hillary Clinton. He has deep support from labor. The campaign has been working closely with the Carpenters, Steelworkers, Transport Workers and Communication Workers for months. Political leaders who support Edwards have been hard at work making phone calls and knocking on doors to spread his message of building One America.
Polls consistently show Edwards is the most electable Democratic against any of the top Republicans and is the only Democrat in the race to ever win in a "red" state.
