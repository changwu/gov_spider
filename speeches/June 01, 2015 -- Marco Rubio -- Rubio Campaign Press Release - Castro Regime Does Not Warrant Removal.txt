Last week, in the latest of a succession of one-way concessions to the Castro Regime, President Obama removed Cuba from the US State Sponsors of Terrorism List.
Here's Marco's response to the news, as reported in the Tampa Bay Times,

"President Obama and his administration continue to give the Cuban regime concession after concession, in exchange for nothing that even remotely resembles progress towards freedom and democracy for the Cuban people, or assurances that the regime will discontinue working against America's national security interests."
Cuba has done little to warrant its removal from the State Department's list and too many questions remain about safety and security under the Castro regime.
