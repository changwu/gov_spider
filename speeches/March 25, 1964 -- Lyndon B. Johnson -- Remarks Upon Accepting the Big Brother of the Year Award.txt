    I don't know of any award that cheers and encourages me more than this Big Brother Award. To help a boy find his way--to give his life purpose and meaning--is as noble an enterprise as any man could join.
Yesterday I spoke to a group here in Washington and told them that America's purpose was to offer an outstretched arm that tries to help, instead of an arm-length sword that helps to kill.
As a matter of fact, the aims of the Big Brother movement and the hopes of this Nation in its relationships with young, emerging nations in this world are much the same.
America's selfless purpose around the world is to try to help other nations find in their future the same kind of inspiration that was born in a struggling young republic 175 years ago.
Our war on poverty is a Big Brother movement--to try to reach out to those who are sunk deep in misery and deprivation and say to them, "Here, let me take you by the hand and help you help yourself. Let us try to help you find brightness where now there is none. Let us revive in your heart the hope that once was there but is now gone."
So, I accept this Big Brother Award not personally but as a symbol of what this unselfish, generous Nation is trying to do-here at home and around the world.
May God bless each of you and the efforts that you are making in this most worthy Cause.
