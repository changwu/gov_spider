    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Danforth (R) Missouri and 3 others)
The Administration opposes Senate passage of S. 863 unless it is amended to delete section 202 (Drunk Driving Incentive Grants) of Title II, Title III (Automobile Crashworthiness) and Title IV (Gray Market Automobiles). However, with respect to the crashworthiness ratings required by Title III, the Administration would not object to a requirement for a study of such ratings with recommendations to the Congress for further administrative or legislative action if determined necessary.
