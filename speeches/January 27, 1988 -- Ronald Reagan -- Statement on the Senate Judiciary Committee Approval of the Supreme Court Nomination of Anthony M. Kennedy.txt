    The Senate Judiciary Committee's 14-0 vote to approve the nomination of Judge Anthony Kennedy gives us considerable confidence that the Nation will soon have a full Court. The committee has acted responsibly and expeditiously to review his qualifications and favorably report Judge Kennedy to the full Senate. I look forward to a positive vote soon by the Senate that will bring this distinguished and scholarly legal mind to the Court. I am very pleased by the committee action.
