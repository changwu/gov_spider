    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate, the Treaty between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada on Pacific Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
This Treaty is necessary to resolve difficulties which have arisen between the United States and Canada concerning albacore tuna fishing on the Pacific Coast. In the past Canada has seized vessels of the United States fishing albacore tuna off the Canadian coast, and the United States has retaliated by prohibiting the import of tuna from Canada.
The Treaty solves these problems by securing free and unlimited access for vessels of both countries off the Pacific coasts of the United States and Canada. It provides reciprocal port access and rights to land tuna in specified ports. The Treaty will also assure that circumstances will not arise which would lead to Canadian seizures of American vessels in the albacore tuna fishery or require another United States embargo of Canadian tuna. This approach was suggested by and has the support of the United States albacore fishing industry.
Not only will this Treaty benefit the fishing industries of both countries, but it represents important progress in the resolution of the fisheries issues which have been troubling the United States and Canada.
I recommend that the Senate give early consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
