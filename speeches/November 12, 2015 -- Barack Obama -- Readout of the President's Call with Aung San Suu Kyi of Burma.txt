    President Obama spoke last night by phone with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to congratulate her on her campaign and the success of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in Burma's historic parliamentary election that was held on November 8, 2015. The President commended her for her tireless efforts and sacrifice over so many years to promote a more inclusive, peaceful, and democratic Burma. The two leaders discussed the importance for all parties to respect the official results once announced and to work together in the spirit of unity to form an inclusive, representative government that reflects the will of the people. The President noted that the election and formation of a new government could be an important step forward in Burma's democratic transition and the effort to forge a more peaceful and prosperous future.
