    Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Congressman C.W. "Bill" Young. For over 50 years Bill served the people of Florida, both in the State legislature and as the longest serving Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives. He will be remembered for his advocacy and support for the Armed Forces, servicemembers, and their families as well as his statesmanship and long history of working across the aisle to keep our country moving forward.
