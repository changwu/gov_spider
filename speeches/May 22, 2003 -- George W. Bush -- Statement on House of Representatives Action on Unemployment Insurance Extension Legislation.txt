    I commend the House of Representatives for passing an unemployment insurance extension that will continue important additional assistance for American workers as our economy recovers. Combined with action on the jobs-and-growth package, Congress has taken important steps to help America's unemployed workers. I also urge Congress to pass legislation to create the innovative Re-employment Accounts I proposed to give certain unemployed individuals additional benefits and incentives to find work. I look forward to signing these measures into law.
