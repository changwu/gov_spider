    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsors: Whitten (D), Mississippi; Dixon (D), California)
The purpose of this Statement of Administration Policy is to provide the Administration's views on H.R. 3291, the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, FY 1992. The Administration urges the House of Representatives to approve H.R. 3291 in its current form.
The President vetoed an earlier version of this bill (H.R. 2699) because it did not include language that would prohibit the use of Congressionally appropriated local funds to finance abortions except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. H.R. 3291 does include such language, the same language that was included in the District of Columbia Appropriations Acts for FY 1989, FY 1990, and FY 1991.
On the basis of OMB's initial scoring, the Administration finds that the bill is within the House 602(b) allocation. In aggregate, the House 602(b) allocations are consistent with the statutory spending limits enacted in the Budget Enforcement Act.
