    The Undeniable Success Of The 2002 Winter Games Has Been Noted On Both Sides Of The Political Aisle:
In April 2002, Congress Unanimously Passed A Resolution Declaring The Salt Lake Olympics The "Most Successful Olympic Winter Games Ever Held." "Whereas the State of Utah hosted the world during the largest and most successful Olympic Winter Games ever held; Whereas the people of Utah opened their hearts and their homes to the athletes of the world and represented the Nation well to the world community;..." (H.Res.363, Introduced 3/7/02)

The Resolution Praised Governor Romney's Work, Saying He And Other Leaders "Did A Spectacular Job." "Whereas the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, its president, Mitt Romney, and its chairman, Robert Garff did a spectacular job in staging a great Winter Olympics with class, dignity, and a proper focus on the athletic competition;..." (H.Res.363, Introduced 3/7/02)



    The Resolution Passed 425-0. (H.Res.363, Roll Call Vote #84, 425-0, 4/10/02)
  

Utah's Democratic Party Chairman: Romney "Did A Commendable Job" Leading The Olympics. "[Utah] Democratic Party Chairman Jim Dabakis said Utah's minority party has 'no gripe with Mitt Romney's handling of the Olympics. He did a commendable job. I don't think it's useful for the Utah Democratic Party to say anything other than the truth.'" (Deseret News, 2/18/12)
White House Olympics Task Force Chair Thurgood Marshall Jr. And Olympics Committee Representative Stephen Bull Praised Romney's Leadership:
Thurgood Marshall Jr. And Stephen Bull: "Romney's Skill, Energy Made Salt Lake Games A Success." (Thurgood Marshall Jr. and Stephen B. Bull, Op-Ed, "Romney's Skill, Energy Made Salt Lake Games A Success," Tampa Bay Times, 1/27/12)
Marshall And Bull: Romney "Deserves Immense Credit" For The Games' Success. "Romney met all of these challenges with relentless skill and energy, and he deserves immense credit for what was declared to be the most successful Olympic Winter Games ever." (Thurgood Marshall Jr. and Stephen B. Bull, Op-Ed, "Romney's Skill, Energy Made Salt Lake Games A Success," Tampa Bay Times, 1/27/12)
Marshall And Bull: Political Criticism Of Governor Romney's Olympics Leadership "Misses The Mark." "Recent criticism of Mitt Romney's leadership of the Salt Lake effort by political opponents misses the mark. It overlooks the unprecedented challenges that he overcame and the significant risk that he faced. We saw that on a daily basis." (Thurgood Marshall Jr. and Stephen B. Bull, Op-Ed, "Romney's Skill, Energy Made Salt Lake Games A Success," Tampa Bay Times, 1/27/12)
