    Today, on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, I am transmitting to the Senate for its advice and consent an amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Preservation of the ozone layer is critical to life on Earth. The Montreal Protocol has led to a dramatic reduction in the production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals, and scientists report that the ozone layer is on its way to recovery. The amendment I transmit today builds on this progress, in part by strengthening measures to promote compliance with the protocol. I urge the Senate to approve this amendment.
It also is critical that the United States support efforts by developing countries to phase out their use of ozone-depleting chemicals. Regrettably, appropriations measures now before Congress would deny funds I have requested for the Montreal Protocol Fund, which has a long record of success in these efforts. I call on Congress to approve the funds needed to help preserve the Earth's protective ozone layer.
