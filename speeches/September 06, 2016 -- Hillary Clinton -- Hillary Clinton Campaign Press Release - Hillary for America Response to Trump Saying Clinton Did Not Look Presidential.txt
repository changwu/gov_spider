    In response to Donald Trump's repeated claim that Hillary Clinton does not look presidential, HFA Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds offered the following statement:
"This isn't the first time Donald Trump has had a problem looking at someone different from himself and actually seeing them. He questioned whether a distinguished judge could do his job because of his Mexican heritage. He looked at a mourning Gold Star mother and he made assumptions about her silence in grief. He looked at an accomplished anchor and suggested she was a "bimbo." And he looked at a sitting president and said he wasn't American. So it's not surprising that Donald Trump doesn't think Hillary Clinton looks presidential. This cycle, voters know all too well what's not presidential: Donald Trump and his narrow views and divisive rhetoric."
TRUMP LAUNCHED A SERIES OF RACIALLY TINGED ATTACKS ON A FEDERAL JUDGE, SAYING HE COULD NOT DO HIS JOB BECAUSE HE WAS OF MEXICAN HERITAGE
Trump: "He's A Mexican. We're Building A Wall Between Here And Mexico… He Is Giving Us Very Unfair Rulings, Rulings That People Can't Even Believe." TRUMP: Do you know that these people went to every attorney general practically in the country that they could and did you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general from Texas to Florida, to many other states?
TAPPER: Is it not – when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack, and you reject that – if you're saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?
TRUMP: No. I don't think so at all.
TAPPER: No?
TRUMP: No. He's proud of his heritage. I respect him for that.
TAPPER: But you're saying you can't do his job because of that.
TRUMP: Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK? I'm building a wall. Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics
TAPPER: He's a legal citizen – TRUMP: Do you know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they are going to get jobs right now. They are going to get jobs. I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we are building a wall. He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe. This case should have ended years ago in summary judgment. The best lawyers I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said, this is not a case. This is a case that should have ended. [CNN, The Lead, 6/3/16]

USA Today: Trump "Was Perhaps The Most Prominent Voice Of The 'Birther' Movement." "Trump has been an outspoken critic of President Obama and was perhaps the most prominent voice of the 'birther' movement, which asserted, erroneously, that Obama was not a natural-born U.S. citizen. On Monday, he took a shot at the newest entrant to the 2016 Republican field, Jeb Bush, tweeting: 'Do we really need another Bush in the White House — we have had enough of them.' If there's one thing Trump brings to the 2016 campaign, it's confidence.

She Doesn't Even Look Presidential To Me." TRUMP: "Beyond that, she's pledged to add another executive amnesty in violation of both congressional law and the United States constitution. These actions from Hillary Clinton will trigger a crises greater than almost anything we've seen. This will be a constitutional crisis like we haven't seen in our country. In effect, she's pledging to abolish the law making powers of congress and assume the powers of an imperial leader. She's not an imperial leader, is she? I don't think so.

Honestly, who do you think China would be more concerned in a negotiation with? Trump or Hillary?" [Trump Campaign Rally, Fort Lauderdale FL, 8/10/16]
