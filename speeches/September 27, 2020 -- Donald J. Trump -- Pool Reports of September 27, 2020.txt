 In-town pool report #4: Trump national golf club 
?The motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf club at 10:08 after an uneventful ride. There was a gathering of both pro and anti Trump signs and protesters outside the clubâ€” pool saw both Biden and Trump 2020 signs, a couple signs noting the 200k coronavirus death count, and one person dressed in a red Handmaid's Tale costume holding a sign that said "vote."
Pool did not see POTUS. Press now headed to the offsite location where we will wait.

 In-town pool report #5: heading back to White House 
?Motorcade is rolling at 1:58 back to the White House from the Trump National golf club. Pool did not see POTUS.
There is still a cluster of protesters outside the club, both pro and anti Trump. One sign read "GOP senators are hypocrites." Another person was laying out small fake gravestones along the side of the road with a sign that said "he knew." Another sign said "Epic failure democracy killer." There were also pro-Trump flags and 3 Jeeps drove back and forth on the road with Trump campaign flags waving from the back. Dueling chants of "vote him out" and "four more years" broke out among the assembled group. The chants intensified when the motorcade began rolling. There were about 20 protesters on one side of the street; pool didn't have visibility to count on the other side, but it was a roughly similar amount.
