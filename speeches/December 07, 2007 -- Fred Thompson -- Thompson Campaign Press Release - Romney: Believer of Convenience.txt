"Mitt Romney's latest ad, "Not Politically Correct," may have some people wondering if the TV spot is strategically correct because it outlines positions that may renew charges of flip-flopping. (New York Times, 12/07/07)

Mr. Romney has said repeatedly during this election cycle that his position evolved. He's also been criticized for his past record supporting gay rights. (New York Times, 12/07/07)
