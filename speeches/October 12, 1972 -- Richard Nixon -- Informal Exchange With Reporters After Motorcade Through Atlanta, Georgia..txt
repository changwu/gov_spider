    WELL, I have seen some pretty big crowds before, but this was the biggest one we have had. It was very warm, very friendly, as Atlanta crowds always are, and I will have more to say in a few minutes upstairs and you are welcome to cover it.
Q. Does this make you want to go back on the trail more?
THE PRESIDENT. This thing, of course, is enjoyable, the opportunity to see the people in the rest of the country, and I will do as much as I can between now and the election, but I have to be President first.
Q. Will this be your only trip to the South or have you decided yet?
THE PRESIDENT. No, but we are coming to the South because we consider it part of the country. The idea of dividing the North and the South, as I will say later, is now, as this election will demonstrate, over forever.
Q. Mr. President, how many more days do you think you will be campaigning?
THE PRESIDENT. It will have to depend on how much business we have in the Congress. We will determine that in the next week.
