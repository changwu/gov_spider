    On behalf of the American people, I extend condolences to the people of Algeria for the terrible losses caused by yesterday's earthquake. I was deeply saddened to learn of the hundreds of deaths, the many injuries, and the major damage in towns east of Algiers and in the capital city. Our prayers are for the victims, their families, and the entire Algerian nation. The United States stands ready to help.
