    Small And Mid-Sized Business Owners Taking Advantage Of Economic Growth Package Investment Incentives
Today, President Bush met with small and mid-sized business owners to discuss temporary tax incentives in the economic growth package. In February 2008, President Bush signed into law an economic growth package that will boost our economy by putting money back into the hands of American workers and businesses. This growth package meets the criteria the President laid out in January â€“ it amounts to more than $152 billion, or about one percent of GDP, provides tax rebates to more than 130 million American households, and offers temporary tax incentives for businesses to invest in their companies and create jobs this year. These incentives are already in place and are starting to have an impact. The growth package was carefully calibrated and is large enough to promote short-run growth in our economy without jeopardizing our long-term budget objectives.
Today's Meeting Participants Were Prompted To Make New Investments This Year As A Result Of The Economic Growth Package

Dan Glier is the President of Glier's Meats, Inc., an 18-employee, USDA-inspected meat processing plant located in Covington, Kentucky. Established in 1946 by Glier's father, Glier's Meats is a manufacturer of many types of gourmet meats but is most renowned for their specialty product, Goetta. Holding in excess of 90 percent of the Goetta market, Glier's annual production of Goetta now exceeds over 1,000,000 pounds. Earlier this year, Glier installed a new replacement refrigeration compressor for approximately $15,000. When the stimulus package passed, he additionally began planning to install a deer processing facility, an investment he would not have made without the incentives in the stimulus legislation.
Tony Jimenez is the President and CEO of MicroTechnologies, LLC, a small Northern Virginia business focused on information technology and systems engineering. Since founding MicroTechnologies in 2004, Jimenez has led the company through a period of uninterrupted growth. MicroTechnologies' professional staff, now numbering more than 100, supports more than 30 prime contracts with civilian and defense agencies. Jimenez says that the savings from the stimulus package will allow him to move his company into a new rented space. He will also be spending $500,000 to $600,000 on new servers, technology upgrades, a phone system, copiers, furniture, and lease-hold improvements to the new space. He estimates the tax provisions will save him around $60,000 on his new investments, and he would not have been able to make this move without those savings.

In response to the stimulus package, Sawner has already spent $70,000 on new phones, furniture, and office equipment for new buildings in Virginia and Arizona, and he plans to spend another $100,000 on computers and servers and office equipment.
