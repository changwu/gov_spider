    Mitt Romney today announced the support of 10 additional New Hampshire State Representatives. With today's endorsements, Governor Romney now has the support of 58 New Hampshire State Representatives, 9 State Senators, 4 out of 5 Executive Councilors and 7 out of 10 Sheriffs.
"I am honored to have earned the support of these fiscally responsible New Hampshire State Legislators. Their endorsements show that our campaign is continuing to gain momentum in the final weeks before the primary," said Mitt Romney.
"Governor Romney has the executive experience and skills that are needed to defeat President Obama and turn around our economy. He is clearly the strongest Republican candidate and the most qualified person to lead our party in 2012," said Deputy Majority Leader Shawn Jasper. "Mitt is running the type of traditional New Hampshire campaign that Granite Staters expect from presidential candidates. He is taking nothing for granted and working hard to earn every vote. I am proud to support Governor Romney and his campaign to cut spending, lower taxes and create jobs."
