    THANK YOU very much, Mr. President.
I am sitting here in the White House with the Vice President and your distinguished Ambassador to our country, the Assistant Secretary of State, and the Chairman of our Communications Commission.
It is a great pleasure to exchange views with you through this medium. The underseas cable to Venezuela dramatizes, I think, the great community of interest between North and South America in general and certainly between the United States and your country in particular.
Moreover, it represents a very important step forward in improving global communications which have made rapid advances in the last few years. For years our two peoples have worked very closely together in political, and cultural, and economic pursuits.
We have added a new dimension to our endeavors now by undertaking the work of the Alliance for Progress.
In all of these enterprises we share an abiding concern for the freedom and the dignity of man, and our number one objective in the world is peace for all mankind.
So now as this cable opens a new era of improved communications between our countries, we can look forward to even closer friendships and associations between Americans and Venezuelans.
I offer my heartiest congratulations to you, Mr. President, and to all of your fine countrymen on this most significant occasion. I send you the best wishes of our Vice President and Secretary Gordon and I look forward to meeting you personally in the near future.
Thank you very much.
