    Urbandale, Iowa â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachamann has issued the following statement in response to the Obama Administration's court injunction against South Carolina to block enforcement of their immigration law:
"I support Governor Haley 100 percent in her efforts to enforce immigration laws in the state of South Carolina. The Obama Administration has failed miserably in achieving border security, so shame on them for taking legal action against states who have been forced to do the job for them. As president, I will secure the border and enforce existing immigration laws so our nations' Governors can focus on running their states. And I'll end magnets, like taxpayer benefits that entice illegals to come across the border."
