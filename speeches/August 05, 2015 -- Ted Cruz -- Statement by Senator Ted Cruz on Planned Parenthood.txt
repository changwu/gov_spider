    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to the Center for Medical Progress' latest video documenting Planned Parenthood's corrupt practices:
"With every new video released showing Planned Parenthood's degenerate business that benefits from the taking of innocent life, we are reminded that our fight to save and protect these lives is far from over. It pains me to see Planned Parenthood's corrupt practices carried out right in my hometown of Houston, but only furthers my resolve to continue efforts to both investigate these allegations, prosecute criminal wrongdoing, and defund the organization all together. No organization that profits from terminating innocent human life should receive one penny of taxpayer money and those who are engaging in these likely criminal activities must and will be held to account."
