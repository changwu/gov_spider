    I commend the Senate for acting quickly and in a bipartisan way to give law enforcement these essential, additional tools to combat terrorism and safeguard America against future terrorist attacks. This important legislation respects our Constitution while allowing us to treat terrorist acts the same as serious drug crimes and organized crime, and strengthens our ability to share information to disrupt, weaken, and eliminate global terrorist networks. We need these tools now. I am hopeful that I will be able to sign this legislation into law soon.
