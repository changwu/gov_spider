    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit to Congress a copy of the decree of the court of the United States for the southern district of New York, awarding the sum of $17,150.66 for the illegal capture of the British schooner Glen , and request that an appropriation of that amount may be made as an indemnification to the parties interested.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
