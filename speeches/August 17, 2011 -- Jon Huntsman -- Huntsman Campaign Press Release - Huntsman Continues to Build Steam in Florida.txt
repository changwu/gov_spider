Last week, Jon visited South Florida and accepted the endorsement of Jeb Bush, Jr. and Ana Navarro, who will lead the campaign's outreach to young voters and the Hispanic community, respectively.
On the heels of that visit, the Huntsman campaign today added two more key Florida supporters: State Senator Ellyn Bogdanoff, and Coral Gables Mayor and former U.S. Ambassador Jim Cason.
Sen. Bogdanoff, a small-business owner who has championed lower taxes and less regulation, lauded Jon for his economic record in Utah. "Due to the pro-growth policies he implemented as governor - including historic tax cuts - Utah led the nation in job creation," said Sen. Bogdanoff. "Floridians need jobs, and Gov. Huntsman is the candidate with the leadership and experience to deliver."
Mayor Cason, who served as Ambassador to Paraguay and in half-a-dozen other U.S. Embassies throughout Latin America and Europe, noted that Jon is the only candidate with both foreign policy experience (Ambassador to China & Singapore, and U.S. Trade Representative) and executive experience (Governor): "He is qualified to represent America's strength and ideals on the national and global stage, which is especially critical in these tumultuous times."
