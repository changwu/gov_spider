    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sen. Hawkins (R) Florida)
The Administration opposes S. 140 because: (1) States are already making significant progress in preventing child sexual abuse and the bill's proposed new categorical grant program is unnecessary and inappropriate; (2) S. 140's new burdensome requirements for States wishing to receive a grant would limit State flexibility to best address the problem; (3) it would establish two new unnecessary and duplicative categorical programs for respite care and crisis nurseries for certain children; (4) several existing Federal programs already fund child sexual abuse prevention, such as Child Abuse State grants, Child Welfare Services, and the $2.6 billion Social Services Block Grant; and (5) the Administration's proposed Family Crisis and Protective Services legislation would allow States greater flexibility in addressing issues such as family violence and child sexual abuse.
