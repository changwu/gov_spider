  A Proclamation

Our Nation's fire fighters protect our lives, our families, and the economic life of our communities from the threat of fire. Many valiant fire fighters have given their lives, and all daily risk death or injury, to preserve the lives of others and to protect our property and resources from destruction.
Our more than 2 million professional and volunteer fire fighters make countless contributions and sacrifices for their fellow citizens. In 1984, these fire fighters responded to more than 2 million fires and more than 8 million non-fire emergencies. These brave Americans well deserve our gratitude and public recognition.
The Congress, by Public Law 99-343, has designated October 8, 1986, as "National Fire Fighters Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, October 8, 1986, as National Fire Fighters Day, and I urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

RONALD REAGAN
