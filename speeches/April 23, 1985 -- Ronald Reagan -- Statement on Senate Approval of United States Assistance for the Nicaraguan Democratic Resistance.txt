    Tonight the Senate east an historic vote for freedom and democracy in Central America. A clear majority has spoken in favor of a consistent and effective policy that is true both to our principles and to our interests.
To reach this result the White House and Senators of both parties worked together to find common agreement; and we now stand upon common ground. Support for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance is a crucial component of the proposal approved by the Senate. Our hemisphere will not be a safe place if the United States ceases to stand by its friends.
Today's vote will contribute toward bringing both peace and democracy close to the people of Nicaragua. That vote demonstrates that a direct bipartisan consensus on this critical issue remains possible. I urge Members of the House to lend their support.
