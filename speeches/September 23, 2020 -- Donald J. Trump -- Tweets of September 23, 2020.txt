I was honored to be back in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with thousands of loyal, hardworking American Patriots. This election is a choice between Pennsylvania & China. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Pennsylvania Wins, and AMERICA WINS! #MAGA https://t.co/GTSNoUDpHfRetweets: 14596Favorites: 60880

I hardly know Cindy McCain other than having put her on a Committee at her husband's request. Joe Biden was John McCain's lapdog. So many BAD decisions on Endless Wars & the V.A., which I brought from a horror show to HIGH APPROVAL. Never a fan of John. Cindy can have Sleepy Joe!Retweets: 28134Favorites: 134972
