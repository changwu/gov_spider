    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Howard (D) New Jersey and 3 others)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 4961 unless it is amended to:
— Authorize appropriations for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of $21.4 million, $21.7 million, and $22 million for fiscal years 1987-1989, respectively, instead of the $24 million, $25.4 million, and $27 million levels currently in the bill; and
— Credit NTSB receipts to the General Fund rather than the NTSB appropriations account, consistent with sound principles of budgetary control.
