    I note in this morning's newspaper that the charge that I misquoted you during the Friday night debate with Mr. Nixon. I said on that debate:

  Mr. Lodge on "Meet the Press" stated that if there ever was a question when we did not have the law on our side, it was in the U-2 incident.

Mr. Nixon at a press conference following your "Meet the Press" appearance commented that in a technical sense you were correct. The transcript of the "Meet the Press" interview shows the following question and answer:

  Mr. LINDLEY. But relative to the Soviet Union do you think we have as much prestige and as much influence in the world as we had 8 years ago?
Mr. LODGE. Let me just point to the U-2 case. You might say if ever there was a case where we didn't have the law on our side it was the U-2 case, and yet when the Soviet Union proceeded against us in the Security Council on the U-2 case they got the most dreadful defeat.

I believe the case is clear that I quoted you accurately and that your answer was not a paraphrase of the questioner. In the interest of fairness, I would very much appreciate your setting the record straight on this matter.
With every good wish.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
