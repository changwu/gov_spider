    "After four years of promises and disappointment, President Obama has unleashed a prairie fire of debt that the next generation will be forced to repay. Under the President's failed economic policies, every man, woman, and child owes an additional $16,000 and it will only increase if President Obama gets another four years in office. It's time for a change in leadership — and a new president who will stop passing our bills on to the next generation." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Four Years Ago Today, Candidate Obama Promised To Not Mortgage "Our Children's Future" On A "Mountain Of Debt":
Candidate Obama, Four Years Ago Today: "I Don't Want To See That ... Our Children's Future Was Mortgaged On Another Mountain Of Debt ... This Election Is Our Chance To Stand Up And Say: Enough Is Enough!" OBAMA: "I don't want to wake up in four years to find that more Americans fell out of the middle-class, and more families lost their savings. I don't want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete, our children's future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt, and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing. This time - this election - is our chance to stand up and say: enough is enough!" (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks, Espanola, NM, 9/18/08)
