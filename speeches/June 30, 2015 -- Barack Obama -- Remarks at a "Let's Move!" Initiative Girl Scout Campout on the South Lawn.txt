The President. You're camping on my lawn. I don't know how that happened.
Girl Scout. We're making history.
The First Lady. She says, "We're making history."
The President. You're making history. Well, actually, I think the reason that you guys are here is because we're celebrating the great outdoors
Girl Scouts. Yes.
The President. And the National Park Service is trying to make sure that young people "get outside, so you guys aren't watching TV all the time or playing video games all the time, but you're getting outside, getting some fresh air, and spending time with your friends and having adventures. And there are national parks all across the country, and it turns out that the White House is a national park.
The First Lady. Yes!
The President. Who knew? I didn't know that. Did I know that? I did?
The First Lady. They knew.
The President. You guys knew. Girl Scouts. Yes.
The President. Okay. So you guys are helping to celebrate and kick off this whole Great Outdoors adventure that everybody is having—going to be having this summer, right?
Girl Scouts. Yes!
The President. All right. So I don't really know any campfire songs. Are you guys going to teach me one?
Girl Scouts. Yes!
The President. Cathy, do you have a song?
[At this point, a troop leader made brief remarks. The Girl Scouts then sang a song, and the President and First Lady sang along.]
The President. Fantastic. That was outstanding. There's real talent here. You guys sounded pretty good. Had you practiced before?
Girl Scouts. No.
Girl Scout. We could go on "America's Got Talent."
The President. You could go on "America's Got Talent." No doubt about it. What's next?
[The troop leader made brief remarks, concluding as follows.]
Troop leader. You are all sisters. You're our sister too, Mr. President.
The President. I'm a brother. I'm a brother.
Troop leader. You're a brother.
The President. Hold on a second. Time out. I'm a brother.
Troop leader. Yes, but you're very in touch with your feminine side.
The President. Yes. Clearly.
Troop leader. That's what makes you so wonderful.
[The troop leader made additional remarks, and the Girl Scouts sang another song.]
The President. Yay! That was outstanding. Did you guys see the First Lady? Did you see the First Lady rocking out a little bit? [Laughter] She had some moves. Yes!
All right, well, this is a—you know what, you guys are having so much fun. Unfortunately, I've got to go to work.
Girl Scouts. No!
The President. I am not allowed to have fun. [Laughter]
Girl Scout. Can we have a hug?
Girl Scout. Can we hug?
The President. We can have a group hug.
[The Girl Scouts ran to the President for a group hug.]
The President. Those are some good hugs! I didn't know that Girl Scouts gave such good hugs. [Laughter] Who are those Girl Scouts over there? [The President pointed to the troop leaders.]
The President. They look at least like they're juniors. [Laughter]
Well, it's good to see you guys. I'm so glad you guys are having fun. All right? But I want to make sure—you guys better clean up this mess. [Laughter] When I come—when I wake up in the morning——
