    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I report revisions to two deferrals previously transmitted.
A deferral for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's overseas program of scientific activities has been increased by $10.7 million. In compliance with a court order, another revenue sharing payment--this one for $18.7 million-to the city of Chicago has been deferred by the Department of the Treasury.
The details of each revised deferral are contained in the attached reports.
