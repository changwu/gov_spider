    From West Coast to the East Coast, Edwards is the best candidate to win the general election and bring real change to America
Los Angeles, California – Today, John Edwards visited Los Angeles as part of his three-day coast to coast tour. Greeted by a crowd of more than 1,000 supporters at the Southern California Public Service Workers' headquarters, Edwards called on voters to join him in his campaign to take our country back from powerful entrenched interests and make our government work for working families and the middle class. From January 17th to January 19th, Edwards will visit Nevada, California, Oklahoma, Missouri, Georgia and South Carolina to demonstrate his broad, coast to coast strength and his advantage as the best candidate to win the general election. As a sign of Edwards' growing strength in California, he was today endorsed by Los Angeles City Councilman Richard AlarcÃ³n.
"To get real change, we need a president who will stand up against the big corporations and powerful interests who control Washington," said Edwards. "The American people – whether they live in rural areas or urban areas, red states or blue states – need a President who will stand up for them. As President, I will make sure the voices of all Americans are heard in Washington. If we fight together, we can get the change we need and America will rise."
Speaking at the SEIU Local 721, Edwards outlined his plans to stand up for hard-working families, like the ones he grew up with. From guaranteeing universal health care to creating good paying jobs and enacting trade policies that put the interests of workers, not multinational corporations first, Edwards will take on big corporate interests and help families get ahead. Born to a working class family and raised in small, rural towns, Edwards understands the struggles facing working families. He has spent his life standing up to powerful interests – and beating them.
Edwards' message is resonating with voters in red states and blue states, in big cities and small towns. In addition to strong grassroots support in these states, Edwards also enjoys the support of numerous labor groups and state and local elected officials who know that he is the best candidate to win the White House and bring real change to our country. A recent CNN poll showed Edwards was the only Democrat to beat all four leading Republicans nationally, and state by state polls show even more conclusively that Edwards is the most electable democrat in key battleground states -- and even wins in states like Missouri and Oklahoma that have gone "red" in recent presidential elections.
In California, Edwards enjoys the support of more than 760,000 union members across California, including the support of California's single largest union, the California SEIU State Council. Edwards has also won the support of dozens of diverse Democratic elected officials and party leaders from every region of the Golden State.
"John Edwards is the change candidate in this campaign -- the candidate with not only the boldest ideas for change, but the candidate who can win in November, strengthen Democratic majorities in Congress and at the state level, and make his ideas a reality," said SEIU CA State Council President Annelle Grajeda. "John Edwards can go to any part of the country and help Democrats down-ballot. With John Edwards as our nominee, we can get the change we need."
"I'm proud to support John Edwards because he understands, better than any other candidate, the challenges facing working Americans," said L.A. City Councilman Richard AlarcÃ³n. "Whether it's truly universal health care, fixing America's trade policy or ending America's involvement in Iraq, John Edwards has offered real solutions to the challenges Americans face, and he's determined to be a voice for regular people. I truly believe we need his leadership in the White House."
"After eight years of George Bush, it is critical that we have a Democrat in the White House," said L.A. City Councilman Herb Wesson. "We need a candidate who can bring real change to America and who can win. That candidate is John Edwards. He can compete and win in every part of the country, including red states and battleground states because Americans identify with who he is and what he stands for – fairness and opportunity and making sure everyone has a chance."
