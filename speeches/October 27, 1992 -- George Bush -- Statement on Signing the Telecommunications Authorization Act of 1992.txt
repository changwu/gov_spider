    Today I am signing into law H.R. 6180, the "Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992." The Act codifies authorities of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the Department of Commerce. The Act reflects the importance to the Nation of the development of sound telecommunications and information policies.
In addition to codifying these authorities, however, the Act contains some problematic and unnecessary provisions. I have instructed the Secretary of Commerce to work with the next Congress to amend or delete these troublesome provisions. Among the provisions that are unnecessary or disruptive to the efficient Federal management of telecommunications policy are the following:
-- Section 105(d), which restricts the Secretary of Commerce from reassigning any NTIA function without first reporting to specified congressional committees and waiting for 90 legislative days. This section undermines the Secretary's ability to manage the Department effectively.
-- Section 104, which will unnecessarily micromanage NTIA's responsibility for Federal use of the radio frequency spectrum by detailing specific requirements for public participation. NTIA is already meeting the laudable goal of increasing public participation in these activities.
The Act also contains provisions specifying responsibilities for the Department of Commerce in providing advice on telecommunications policies. These will be interpreted in a way that does not restrict my authority to supervise the executive branch.
