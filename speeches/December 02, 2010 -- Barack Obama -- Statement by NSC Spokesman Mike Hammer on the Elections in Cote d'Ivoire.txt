    The United States calls on all parties to respect the results of Cote d’Ivoire’s November 28 election as announced today by the Independent Electoral Commission. Those provisional results have declared Alassane Ouattara the winner over incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo. Credible, accredited electoral observers have characterized the balloting as free and fair, and no party should be allowed to obstruct further the electoral process.
After a decade of waiting, the people of Cote d’Ivoire have an opportunity to move forward along a democratic, rule-governed path. They have the strong support of the United States. Responsibility for allowing the democratic process to unfold peacefully and transparently falls squarely on the shoulders of Cote d’Ivoire’s leadership. The United States condemns acts of violence and intimidation intended to derail the democratic process and urges all parties to refrain from violence and incendiary rhetoric.
