    THE PRESIDENT. It is a great pity to have you walk all around the town and come here and then I have nothing.
We are issuing a report that we have received from the committee that was formed to expedite construction work in public utilities, but you will get that outside, and I don't need to read it to you. Otherwise than that there is nothing doing.
