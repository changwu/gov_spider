    Katie Levinson, Communications Director for the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee, made the following statement regarding John Edwards' political attack earlier today:
"For John Edwards to lecture Rudy Giuliani about September 11th is laughable at best. This is, after all, the same guy who thinks the War on Terror is simply a 'bumper sticker.'"
