    Former Alabama Congressman and Obama 2008 campaign national co-chairman Artur Davis today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about not being able to change Washington:Â 
"I can't remember the last time a presidency surrendered all of its promise as well as its promises so completely. A pledge to cut spending has turned into trillion dollar deficits, a pledge to retire the negative spin masters has turned into the most slashing negative campaign in the modern era, and 'hope and change' has given way to a sad song about how little power presidents have and to a confession that change is just too hard. Americans searching for a choice this November just got their latest confirmation that Barack Obama's best efforts just haven't worked. One more reason to give Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan a chance to undo the failed potential and the broken promises."
