    The United States welcomes the appointment of Ambassador Cindy McCain as the next Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme. With decades of humanitarian and business experience, Ambassador McCain will bring her strong leadership to one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world. Her appointment comes at a critical period as the world continues to experience record levels of acute food insecurity, with war and climate change threatening the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. The Biden-Harris Administration has made addressing global food insecurity a top priority, and as the leading donor to WFP we look forward to continued close collaboration with Ambassador McCain and the tens of thousands of personnel she will lead. We also want to recognize the immense contributions of outgoing Executive Director David Beasley and his tireless efforts to mobilize international attention and resources to ensure life-saving support reaches the world's most vulnerable.
