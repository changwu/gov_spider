    I am pleased to nominate Gen. Richard B. Myers, United States Air Force, to be Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If confirmed by the Senate, General Myers will succeed Gen. Joseph J. Ralston.
General Myers currently serves as Commander in Chief, United States Space Command; Commander in Chief, North American Aerospace Defense Command; and Commander, Air Force Space Command. He brings to the position of Vice Chairman extensive operational and planning experience as well as proven leadership ability. During this distinguished career, General Myers commanded the 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron, the 325th Tactical Training Wing, the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, U.S. Forces Japan, the 5th Air Force, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces. He is a Command Pilot with more than 3,900 flying hours, including combat missions in Vietnam. His broad professional experience also includes significant tours on the Joint Staff and Air Staff in the Pentagon.
General Myers assumes the post of Vice Chairman at a time of diverse challenges for our Armed Forces, ranging from preserving and enhancing military readiness to modernizing and transforming our forces to maintain our military superiority in the 21st century. I have the utmost trust and confidence in his ability to meet these challenges.
