    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Harkin (D) Iowa and 13 others)
The Administration would not object to enactment of S. 255 if it were amended to authorize appropriations only for FY 1989, and for no more than $10 million. Since the LRSAP has essentially served its purpose, the Secretary of Transportation would recommend veto of S. 255 if it authorizes appropriations in excess of this amount or for additional fiscal years.
