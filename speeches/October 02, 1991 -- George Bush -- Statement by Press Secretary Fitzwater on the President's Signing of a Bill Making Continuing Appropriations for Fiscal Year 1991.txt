    President Bush last night signed the Continuing Resolution H.J. Res. 332, which provides for continuing normal Government operations from October 1 to October 29. We are glad that Congress passed this resolution without extraneous amendments, but we urge action on all of the Government's appropriation bills.
Providing for the normal operation of the Government through continuing resolutions is an undesirable practice. However, a continuing resolution is necessary at this time in order to keep the Government functioning while the Congress completes the appropriations process.
