    Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Munich, Germany to attend the February 18-20 Munich Security Conference. Building on the Biden-Harris Administration's intensive engagement with European allies and partners, the Vice President's engagements in Munich will demonstrate our ironclad commitment to our NATO Allies, reaffirm our shared interest in upholding the principles that have underpinned European peace and security since World War II, and underscore our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
