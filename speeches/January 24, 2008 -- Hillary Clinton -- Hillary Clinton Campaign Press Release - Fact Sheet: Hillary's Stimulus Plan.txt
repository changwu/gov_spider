    While Senator Obama is more interested in playing political tit-for-tat, Senator Clinton believes the campaign's real focus should be on solving the economic challenges facing the country. The reality is that Senator Clinton detailed her stimulus plan days before Senator Obama introduced a plan. More importantly, she has a plan that jumpstarts the economy and addresses the housing crisis so that people are able to keep their homes. - Clinton campaign spokesman Phil Singer

  Experts Give High Marks To Hillary's Stimulus Plan

The New York Times Editorial Board: "[t]he proposals from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards are closer to what's needed and the type of stimulus that Congressional leaders and the White House should begin to discuss as soon as President Bush returns from his Middle East trip." [New York Times, 1/14/08]
Las Vegas Sun: Senator Clinton's stimulus plan is a sign that she "clearly has the best command of the issues." Senator Clinton's stimulus plan is a sign that she "clearly has the best command of the issues." "She also has an economic stimulus plan, including tax rebates for working- and middle-class families, that could help jump-start our sluggish economy, which is in danger of heading into a recession." [Las Vegas Sun,1/18/07]
Krugman: Hillary Clinton offered a 'somewhat larger proposal...which seems like a clever way to put cash in the hands of people likely to spend it.' "Last week Hillary Clinton offered a broadly similar but somewhat larger proposal. (It also includes aid to families having trouble paying heating bills, which seems like a clever way to put cash in the hands of people likely to spend it.)" [New York Times, Paul Krugman, 1/14/08]
McClatchy-Tribune Regional News: 'Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton's proposal for emergency energy assistance to help families with heating bills is also a good idea.' [McClatchy-Tribune Regional News, 1/24/08]
Hillary's plan is the only plan that includes aggressive measures to combat the foreclosure crisis. Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said that a plan that keeps families in their homes "would stimulate the economy." [New York Times, 1/23/07]


  Obama's Stimulus Plan Introduced Two Days After Hillary's Plan

Complete timeline here: http://facts.hillaryhub.com/archive/?id=5386
Newsday: "Obama's package was released two days after Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton...released an economic stimulus package of her own on Friday."Obama's package was released two days after Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, his chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, released an economic stimulus package of her own Friday. Obama has been accused of basing his appeal on optimistic speeches, without providing much of the details on how he would govern." [Newsday, 1/13/08]
Boston Globe: 'Clinton beat Obama to the punch in proposing an economic stimulus package.' "During that time, Clinton beat Obama to the punch in proposing an economic stimulus package - a shrewd move that buttressed her assertion to be the candidate of substance. And she zeroed in on economic concerns just as the recent stock-market plunge highlighted the need for economic action. Obama unveiled his stimulus package a few days later, but garnered less attention for being second out of the gate." [Boston Globe, 1/20/08]
Bloomberg: 'Obama, Following Clinton, Offers $75 Billion Stimulus.' [Bloomberg 01/13/08]


  Obama Plan Criticized As 'Less Progressive'

Krugman: 'Obama campaign's initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I'm sorry to say, disreputable.' Obama campaign's initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I'm sorry to say, disreputable: Mr. Obama's top economic adviser claimed that the long-term tax-cut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from "morphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending." Hmm: claiming that the candidate is all-seeing, and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recession-fighting measure - doesn't that sound familiar? [New York Times, Paul Krugman, 1/14/08]
Krugman: '[Obama's] stimulus proposal is similar to those of the other Democratic candidates, but tilted to the right.' "Anyway, on Sunday Mr. Obama came out with a real stimulus plan. As was the case with his health care plan, which fell short of universal coverage, his stimulus proposal is similar to those of the other Democratic candidates, but tilted to the right. For example, the Obama plan appears to contain none of the alternative energy initiatives that are in both the Edwards and Clinton proposals, and emphasizes across-the-board tax cuts over both aid to the hardest-hit families and help for state and local governments. I know that Mr. Obama's supporters hate to hear this, but he really is less progressive than his rivals on matters of domestic policy." [New York Times, Paul Krugman, 1/14/08]
