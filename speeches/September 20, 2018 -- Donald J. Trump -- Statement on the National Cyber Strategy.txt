    As I have made clear since my election as President, my administration will use all available means to keep America safe from cyber threats. The National Cyber Strategy that I have released today is an important step in keeping that promise.
We cannot ignore the costs of malicious cyber activity—economic or otherwise—directed at America's Government, businesses, and private individuals. Guided by this National Cyber Strategy, the Federal Government will be better equipped to protect the American people, the American homeland, and the American way of life.
Through it, we will accomplish critical security objectives while supporting American prosperity, preserving peace through strength, and advancing American influence. Informed by the strategy's guidance, Federal departments and agencies will more effectively execute their missions to make America cyber secure.
America built the internet and shared it with the world; now we will do our part to secure and preserve cyberspace for future generations.
