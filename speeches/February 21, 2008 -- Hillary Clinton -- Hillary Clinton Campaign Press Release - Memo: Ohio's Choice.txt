Re: Ohio's Choice
And now it's Ohio's turn - and Ohio's choice.
As Hillary criss-crosses the Buckeye State over the next two weeks leading up to the March 4 primary, she'll be presenting voters with a clear choice.
Do Ohioans want a President of lofty words -- or concrete actions? A President who is ready to be Commander-in-Chief on Day One - or who needs on-the-job training? Who believes in universal health care â€“ or would leave 15 million uninsured? Who has a plan to keep people in their homes--or doesn't think the foreclosure crisis is serious?
Ohioans are now called upon to help pick a president, and the stakes are high.
More than 85,000 houses were foreclosed in Ohio last year.
More than 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.
More than 1 million Ohioans have no health insurance.
The challenges facing Ohio are too big to tackle with just words - they require action.
When Ohioans decide who to hire for the toughest job in the world, will they pick someone in the speeches business or someone in the solutions business?
