    I commend the House of Representatives for acting quickly to pass landmark legislation to create a Homeland Security Department. This legislation represents the most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s. Our Nation needs a new department with the overriding mission of protecting the American people from the threats of terrorism.
This bill includes the major components of my proposalâ€”providing for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, strengthening our borders, improving the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and enhancing our preparedness and response capabilities.
The House bill also provides the Secretary of Homeland Security managerial flexibility needed to build and maintain a department capable of responding rapidly to the terrorist threats of the 21st century.
The House has shown a strong commitment to improving the security of the American people, and I urge the Senators to do the same before they leave for the August recess.
