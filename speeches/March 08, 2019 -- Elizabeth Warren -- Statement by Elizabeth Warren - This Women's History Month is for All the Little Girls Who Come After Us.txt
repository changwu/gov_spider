Happy Women's History Month! Starting in 2012, whenever I'd meet a little girl on the campaign trail, I'd tell her, “My name is Elizabeth, and I'm running for the Senate, because that's what girls do.” Then we'd pinky promise to always remember it.


I'm doing the same thing now — with one change: “I'm running for president, because that's what girls do.”
I want every little girl to grow up knowing that they can fight from the heart — and they can win.
This Women's History Month, there are more women than ever before in Congress and more women than ever running for president and showing little girls everywhere that their dreams are possible.
So today, and every day, I'm celebrating every woman who wakes up ready to fight to make life better for all the girls who'll come after us.
Make no mistake: We've got a lot of work to do — protecting a woman's right to control her own body, making sure women get equal pay for equal work, continuing to demand justice and accountability for sexual harassment and assault, stopping right-wing judges from trying to turn the clock back to the 1950s, and the fundamental issue of getting our government to work for our families, not just for the rich and powerful.
But we can get it done. Last year, record numbers of women stepped up to run for office, and record numbers of women won.
We're going to keep showing all the little girls out there that they can do it, too. Chip in now—$3 or whatever you can afford—so we can build this grassroots team and win.
