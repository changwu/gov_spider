    IT FALLS to few men in any generation to open up a totally new chapter in human history. Lewis L. Strauss, as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, was one of those few.
Under his direction, America began the crucial pioneering work of harnessing the atom for peaceful purposes. His vision and his leadership literally helped us to convert the most lethal of swords into the most promising of plowshares.
Lewis Strauss was a businessman of brilliance, a major philanthropist, an outstanding naval officer, and a superb public servant. But above all, Lewis Strauss was a trailblazer--a patriot who opened up new vistas and a new technology for America and the world.
Mrs. Nixon and I join with all our fellow citizens in mourning the passing of this outstanding American.
