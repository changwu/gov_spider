    Today, in response to Donald Trump's new inaccurate and misleading campaign ad, HFA Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds offered the following statement:
"Another day, another false ad from Trump. The truth is Trump's plan actually raises taxes on millions of middle class families, especially working single moms and dads, and showers the wealthy with huge tax cuts. Hillary Clinton has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class and will work to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. This stands in strong contrast to Donald Trump, who apparently did not pay a cent in federal income taxes for nearly 20 years and is now trying to hide the fact that his economic plan represents a huge boon to the very wealthy."
