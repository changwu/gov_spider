    I want to meet with the bipartisan leaders of Congress as soon as possible to arrange the procedure for deficit reduction discussions. As I have said previously, everything is on the table with the exception of Social Security, and there are no other preconditions. I hope that Congress will also agree to put everything on the table. This matter requires that both sides make contributions and develop a package that keeps spending and taxes as low as possible.
