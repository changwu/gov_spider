Travel Pool #5 - arrival at U of Tampa
The motorcade arrived at the University of Tampa at 12:55 p.m.
We passed a typical amount of people capturing the motorcade by phone as we drove by.
There were a few people holding signs in support or opposition as we pulled into the campus. One said "Free the Boys," an apparent reference to the Proud Boys. One was in support of Biden.
At the campus, students were lined up outside — on building steps, grounds & under palm trees - as we drove through. One group let out a big cheer.
We did not see POTUS exit the beast. Pool is now holding ahead of the president's remarks.
The stage has signs reading: Protect and Strengthen Medicare."

In the audience and press seats, there are White House brochures on Sen. Scott's 12-point plan to rescue America. Inside, it claims Medicare & Social Security would be on the chopping block every five years.
I will tweet a photo.

Travel Pool #10 -- POTUS done speaking
POTUS began speaking at 1:57 p.m. and ended at 2:21 p.m.
(It was hard to hear so please check transcript, per usual.)
Biden started by talking about his SOTU speech and how he told Republicans there's no reason they can't work together.
"Fighting for the sake of fighting gets us nowhere."
He said he came to FL to talk about a critical part of his plan: lowering health care costs.
He noted that Florida has the highest percentage of seniors before talking about what was in the Inflation Reduction Act to lower drug prices and criticizing the amount of money the pharmaceutical industry makes.
He said a lot of Republicans want to repeal the IRA and are still trying to end Obamacare.
He criticized FL for not expanding Medicaid under the ACA. The only reason it hasn't happened is politics, he said: "It's time to get this done" he added to big applause.
Biden referred to the "spirited" debate during the SOTU.
He held up the White House brochure on Sen. Scott's 12-point plan.
"Maybe he's changed his mind Maybe he's seen the lord," Biden said.
"If that's your dream. I'm your nightmare," he said of anyone who wants to cut SS & Medicare.
Biden said it sounded, at SOTU, like Republicans were agreeing to take SS & Medicare off the table. "I sure hope so."
He said he won't cut a single benefit from SS or Medicare.

Pool #1/South Lawn
Marine One is awaiting the president on the South Lawn. Pool and press corps have gathered.

Pool report #2/Biden departing White House- Poland
President Biden emerged from the residence at 10:10am on his way to Tampa.
"I haven't made a decision when I am going to Poland," he said.
Asked if he's considering going to Ukraine he said (I'm pretty sure) that he hadn't decided yet.
He boarded Marine One at 10:11.
Shrill whine of Marine One drowned out much of his comments. Will effort better quotes ASAP.

Pool report #3/Marine One has departed White House
Wheels up at 10:14am.
Traveling with the President aboard Marine One en route Joint Base Andrews:

pool report #4/Biden on whether he'll visit Poland or Ukraine
Departing White House before boarding Marine One:
q. When will you go to Poland and is there any possibility that you could go into Ukraine? (lots of crosstalk questions along these lines)
"I haven't made a decision when I'm going to Poland or even if for certain I am going to Poland," he said.
q. would you go to Ukraine too? (paraphrase)
"There's a possibility I may go to Poland, but that's all," he said. He emphasized "Poland" and it sounded clearly, to my ear, that he was ruling out a side trip to Ukraine.
Thanks to TV pool for their superior audio.

Pool report #7/lid
Pool was still holding on the driveway at the edge of the Rose Garden when Marine One revved at 6:27pm. The pool was on the move as it lifted two minutes or so later, though still plenty close to muss the hair. No further sightings of the president.
We have a lid at 6:32.
