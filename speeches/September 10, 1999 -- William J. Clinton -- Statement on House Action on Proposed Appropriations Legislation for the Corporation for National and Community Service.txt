    I am deeply dismayed that the House has passed an appropriations bill that includes no funding for the Corporation for National and Community Service. Since 1994, and with broad bipartisan support, AmeriCorps has given over 100,000 of our young people the opportunity to serve community and country. It has enabled Americans from every walk of life to work together to revitalize our neighborhoods and schools. The House's action sends exactly the wrong message to young Americans who want to make a difference in their communities. I have said before, and say again now, that I will veto any bill that inadequately funds AmeriCorps. But I hope that we can work with Members of Congress from both parties to restore full funding for this vital program.
