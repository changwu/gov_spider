    SIR ANTHONY EDEN, my good and long time friend, has been named the new Prime Minister of Her Majesty's government in the United Kingdom. He is a great successor to a great Prime Minister.
In war and in peace, Sir Anthony has been an outstanding spokesman of the free world. I know that he will continue unceasingly to serve the cause of world peace and freedom.
I join with my fellow Americans in felicitating him, a statesman of world stature, as he undertakes his new responsibilities.
