    Today, more than 50 mayors who formerly supported Mike Bloomberg for president formally endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The mayors cited Biden's longstanding leadership around health care, climate change, gun safety, and infrastructure, as well as their primary objective of beating Donald Trump in November.
"So many of us stood with Mike Bloomberg because of his passionate advocacy around guns and climate and because he's done so much to move our communities forward," said Mayor Keith James of West Palm Beach, Florida. "We know Joe Biden is deeply committed to these same goals, and I am excited to help him win Florida."
"Joe Biden has shown he is the candidate who can unite Democrats and generate incredible enthusiasm on the trail. That's what we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president -- and I will do everything I can to help Joe win," said Mayor Dan Horrigan of Akron, Ohio.
"Joe Biden has stood for working men and women, for healthcare for all Americans, and for climate action for decades. We can't afford another four years of Donald Trump in the White House and I am proud to stand with Joe," said Mayor Victoria Woodards of Tacoma, Washington.
