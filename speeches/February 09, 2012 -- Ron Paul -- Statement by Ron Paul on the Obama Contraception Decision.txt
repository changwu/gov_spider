LAKE JACKSON, Texasâ€” Congressman and 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul issued the following statement regarding the Obama Administration's announcement that religious organizations must pay for contraception and sterilization under the national health care law:
"Forcing private religious institutions to pay for contraception and sterilization as part of their health care plans is a direct assault on the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty. On my first day as President, I will reverse this policy. Repealing the unconstitutional monstrosity known as ObamaCare is a major part of my Plan to Restore America.
"I am the only GOP presidential candidate who has consistently opposed the federal promotion, funding, and mandating of contraception and abortion. Unlike Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, I never voted to provide taxpayer funding to Planned Parenthood. And unlike Mitt Romney, whose Massachusetts health care plan contained a contraceptive mandate similar to the one contained in ObamaCare, I have never supported any government health care mandates.
"When one compares my record with that of my opponents, it is clear that I am the only choice for Americans seeking a candidate they can trust to reverse the Obama administration's assault on their religious and other liberties."
This is the most recent statement in a series of comments issued by Paul regarding this move by the Obama Administration. You can find the August 4th statement here, and find the October 3rd statement here, and the statement applauding Becket Fund's defense of Belmont Abbey College here.
