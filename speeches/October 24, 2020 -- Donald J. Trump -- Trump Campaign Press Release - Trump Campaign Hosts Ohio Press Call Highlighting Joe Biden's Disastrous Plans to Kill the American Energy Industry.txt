    On the heels of Thursday's debate, in which Joe Biden admitted to supporting a radical, anti-energy agenda, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. hosted a press call with Representative Bill Johnson (OH-06) to highlight the disastrous effect Joe Biden's radical policies would have on the state of Ohio. President Trump has delivered on his Promises Made, Promises Kept for Ohioans and reinvigorated the American economy. Joe Biden's embrace of the the Democrat's party radical agenda would kill the energy industries that support millions of jobs for the American people.
"We know that Joe Biden is going to end fossil fuels, he's going to kill the oil industry, the fracking industry, the coal industry. Millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Ohioans will lose their jobs if America is left to the mercy of Joe Biden and his radical extreme agenda that he is carrying now for the American left," said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 Director of Communications.
"In 2016, the people of Ohio saw the light, and they elected Donald Trump - they went for Donald Trump by a wide margin of space, especially here in my district, because he promised them that he was going to be an energy-focused president, and he has done exactly that. Under President Trump, we are now a net oil exporter, I mean we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world," said Representative Bill Johnson (OH-06).
