    For nearly 2 years as Director of FEMA, Joe Allbaugh has served America with ability, courage, and compassion. He will continue to shepherd FEMA through its transition into the Department of Homeland Security.
After the attacks on our country, America came to know Joe as I do: He is a steady leader, a calm presence, and man who inspires confidence in a time of crisis. I have trusted Joe in a variety of positions throughout my public life, and he has always met the highest standards of service and integrity. Laura and I wish Joe the very best in all that he does in the future.
