    (New York, NY) October 13, 2015 - Today Donald J. Trump is announcing that State Senator Brad Zaun is endorsing his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States.
Mr. Trump stated, "I am grateful to have the endorsement of Senator Zaun who understands what is at stake in this election. Our country faces tough challenges. But America can be bigger and better than ever before. It will require leadership and a commitment to do what is right even when it may not be popular among the elites in Washington, D.C. who have created more problems than they have solved. With the support of Senator Zaun and so many other conservatives across the country, we will Make America Great Again".
Senator Brad Zaun was first elected to the Iowa Senate in 2004. Before serving in the Iowa Senate, Senator Zaun was the mayor of Urbandale, and owner and operator of Zaun's Trustworthy Hardware. He is currently Director of Sales at Master Dowel in Ankeny. Senator Zaun supported Governor Scott Walker before he dropped out of the race.
"I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for the Republican nomination for President of the United States," said Senator Zaun. "For me public service is about doing what is right for the people and following through on what you say you will do. I am confident that Mr. Trump will be that kind of President and that he has the leadership skills necessary to make America great again."
