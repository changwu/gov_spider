    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after earning the endorsement of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) BOLD PAC. BOLD PAC is the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC—a strong voice in Congress and across the country for the Latino community.
"I have always been proud to stand with the Latino community not only in fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, but fighting for all families to have the chance to get ahead and stay ahead. As a Senator, I was proud to vote for Ted Kennedy's immigration reform bill in 2007 and to co-sponsor the DREAM Act in 2003. As President, not only will I protect President Obama's executive orders and look to go further, but I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation from the moment I take office. While immigration reform is vital for our families, our economy, and our future, it's not the only issue where the Latino community needs progress. Nearly half of Latinos live in counties that don't meet EPA air quality standards. Latinos between 25 and 29 are less than half as likely to have a bachelor's degree as whites. Latinas working full time make just 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns. We need equal pay for women, environmental justice for families, and good schools in every ZIP code for our kids.
"I am proud to stand with the CHC BOLD PAC in all of these fights—because I believe that when families are strong, America is strong."
