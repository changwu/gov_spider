    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today about General David Petraeus' comments yesterday on "Fox News Sunday" that stabilizing Iraq could take as long as a decade.
"General Petraeus' comments are just the latest example of the Bush Administration's disconnect from the reality on the ground. In order to get the Iraqi people to take responsibility for their country, we must show them that we are serious about leaving, and the best way to do that is to actually start leaving. Instead of talking about keeping our troops in Iraq for another decade, the Administration should begin bringing our troops home to the hero's welcome they deserve.
"The American people have called for a new course in Iraq. It is time to end this war. Congress should correct its mistake and use its constitutional funding power to force an immediate withdrawal of 40-50,000 troops to stop the surge and force the Iraqis and regional powers to find a political solution, and require complete withdrawal of all combat troops within about a year."
