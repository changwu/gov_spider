PAUL RYAN: "We owe the country a very clear choice of a different future. We can either have a dynamic, growing economy that produces opportunity, or we can have a stagnant economy that fosters dependency. We can stick with the failed policies of the last four years for the next four years — or we can get a brighter future. Stagnation versus growth, dependency versus opportunity and upward mobility. That's the classic choice, the clear difference that we're offering."
