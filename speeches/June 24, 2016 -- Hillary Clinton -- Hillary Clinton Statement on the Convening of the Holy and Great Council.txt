    Hillary Clinton released the following statement to honor and celebrate the long-awaited bringing together of key Orthodox church leaders from around the world who represent about 200 million Orthodox believers. The Holy and Great Council last gathered more than a thousand years ago and the meeting taking place this week in Greece is nearly 50 years in the making:
"All people of faith should welcome the convening of the first Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Christian Church in over 1,200 years by His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. I have had the privilege of seeing Patriarch Bartholomew's spiritual leadership for myself, and am hopeful that the Council will renew ties that have frayed through the centuriesâ€”because we are stronger together."
