    THE SELECTION of a Vice President is one of the most critical choices any candidate for the Presidency has to make. First, the nominee must be a person of character and experience, capable of leading the country. Second, the nominee must articulate and support the principles of the Republican Party and be disposed to work in full harmony with the Chief Executive. Finally, the nominee must be an asset in the November campaign and a major contributor to governing the country in these next four years.
There are many qualified people in our Party. I am asking that you send me your suggestions by August 11, 1976, to help me in my deliberations. I would hope that you would be willing to furnish not less than five choices in order of your preference. I request that you sign your letter, and I assure you that your response will be handled in complete confidence.
I appreciate the time and thoughtfulness which I know you will devote to this matter. It is an important decision for our Party and for our country. I would fully understand, considering the status of the Presidential contest within our Party, if for any reason you would rather not respond. I do welcome any suggestions you may wish to submit and pledge my personal attention. I look forward to seeing you in Kansas City.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
