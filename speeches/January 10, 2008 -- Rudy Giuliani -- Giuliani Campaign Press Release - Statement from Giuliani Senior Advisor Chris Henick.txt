    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement from Senior Advisor Chris Henick following the FOX News debate:
"Only one man on stage tonight successfully cut taxes, slashed government spending and had the safety and security of millions of people on his shoulders. Rudy Giuliani is the only one who brings to the table a concrete plan that would be the largest tax cut in our nation's history and the tested leadership our country needs to stay on offense in the Terrorists' War on Us. There is just one man ready to lead our nation and that man is Rudy Giuliani."
