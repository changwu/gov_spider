    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Coelho (D) CA and 38 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 921. The bill is unnecessary, because adequate authority exists for conducting minimum altitude studies at selected national parks, such as the comprehensive study now underway at Grand Canyon National Park. In addition, the overly detailed requirements of H.R. 921 would result in a study costing over $3 million. Finally, by requiring the National Park Service to prepare a plan for air traffic management at Grand Canyon National Park, H.R. 921 would conflict with the Federal Aviation Administration's exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over airspace management.
