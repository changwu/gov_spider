    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement regarding the National Labor Relations Board's decision to drop its case against Boeing:
"The Obama Administration's dangerous and inappropriate action against Boeing and the right to work state of South Carolina remains a frightening reminder of Washington excess even with the NLRB dropping the case. Unaccountable federal political appointees should never have the authority to tell a private company where it may or must build factories.
"The NLRB action was a political payoff for the Obama Administration's liberal big labor organizers, and remains a strong example of why President Obama must be defeated and Washington must be seriously overhauled."
