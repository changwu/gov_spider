    Deputy National Security Advisor Benjamin J. Rhodes met on April 18 at the White House with human rights advocates and experts to discuss the situation in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. He was joined by senior Department of State and National Security Council officials. Participants offered views and ideas to inform preparation of the President's April 20-21 visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the second U.S.-GCC Summit. As it does across the globe, the United States will continue to raise with our Gulf partners the need for inclusive governance, strong civil societies, and respect for human rights.?
