    President Bush met today with a group of prominent Lebanese-Americans and His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor, to review the situation in Lebanon in light of the recent elections. The President reaffirmed the longstanding commitment of the United States to the unity, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Lebanon, the dissolution of all armed militias, and the withdrawal of all non-Lebanese forces. Consistent with these goals, the United States remains committed to the full and rapid implementation of both the spirit and the letter of the Taif agreement.
The President also expressed his support for steps that strengthen the Lebanese Armed Forces in its efforts to expand its national authority. The President also reiterated his belief that the ongoing negotiations between Lebanon and Israel offer the best means to bring about a secure border for the peoples of both countries. Finally, the President noted that he looks forward to the day when Americans can again travel in safety to Lebanon, a day which can only come when the militias are disarmed and no longer free to threaten either Lebanese or Americans.
