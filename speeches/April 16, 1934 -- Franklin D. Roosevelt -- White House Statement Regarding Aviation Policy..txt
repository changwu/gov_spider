    In conversation with Senators McKellar and Black and Congressman Mead, the President suggested that in connection with pending aviation legislation, it should be borne in mind that the United States has had no broad aviation policy; that a large number of inter-related factors enter into the general subjects of civilian and military flying and their subdivisions into material, personnel, manufacturing and experimentation.
The President suggested that in view of the lack of, and the need for, a national policy the Congress might well authorize the appointment of a commission to make immediate study and recommend to the next Congress a broad policy covering all phases of aviation and the relationship of government thereto.
Insofar as that part of aviation which relates to carrying U.S. mails is concerned, contracts could well be let on competitive bidding for one year or until such time as a broad policy relating to aviation as a whole is adopted.
