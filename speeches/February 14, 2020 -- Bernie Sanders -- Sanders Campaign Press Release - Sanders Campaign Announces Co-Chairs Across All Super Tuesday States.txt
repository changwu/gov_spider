    WASHINGTON â€“ Following Sen. Sanders' victory in New Hampshire, Bernie 2020 on Friday released a slate of over fifty state Co-Chairs across all Super Tuesday states. The Co-Chairs represent a diverse coalition of progressive elected officials, local activists and community leaders that show the strength of Senator Sanders' "Not Me, Us" movement in communities across the country.
"From Maine to California, Bernie 2020 is ready to compete and win in states across the country. We are the first campaign to release a slate of Co-Chairs, who will helm campaign efforts, in each of the Super Tuesday States," said Bernie 2020 National Political Director Analilia Mejia. "These Co-Chairs represent Bernie's multi-racial, multi-generational, working class movement to take on Donald Trump, and we are proud to work alongside them to build a progressive movement and elect Senator Bernie Sanders as the next President of the United States."
Co-Chairs include Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN-05) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (VT), Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Massachusetts' Varshini Prakash, Executive Director and Co-Founder of Sunrise Movement, and over 15 community leaders with deep ties to the environmental, racial justice and economic justice movements.
Since Sanders' wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, the campaign has announced efforts to immediately increase staffing in Super Tuesday states and invest more than $5.5 million in television and digital ads in ten Super Tuesday states.
