    From her earliest days as a child, Bonita Granville Wrather was a figure of beauty and grace in the motion picture business. Many people will remember her for the films she made that endeared her to her audiences and earned her a very special place in our hearts. But more than that, she was a warm and caring friend. For so many years, she enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty, and her love.
Bunny had a smile that lit up a room and love of life that made everyone who knew her feel special. We have so many warm and special memories of Bunny and Jack, and they live on in our hearts forever. Though we are deeply saddened by her death, we are comforted by the joy that can come only from having known and loved a true, dear friend. Truly, Bunny was more than a friend; she was family. We loved Bunny and will miss her deeply.
