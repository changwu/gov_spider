    Today, Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea (ROK) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, where they reaffirmed their determination to strengthen U.S.-ROK space cooperation across all sectors - civil, commercial, and national security. They received briefings regarding bilateral cooperation to address the climate crisis as well as space science. Additionally, the Vice President and President Yoon met with Korean-American space experts and discussed their contributions to strengthen the bilateral space partnership.
This builds on their September 2022 meeting in Seoul, where the two leaders discussed deepening joint work on space issues, the ROK's efforts to grow its own space program, and the importance of establishing and defending international norms in space. As part of our shared efforts on rules and norms, in their September meeting, the Vice President welcomed President Yoon's commitment not to conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing, a commitment that Vice President Harris announced in April 2022 on behalf of the United States.
Their visit to Goddard occurred as the nations mark the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and highlights the strong and growing U.S.-ROK partnership in outer space.
