Andy Roth, Club for Growth on "Your World with Neil Cavuto," Jan. 9, 2011



"Rick Perry I think has one of the best if not the best plans. He's got a 'Cut, Balance and Grow' plan where he wants to institute a Balanced Budget Amendment and cap spending at 18 percent, and then he wants to cut taxes all over the place that would just really be a pro-growth boon. It'd be eliminating capital gains, lowering corporate tax rates and personal tax rates down to 20 percent. Very, very strong plan."
Mr. Roth was also critical of Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney's economic records and plans:
"With Santorum... if you looked at his record when he was in the Senate, he was a prolific earmarker , he supported adding trillions to Medicare, so it's just not believable."
"Newt Gingrich is kind of in the Santorum camp... his track record is just very, very weak. You know, he supported Medicare Part D, which expanded entitlements in a huge way, he supported cap and trade with Hillary Clinton, the list goes on and on..."
"Mitt Romney...  actually deserves to be in last place on this because it's very uninspired ideas that he has. He barely wants to tinker around with the tax code and he wants to lower spending to 20 percent of GDP from its current 24 percent. "
