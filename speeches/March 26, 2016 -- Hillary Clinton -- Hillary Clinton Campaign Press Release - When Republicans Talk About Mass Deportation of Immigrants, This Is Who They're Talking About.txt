    
It's time to reform our broken immigration system.
This week in Arizona—a state that is home to some of the harshest anti-immigrant laws in the nation—Hillary once again pledged to make comprehensive immigration reform a top priority as president, and to do everything possible to keep families together.
One of those families is Lucia's.
Lucia is a Guatemalan immigrant Hillary met during the Univision Democratic town hall earlier this month. Alongside her five children, Lucia stood up on live TV and told her story. She explained that her husband had been deported three years prior—and her family hadn't seen him since.


  

Hillary promised she'd do everything she could to ensure other families wouldn't have to endure the same heartbreak—and she was so moved by Lucia's story that she talked about it in her primary night victory speech in Florida.



  " It's for the mother I met in Miami whose five children haven't seen their father since he was deported three years ago. She dreams of a day when deportations end and families are reunited."

Lucia's family is just one of countless families that have been devastated by deportation. An estimated 5.5 million children in the United States have at least one parent who is undocumented—and 4.5 million of those children are U.S. citizens.
When Republicans talk about mass deportation, they're talking about ripping parents away from kids like Lucia's.
Hillary is committed to doing everything she can under the law to keep families together. That includes ending the three- and 10-year bar, a law that forces many undocumented immigrants to either leave the country for a period of three or 10 years, or keep their families intact and remain in the shadows.
But that's not enough. And that's why, as president, won't stop fighting until we've passed comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship—once and for all.
