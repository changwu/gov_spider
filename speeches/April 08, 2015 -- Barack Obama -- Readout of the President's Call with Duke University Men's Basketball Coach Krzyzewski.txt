    Yesterday, the President called Duke University Men's Basketball Coach Mike Krzyzewski to congratulate him and his team on their exciting victory in the NCAA Men's College Basketball National Championship. The President noted that this win was the culmination of an impressive year for the team, and how inspiring it was to see so many underclassmen help lead the team throughout the tournament, particularly in the final game. The President looks forward to welcoming the Duke Blue Devils to the White House to congratulate the entire team in person.
