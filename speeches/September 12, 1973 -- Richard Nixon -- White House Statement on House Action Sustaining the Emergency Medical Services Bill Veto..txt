    THE PRESIDENT is pleased by the action of the House of Representatives in voting to sustain his veto of the emergency medical services bill. This shows restraint on the part of some Members of Congress to hold the line on spending and join the President's efforts in fighting inflation.
The President feels those Members of the House of Representatives who voted to sustain deserve the thanks of all Americans for their actions.
