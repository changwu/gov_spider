  A Proclamation

Pursuant to headnote 3 of subpart A, part 8, schedule 7 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), I have determined, on the basis of a report submitted to me by the United States International Trade Commission in accordance with Executive Order 11377 of October 23, 1967, that the estimated annual domestic consumption of brooms entered under TSUS items 750.26 and 750.29 has changed substantially since issuance of Presidential Proclamation 4443 of May 27, 1976, which last set the tariff-rate quotas for these items. The tariff-rate quotas set for items 750.26 and 750.29, therefore, should be modified, as provided below, to reflect the changes which have occurred.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including headnote 3 to subpart A, part 8, schedule 7, of the TSUS, do proclaim that
(1) the tariff-rate quotas for TSUS items 750.26 and 750.29 are modified by deleting the quantities 91,885 and 161,540 from the respective article descriptions and substituting in lieu thereof 61,655 and 121,478, respectively; and that
(2) the modifications made by this Proclamation shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the third day following publication of this Proclamation in the Federal Register.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 10th day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
