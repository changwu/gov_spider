Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Wright County, Iowa:
"This incident underscores the pressing need to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws. I strongly disagree with the other candidates in this race who are dismissive of increased enforcement efforts and continue to defend sanctuary city policies that weaken our border security efforts and create zones of protection for illegal immigration. Those policies are wrong and the defense of such policies highlights how a 3 million illegal immigrant problem became a 12 million illegal immigrant problem."
