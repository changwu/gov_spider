    Nearly 200 nursing schools and more than 50 pharmacy schools commit to prescriber training
Washington, DC—Today during an event at the White House, ten individuals from across the country will be honored as "White House Champions of Change" for their leadership in preventing prescription drug abuse and heroin use, increasing access to treatment, and supporting the millions of Americans in recovery. These individuals were chosen from more than 900 nominations. The event will feature remarks by White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, and Director of National Drug Control Policy Michael Botticelli. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy will host a discussion with Allison Janney, Emily Osment, and Chuck Lorre from the Warner Bros. Television-produced CBS comedy series Mom.
As part of today's event, and in coordination with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 191 schools of nursing at the academic institutions listed below announced that beginning in fall 2016 they will require their advanced practice registered nursing students to take some form of prescriber education by the time they graduate, in line with the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. Also today, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy announced that 54 colleges and schools of pharmacy will educate all their students about life-saving overdose interventions, including how to counsel patients and others on the appropriate use of naloxone.
As detailed below, the Federal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force is holding its first meeting today to advance access to treatment and promote compliance with health coverage parity implementation. Tomorrow the Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs — including opioids and other controlled substances — in communities across the country.
To address the national prescription opioid and heroin overdose epidemic, the Administration has been working to expand the use of tools that are effective in reducing drug use and overdose. These include evidence-based prevention programs, prescriber education, prescription drug monitoring, safe drug disposal, medication-assisted treatment, and the overdose reversal drug naloxone.
Last month, President Obama joined nearly 2,000 individuals in recovery, family members, medical professionals, law enforcement officials, and other leaders at the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. There he announced  new public and private sector actions and reiterated his call to Congress for  $1.1 billion in new funding to help every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment get the help they need.
The Champions of Change for Advancing Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery
Anita Bradley – Cleveland, Ohio
Anita Bradley is the founder and Executive Director of the Northern Ohio Recovery Association. She has been in recovery from a substance abuse disorder for over 25 years and understands the importance and magnitude of blending personal and professional knowledge to promote the power and possibility of recovery. Anita built a Peer-to-Peer training program offered at a local community college and opened the Next Step Recovery House, a residential recovery housing facility on Cleveland's near west side. Anita also recently launched a Statewide Network for Addiction to respond to the opioid crisis and ensure that the voice for recovery from substance use disorders is included in planning and policy efforts in Ohio. Anita was named winner of the 2015 Women Who Excel Entrepreneur Award by Smart Business Magazine and is a recipient of the Joel Hernandez Community Recovery Award.
Leonard Campanello – Gloucester, Massachusetts
Leonard Campanello is the Chief of Police in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Chief Campanello has worked to end the stigma of addiction by adding law enforcement's voice to those suffering with substance use disorders. In May 2015, in response to the growing epidemic of opioid use disorders, he announced a policy change that allows those with substance use disorders to ask for help and treatment resources from the Gloucester Police Department by walking into the station, with or without drugs, and without being charged with a crime. The policy also provided free naloxone (the opioid overdose reversal drug) for anyone in need. In the 10 months since it began, the Gloucester Program reports that it has brought 425 people directly to treatment with no criminal penalty and no solicitation of information, and has reduced crime and costs associated with substance use disorders in Gloucester and rebuilt the trust between the police and the community. The policy's success led to the creation of the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, which facilitates the proliferation of the Gloucester Program to over 100 communities in 22 States and partnerships with 250 treatment centers and growing.

Task Force Launched to Ensure Health Coverage Parity for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders
In addition, the Federal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force is holding its first meeting today. The President established the Task Force last month to advance access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and promote compliance with mental health and substance use disorder parity implementation. Federal parity protections are intended to ensure that health plans' coverage of mental health and substance use disorder benefits is comparable to their coverage of medical and surgical benefits.
National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day
Tomorrow, the Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs — including opioids and other controlled substances — in communities across the country. More than 5.5 million pounds of medication have been collected over the last ten Take Back Days.
Local communities are also establishing ongoing drug take-back programs, and to support these efforts, Walgreens is installing safe medication disposal kiosks in more than 500 drugstores across the country, primarily at locations open 24 hours.
Background on Administration Actions on Opioids
In October 2015, as part of his visit to West Virginia to discuss the prescription opioid abuse and heroin epidemic, the President  announced a number of new public and private sector actions, including a Presidential Memorandum requiring Federal Departments to provide training on appropriate opioid prescribing to Federal health care professionals and requiring Departments to develop plans to address barriers to opioid use disorder treatment in Federal programs. Departments are ahead of schedule in fulfilling the President's directive that Federal agencies ensure that all employees who prescribe these drugs are trained in appropriate opioid prescribing practices by 2017. In addition, since the President's Memorandum was released, Departments have taken numerous steps to expand access to opioid use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment.
For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently issued a proposed rule to increase the current patient limit for qualified physicians who prescribe buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorders from 100 to 200 patients with the goal of expanding access to this evidence-based treatment while preventing diversion. The proposed rule aims to increase access to medication-assisted treatment and behavioral health supports for thousands of people with opioid use disorders.
HHS also released $94 million in new funding to 271 Community Health Centers across the country earlier this month to increase substance use disorder treatment services, with a specific focus on expanding medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorders in underserved communities. This funding is expected to help health centers treat nearly 124,000 new patients with substance use disorders.
Earlier this week,  HHS issued new guidance to give as many as 96,000 Americans transitioning from incarceration back to their communities access to health care through Medicaid, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. Historically, the vast majority of justice-involved individuals have been uninsured, and roughly half of incarcerated individuals struggle with mental health conditions and substance use disorder. Uninterrupted access to health care coverage can help lower health care costs, hospitalizations and emergency department visits, as well as the risk of re-incarceration.
These actions build on efforts that began in 2010 when the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, which emphasized the need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment. In 2011, the White House released its national Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, which outlined goals for addressing prescription drug abuse and overdose.
Since then, the Administration has supported and expanded efforts to prevent drug use, pursue "smart on crime" approaches to drug enforcement, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery.
The Champions of Change program was created as an opportunity for the White House to feature individuals doing extraordinary things to empower and inspire members of their communities. The event will be streamed live on www.whitehouse.gov/live. To learn more about the White House Champions of Change program, visit www.whitehouse.gov/champions.
