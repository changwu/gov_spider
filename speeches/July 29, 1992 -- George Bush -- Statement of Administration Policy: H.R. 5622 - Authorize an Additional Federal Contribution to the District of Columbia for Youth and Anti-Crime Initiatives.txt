    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Dellums (D) California and Norton (D) District of Columbia)
The Administration would not object to House passage of H.R. 5622 if it were amended to delete the requirement that certain expenditures be approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. This provision purports to authorize legislative action other than by the constitutionally prescribed method of bicameral approval and presentment to the President. It therefore is unconstitutional.
