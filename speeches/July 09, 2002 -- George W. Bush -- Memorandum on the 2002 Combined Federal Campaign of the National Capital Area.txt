    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: 2002 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area
I am delighted that the Secretary of Agriculture, Ann M. Veneman, has agreed to serve as the Chair of the 2002 Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) of the National Capital Area. I ask you to enthusiastically support the CFC by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your Vice Chair.
The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
GEORGE W. BUSH
