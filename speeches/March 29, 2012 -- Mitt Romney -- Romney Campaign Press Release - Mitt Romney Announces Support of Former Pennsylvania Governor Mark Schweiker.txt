    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Pennsylvania Governor Mark Schweiker.
"I'm proud to earn Mark's endorsement," said Mitt Romney. "Pennsylvania is a state with a long history of strong conservative leaders and Mark is no different. Like me, Mark spent most his life as a businessman who took what he learned in the real economy and used it to better serve his state. If elected, I hope to bring these same traits to Washington, D.C."
"As a businessman for much of my life, I can tell you that those in government don't have all the answers," said Governor Mark Schweiker. "We need a leader who has spent his life solving problems in the real world. Mitt Romney fits that description perfectly. He spent his life as a conservative businessman — creating jobs and actually balancing budgets. If Americans are looking for someone who knows how to get this economy growing again and who will instill a vision to make our country more prosperous, they need to look no farther than him. I am proud to stand with Mitt Romney and encourage Pennsylvanians to join me."
