    It is with great sadness that we learned today of the United States sailor fatalities following the August 21st collision between the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain and a merchant vessel, which occurred east of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. As the Navy begins the process of recovering our fallen sailors, our thoughts and prayers go out to their families and friends. We are grateful for the rescue and recovery efforts of the officers and crew of the USS John S. McCain, the Malaysian Coast Guard, Royal Malaysian Navy, and Royal Singaporean Navy. The Department of Defense will conduct a thorough and complete investigation of the incident.
