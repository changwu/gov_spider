    Today I have signed into law S. 1462, the "Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991." This legislation is designed for the laudable purpose of protecting the privacy rights of telephone users. However, the Act could also lead to unnecessary regulation or curtailment of legitimate business activities. That is why the Administration opposed it when it was pending before the Congress. Indeed, the Administration is firmly opposed to current congressional efforts to re-regulate the telecommunications industry.
I have signed the bill because it gives the Federal Communications Commission ample authority to preserve legitimate business practices. These include automated calls to consumers with whom a business has preexisting business relationships, such as calls to notify consumers of the arrival of merchandise ordered from a catalog. I also understand that the Act gives the Commission flexibility to adapt its rules to changing market conditions. I fully expect that the Commission will use these authorities to ensure that the requirements of the Act are met at the least possible cost to the economy.
