    WEST DES MOINES, IA â€“ Today, presidential candidate Ted Cruz invited Donald Trump to a one-on-one debate held before Iowa Republican voters caucus and make their selection for president. The event would take place at Western Iowa Tech Community College in Sioux City this Saturday, January 30th at 8:00 p.m. Cruz suggested the moderators either be radio hosts Mark Levin, Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, or that the format simply be questions from the audience.
"We owe it to the men and women of Iowa to ensure that they hear jointly and directly from the two leading Republican candidates so that they may contrast our positions on the critical issues we face as a nation as they make their final choice leading up to Monday's caucuses," said Cruz.
The venue has already been reserved and the Cruz campaign anxiously awaits a response from Donald Trump.
The full letter from Cruz:
January 27, 2016
Dear Donald,
We owe it to the men and women of Iowa to ensure that they hear jointly and directly from the two leading Republican candidates so that they may contrast our positions on the critical issues we face as a nation as they make their final choice leading up to Monday's caucuses.
Accordingly, please accept this invitation to join me at an in-person, two-hour Town Hall event at Western Iowa Tech Community College in Sioux City this Saturday, January 30th at 8:00 p.m. Central. This venue is already reserved and I would propose that our campaigns evenly divide available seating/ticketing. Our teams can jointly work on the logistical details.
Additionally, I propose one of the following three individuals serve as a Town Hall facilitator: Mark Levin, Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh. If none of these proposed individuals are acceptable to you, I suggest that instead we alternate in fielding direct questions from the audience.
I look forward to your timely response.
Ted
