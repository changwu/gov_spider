(House)
(Rep. Lofgren (D) California)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5803 because it largely duplicates existing law and is administratively burdensome. Over $3 billion in Federal grants have been made available to States in 2008 and previous years to assist with election systems and administration, which can include the purchase of back-up paper ballots authorized by this bill. Of this amount, over $1 billion remains unspent and should be used by States as appropriate to prepare for and conduct the 2008 Federal elections. More than 6,000 jurisdictions would be eligible to apply for funding authorized by this bill, which would divert the attention of the Election Assistance Commission during a time when they should be helping election officials to prepare for and administer the 2008 Federal elections. New legislation and election funding initiatives are not warranted at this time.
