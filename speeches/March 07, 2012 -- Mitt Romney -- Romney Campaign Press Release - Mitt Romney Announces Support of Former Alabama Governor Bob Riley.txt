    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Governor of Alabama Bob Riley.
"I am honored to receive the support of Governor Riley," said Mitt Romney. "He spent his career standing up for the conservative principles of lower taxes and reduced spending. His service to Alabamians is long and distinguished and I am excited to work with him to spread my conservative message across the country."
"It is my honor to endorse Governor Mitt Romney for President," said Governor Bob Riley. "Mitt Romney is the only candidate with the leadership and business experience to take our country through this difficult economic situation and bring us out stronger. As a small businessman myself, I believe we need someone in the White House who has led in the private sector and knows how to create jobs for Americans, who knows that excessive taxation and regulations only burden small business owners, and who can lead our nation's economy back to prosperity. If ever there was a time for America to have a job creator in the White House, it is now."
