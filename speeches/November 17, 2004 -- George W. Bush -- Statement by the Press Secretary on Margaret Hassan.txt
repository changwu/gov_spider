    We express our deepest sympathy to the family of Margaret Hassan who was killed in Iraq. We strongly condemn the abduction and murder of this prominent humanitarian. Mrs. Hassan worked tirelessly and with great compassion for more than 25 years to assist the poor and disadvantaged in Iraq, particularly children. As a humanitarian she directed programs to serve the neediest through independent, non-governmental organizations and was not involved in the political process or military activity in Iraq. Her death is a great loss to the Iraqi people and the world. Our condolences go to her husband, Tahseen Hassan, her family, and her friends around the globe.
