    I am sending Bill Simpson of my staff to Mississippi as my personal representative to assure that all appropriate and necessary federal assistance is being made available. He is due to arrive in Jackson at approximately 9:15 a.m. Tuesday, April 17.
As you know, Bill is a native of Mississippi and served until recently as administrative assistant to former Senator Eastland. He has the authority to insure that the federal government's response to this disaster situation is timely and of maximum assistance to the people of the affected areas, and he will report to me on his return to Washington.
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your fellow citizens.
JIMMY CARTER
