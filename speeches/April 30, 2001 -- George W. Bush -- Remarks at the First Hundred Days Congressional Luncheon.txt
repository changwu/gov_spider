    Thank you all. Thank you for coming. I appreciate you bringing such nice weather. It's good to see members of my Cabinet who are here. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here.
Today marks our 100th day of working together for the American people. We've had some good debates. We've made some good progress, and it looks like we're going to pass some good law.
I've now met with most of you, and here's what I think: I think America is lucky to have such distinguished citizens coming to Washington to represent them. I've been impressed by the caliber of the person. I've been impressed by the conviction that you brought to the Oval Office.
Oh, I know we always don't agree. But we're beginning to get a spirit here in Washington where we're more agreeable, where we're setting a different tone. So when the good folks of this country look at our Nation's Capital, they see something they can be proud of.
I want to thank you all very much for your service to the country. I want to thank your families for the sacrifice they make. I also want to thank you for the constructive spirit in which we've conducted the people's business. I know this: That whatever your views on a particular issue are, that we share a common goal, and that is to serve our country. And it's okay sometimes to share a meal, and that's why we're here. [Laughter]
So I want to thank you for being here. If you will join me in the East Room, I think we've got some pretty good food for you.
Thanks for your service. God bless.
