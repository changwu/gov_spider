    David Paulison, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), this afternoon notified Governor Bill Richardson that FEMA has approved federal relief funding for Curry and Quay counties after President Bush officially declared the county a major disaster area. Governor Richardson, along with part of the New Mexico delegation, met with Paulison to urge a quick response. The official letter of request was sent Thursday, March 29.
"This means relief is on the way for residents who are struggling to take care of their families and businesses and get back on their feet," said Governor Richardson. "I am sure this quick response is a result of a personal meeting with Director Paulison and the unified front projected by Congressman Udall, Senators Bingaman and Domenici, and myself. I am grateful the President and FEMA recognize the extensive damage caused by the tornadoes in Curry and Quay counties"
The presidential disaster declaration will make the Individual Assistance Program available to all qualified homeowners, business owners, and renters in Curry and Quay counties eligible for assistance from the federal government. FEMA may be able to provide temporary housing, repair, replacement, and permanent housing construction to qualified households or other housing needs like disaster related medical or dental costs, clothing, household items, tools, cleanup items, damaged vehicles, or other necessary expenses or serious needs as determined by FEMA.
The award also includes Crisis Counseling, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans, and Hazard Mitigation.
