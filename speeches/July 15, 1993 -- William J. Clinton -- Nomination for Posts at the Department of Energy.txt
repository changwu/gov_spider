    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Martha Krebs and Corlis Moody to senior positions at the Department of Energy. Krebs will be Director of the Office of Energy Research, and Moody will be the Director of the Office of Minority Economic Impact.
"It gives me great pleasure to announce these nominations today," said the President. "Martha Krebs has demonstrated tremendous leadership capacity as an administrator of one of our country's most important research facilities and a senior congressional aide. As for Corlis Moody, Secretary O'Leary knows better than anyone the high quality of work that she has done in the past and is capable of doing at the Department of Energy. I welcome both of their service."
