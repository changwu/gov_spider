    SAN ANTONIO, TX (January 6, 2020) – On Monday, January 6, 2020, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro, endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren for President of the United States. In a video released Monday, the former presidential candidate explained why he believes Senator Warren is the most qualified, best-equipped candidate to win the nomination, defeat Donald Trump, and build a nation where everyone counts.
"Theres one candidate I see who's unafraid to fight like hell to make sure America's promise will be there for everyone," said Secretary Julián Castro in the video. "Who will make sure that no matter where you live in America or where your family came from in the world, you have a path to opportunity too. That's why I'm proud to endorse Elizabeth Warren for President."
Following his endorsement, Secretary Castro will travel to New York to campaign alongside Senator Warren at a joint rally at Brooklyn's King Theatre.
As a former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, HUD Secretary under President Obama, and groundbreaking presidential candidate, Secretary Castro is among the most high-profile endorsers in 2020, and only the second endorsement from a former 2020 presidential candidate. Secretary Castro inspired millions with his historic campaign—distinguished for his efforts to fight for the most vulnerable people, marginalized communities, the poor, and those left out of the political process.
