    We welcome the UN General Assembly Third Committee’s passage today by a wide margin of a resolution noting the ongoing violations of human rights in Iran and calling upon the Government of Iran to fulfill its obligations in this area. Iranian citizens and others continue to face abuses at the hands of the Iranian government. Those abuses undermine Iran’s standing in the international community and call into question the Government of Iran’s commitment to the principles of justice and the welfare of its citizens. By adopting the resolution, the international community has sent an unequivocal message to the Iranian government that universal rights must be respected. The United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights.
