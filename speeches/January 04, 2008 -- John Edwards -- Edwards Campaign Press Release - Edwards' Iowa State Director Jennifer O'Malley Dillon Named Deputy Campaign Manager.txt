    Edwards campaign will use momentum from strong Iowa finish to build on Edwards' organization in other early states
Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, the John Edwards for President campaign announced that Iowa state director Jennifer O'Malley Dillon will now serve as a deputy campaign manager. The campaign also announced that staffers from Iowa will be departing today for South Carolina and Nevada to build on momentum generated from Edwards' strong finish last night.
"I am excited to announce today that Jennifer O'Malley Dillon will continue to work as part of the Edwards team," said Edwards' campaign manager Congressman David Bonior. "We will use our momentum from a strong finish in Iowa to build support for Edwards in other key states. As we head into the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday and the elections in Nevada and South Carolina in the coming weeks, I have confidence in the strength of our organization and the power of John Edwards' message of fixing the broken system in Washington and fighting for the middle class."
In Nevada, the Edwards campaign recently added two dozen field staffers and now will be shifting additional staffers from Iowa. Edwards also enjoys strong labor support in Nevada with endorsements from the Carpenters, Steelworkers, Transport workers and Communication workers who combined represent more than 28,000 members in the state.
Edwards also remains well positioned to compete in his home state of South Carolina – which he won in 2004 by 15 percentage points. And to help Edwards compete in the February 5th states, last night the coalition of 12 SEIU state councils that have endorsed Edwards announced they would spend an additional $1.5 million on communication and voter turnout among the more than 750,000 SEIU members in those states.
This morning, the campaign announced record-breaking online fundraising totals, putting the campaign on track for its best online fundraising day since www.JohnEdwards.com went up over a year ago.
