    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by flooding, high surf, high winds, and wind-driven rain associated with Typhoon Tingting on June 27-29, 2004.
Federal funding is available to Commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by flooding, high surf, high winds, and wind driven rain associated with Typhoon Tingting in the islands of Rota, Saipan, and Tinian.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named William Lokey as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
