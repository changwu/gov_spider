    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 Budget amendments for the Departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. These amendments will increase by $155 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2011 Budget.
These amendments are necessary to reflect correctly policies assumed in the FY 2011 Budget. The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
