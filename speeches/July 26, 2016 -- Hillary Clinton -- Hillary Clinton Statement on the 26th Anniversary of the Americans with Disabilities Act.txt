    Today, on the 26th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a bipartisan bill which guarantees civil rights protections for more than 56 million Americans, including almost 4 million veterans, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"The Americans with Disabilities Act made our country more inclusive, our economy stronger, and our society fairer. This landmark law opened educational opportunities, expanded transportation, ensured equal access to public buildings, and outlawed employment discrimination on the basis of disability. The ADA enables people with disabilities to participate more fully in their communities and live more inclusive lives.
"But we know we have more work to do. I am committed to realizing the full promise of the ADA expanding opportunity for the over 50 million Americans living with a disability—because we're stronger together.
"As President, I will continue to advance disability rights and work to fulfill the promise of the ADA. I will work to expand support for people to live in integrated community settings, consistent with the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision. As part of that effort, I will push Congress to enact the Disability Integration Act so that Americans with disabilities who need long-term services and supports can receive that care in home- and community-based settings if they so choose. And I will work to improve access to competitive integrated employment. We must honor the spirit and substance of the law and recommit ourselves to defending and strengthening it to help ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential."
