    CHICAGO, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama made the following statement in response to Karl Rove announcing his resignation as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.
"Karl Rove was an architect of a political strategy that has left the country more divided, the special interests more powerful, and the American people more shut out from their government than any time in memory. But to build a new kind of politics, it will take more than the departure of a man or even an Administration that constructed the old it will take a movement of everyday Americans committed to changing Washington and reclaiming their government."
