To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith report four new proposed rescissions and six new deferrals as required by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. In addition, I am transmitting two supplementary reports which revise deferral reports made to the Congress in previous special messages.
Five of the reports contained herein are withholdings in the fourth quarter of funds authorized under the Continuing Resolution for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Resolution of two of these items might be better served by action upon the Administration's appropriation request for health planning and emergency school aid in the Second 1975 Supplemental Appropriation bill now pending before the Congress.
The items I am submitting in-this special message, along with other actions I have already proposed, provide a means of restraining budget outlays and thereby can help hold the fiscal year 1976 budget deficit within reasonable bounds. When I signed the tax reduction bill on March 29, 1975, I noted that the estimated 1976 deficit had reached about $60 billion and was threatening to go as high as $100 billion. Such an enormous deficit could generate another inflationary spiral and might well choke off any economic recovery. I will continue to resist every attempt to add to the deficit.
The details of the rescission and deferral reports are attached.
