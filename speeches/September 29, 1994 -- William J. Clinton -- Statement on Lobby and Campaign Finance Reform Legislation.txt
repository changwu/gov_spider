    The American people have made it clear that they want a change in the way Washington works. From the beginning of my administration, I have called upon Congress to enact tough political reform legislation. Today Congress made real progress in the effort to return Government to the people. It is now time for Congress to finish the job and enact lobby reform and campaign finance reform, so that narrow interests are never able to obstruct the national interest.
The House of Representatives took a major step toward changing the culture of the Capital when it voted for lobby reform. This legislation will, for the first time, require lobbyists to fully disclose their activities, their clients, and the sources of their funding. And it will bar lobbyists from providing gifts, meals, and entertainment to lawmakers. I call on the Senate to quickly pass lobby reform and send it to my desk. We must take the political system away from the lobbyists and the narrow interests in Washington and give it back to the American people.
I am also heartened by the agreement between House and Senate leaders on campaign finance reform legislation. This bill will limit congressional spending, curb the PAC's and lobbyists, open the airwaves to debate, and ban the use of soft money in Federal elections. Make no mistake: this is real reform. Tomorrow the Senate will vote to end a filibuster and appoint conferees on this bill. I call on Senators from both parties to put aside partisanship and move forward with this legislation. There is simply no excuse for delay.
