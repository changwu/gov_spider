    Q: Madam Vice President, on the SCOTUS ruling today, I'm wondering -- the Biden administration promised a whole-of-government response to S.B. 8. So after DOJ's lawsuit was defeated, what will the Biden administration do next?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, listen, the ruling today is an attempt to undo -- in terms of what's happening in Texas, Mississippi, and around the country -- is an attempt to undo 50 years of precedent.
And as far as I'm concerned and as far as our administration is concerned, a woman's right to make decisions about her own body is non-negotiable.
And so we will continue to fight for the constitutional right of all women to make decisions about their own body without interference by some legislative group of people that think that they can replace their judgment with hers.
