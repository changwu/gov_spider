    On Read Across America Day, we join with students and their families, teachers and librarians, and communities across our Nation in promoting the joy of reading and the many ways in which literacy enriches our lives.
Since 1998, Americans have celebrated Read Across America Day to help inspire young people to read and to support literacy for all our citizens. Throughout history, literacy has led to incredible discoveries, groundbreaking innovations, and development of the world's greatest minds. By enabling us to explore new subjects and challenging us to think critically, reading helps power the success of our Nation.
As we mark this special day, let us remember that all children hold the promise of a bright and beautiful future, and it is through the wonderful gift of reading that they begin to learn, grow, and explore. In the timeless words of Dr. Seuss, "the more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." May these truths be a reminder of the duty we all share to instill a love of reading in future generations.
