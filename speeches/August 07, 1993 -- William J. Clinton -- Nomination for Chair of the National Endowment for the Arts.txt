    The President today announced his nomination of award-winning actress, producer, and author Jane Alexander as Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.
"The arts play an essential role in educating and enriching the lives of all Americans, and the National Endowment is integral to helping arts thrive throughout the country. The NEA helps enhance our children's learning, serves as an economic catalyst for local communities, and makes the arts a more accessible and vital part of people's everyday lives," said the President.
"The Endowment's mission of fostering and preserving our Nation's cultural heritage is too important to remain mired in the problems of the past. It is time to move forward, and Jane Alexander is superbly qualified to lead the Endowment into a new era of excellence. Just as she has brought the power of performance to regional theaters throughout the country, she will be a tireless and articulate spokesperson for the value of bringing art into the lives of all Americans.
"More than 30 years ago, President John F. Kennedy said, â€˜I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist.' With those words as her challenge, I am confident Jane Alexander will work tirelessly and courageously to make the arts a full and productive partner in our Nation's future," the President said.
