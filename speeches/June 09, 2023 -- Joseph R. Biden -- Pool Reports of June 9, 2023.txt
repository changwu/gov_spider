Travel pool report 2 - boarding AF1
At 10:36 am the motorcade pulled up to the AF1 steps (lower stairs and big plane for those tracking).
Exiting the Beast alone, POTUS did not respond to pool's shouted questions on the Trump indictment. He wore the Aviators and a blue suit.
Pool has not seen the First Lady. The White House says she was already aboard before POTUS.
We are taxiing at 10:44, wheels up shortly.
Next stop: Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, in Goldsboro, NC.

Travel pool report 3 - wheels down NC
AF1 landed at Seymour Johnson AFB, Goldsboro, at 1130 am. Other than the principal deputy press secretary's 16 minute gaggle and a rather sparky chicken dish (involving "fusion," one esteemed colleague said) for brunch, nothing to report from flight.
POTUS and FLOTUS, holding hands, disembarked from AF1 at 11:43 am. The lower steps again. President Biden did not approach pool to gaggle.
The first couple immediately boarded Marine One.
Press now loading an Osprey, headed for Rocky Mount-Wilson Regional Airport, Elm City.
Note from JBA, AF1 was wheels up at 10:47 am.
Also, the WH sent this list of greeters and travelers:

Travel pool report 4 - wheels down Elm City
At 12:10 pm M1 was wheels down at Rocky Mount-Wilson Regional Airport, Elm City.
POTUS and FLOTUS disembarked at 12:16 pm and climbed into the Beast - far too distant from pool for questions.
At 12:19 pm the motorcade is rolling for Nash Community College where the first couple will tour a jobs training program.



June 9, 202312:48

Travel pool report 5 - Nash CC
At 12:38 pm the motorcade pulled into Nash Community College.
Pool was unable to see POTUS or FLOTUS on arrival.
The approx 20 minute drive passed through miles of bucolic NC - horse paddocks, wheat fields, wooden barns, ponds, cows, mown hay, and large pickup trucks. The usual thin lines of onlookers videoing the motorcade on cellphones appeared. Pool saw a man displaying a Trump 2024 flag and other poolers saw around half a dozen more. A Ukrainian flag flew from a Jeep. Poolers spotted just a couple groups waving, though our van is right at the back so it may be that those in the Beast witnessed more activity.

Travel pool report 6 - tour at CC + Trump case quote
The president and first lady entered a room filled with very clean, complex machinery, including two yellow robot arms, where advanced manufacturing is taught.
FLOTUS came in first with a stirring "good morning!" to the pool. "How are you," the president said more softly to staff from the college.
Staff lauded the success of the training school in getting grads into jobs in manufacturing, IT, auto and pharmaceutical areas. "95 to 100 percent get jobs," one said
A student, Bryce Lewis, then demonstrated how the yellow robot arm can move things around. "It may look easy," Lewis said, explaining that it isn't. The president watched intently and asked: "what did that just do?"
When the student seemed to have a moment of difficulty, Biden said: "you're doing a great job!"
At another machine, a staff member switched on a mechanism that seemed to resemble a miniature assembly line. It wheezed and puffed and moved things around.
Biden, arms crossed, asked "and a student programmed" it?
Trump comment:
After 12 minutes pool was pulled. As we left, reporters asked about the Trump indictment news, and POTUS responded: "I have no comment."
The president is about to deliver an address on jobs in another machine training room. This is broadcast live.
From the WH:

Travel pool report 7 - speech + Trump related quote + motorcade
President Biden spoke for about 17 minutes after being introduced by a student named America Alonso Gomez.
You will have heard the broadcast. In case not, he touched on his recurring themes about the value of community college ("the best kept secret in America"), his job creation record and how for too long the middle and working class were "hollowed out" with "factories closing down all over America."
Manufacturing is "coming back" he said, prompting applause.
Biden talked about his motivation to run for president in 2020 and "change the direction " of the economy. He talked about the infrastructure package, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the IRA (which got applause). "Manufacturing is back," he said.
Roving briefly from the podium to get close to the audience, Biden referred to climate change and all the fires he's flown over. Then he was back at the podium to criticize trickle down economics and how none of that "trickled down" to his family's kitchen table as a youth.
Applause rang out when the president went into a loud stage whisper to demand that the very rich "pay their fair share" of taxes.
In all the speech, pool didn't detect any pitch for 2024 and certainly no allusion to the Trump indictment.
The president shook hands and chatted with people in the audience. Pool is heading to the motorcade.
Right at the end, DJ Judd of CNN asked the president whether he has spoken to AG Garland.
Biden replied: "I have not spoken to him at all and I'm not going to speak with him. And I have no comment on that."
At 1:56 pm motorcade is rolling for airport.
From the WH:
In attendance for the President and the First Lady's remarks on how career-connected learning and workforce training programs are preparing students for good-paying jobs in North Carolina – and nationwide – that are being created as a result of the President's Investing in America Agenda:
Students and pre-apprentices in electric vehicle manufacturing and maintenance, faculty, partners, union representatives, and local elected officials.

Marine One landed at 2:54 pm at Pope Airfield Landing Zone. This is part of Fort Liberty where POTUS has his next event: a meeting with military families and remarks.

Travel pool report 10 - event arrival
At 2:10 pm the motorcade arrived at the venue for the remarks. It's a long, low red brick building called the Hercules Fitness Center.
Pool was not in a position to see Biden exiting the Beast.
Inside a huge gym is thronged with uniformed military and some family members. A band is playing martial music.
Apols for any delays - there is no wifi or reliable cell connection in the Hercules center….
Good news for anyone not here: the event will be broadcast live.

The audience of service members have seats but are all listening while standing.
At 3:57 pm the president took to the podium, greeted by loud cheers.
His remarks are being broadcast in the usual places.

June 9, 202319:57

Travel pool report 18 - wheels down
AF1 was wheels down in JBA at 7:54 pm. No visitors to the press cabin on the short flight. For those curious, the TVs in our section were both set to a golf channel, not the virtually omnipresent CNN of flights past. Same thing initially in the Secret Service agents' cabin although half way through the flight their set switched to CNN — and Trump coverage.



June 9, 202320:12

POTUS and FLOTUS disembarked at 8:07 pm and entered the motorcade. No gaggling.
