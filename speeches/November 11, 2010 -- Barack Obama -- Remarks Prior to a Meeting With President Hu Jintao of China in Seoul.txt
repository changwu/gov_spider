    President Obama. It's wonderful to see President Hu once again. We were just noting that it's the seventh time we've had an opportunity to meet. And the U.S.-China relationship, I think, has become stronger over the last several years.
We've been discussing a whole range of not only bilateral issues, but world issues. And as two leading nuclear powers, obviously, we have a special obligation to deal with issues of nuclear proliferation. As two of the world's leading economies, we've got a special obligation to deal with ensuring strong, balanced, and sustainable growth.
I am very much looking forward to hosting President Hu in Washington. And in the meantime, we have created a structure, a Strategic and Economic Dialogue, in which our teams have been working on a whole range of issues. And we're seeing significant progress.
So I look forward to this meeting, and I'm glad to see you again.
President Hu. The Chinese side stands ready to work with the U.S. side to increase dialogue, exchanges, and cooperation so that we can move forward the China-U.S. relationship on a positive, cooperative, and comprehensive track.
I'd like to thank President Obama for inviting me to visit the United States early next year. The competent departments in our two countries are making preparations for the visit. I hope and do believe that the visit will be successful.
This evening the G-20 Seoul summit will be opened. I believe that with the concerted efforts of all the parties, the summit in Seoul will produce positive outcomes.
