    The President has decided to severely reduce our development assistance program in Afghanistan below levels projected for the fiscal years 1979 and 1980. The President has also decided to terminate a military training program that was in the planning stages. These decisions have been taken in the light of an ongoing review of our relations with Afghanistan and the policies with that government. Only small developmental assistance programs that are already under way and that address the needs of the least privileged sectors of Afghan society will continue.
