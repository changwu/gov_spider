    Today, First Lady Melania Trump visited the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to learn more about the opioid epidemic in Ohio and visit with some of their young patients.
Mrs. Trump was greeted by the CEO of Cincinnati Children's, Mike Fisher, and Chairwoman Jane Portman. The First Lady then received a briefing from Cincinnati Children's doctors about the many negative effects opioids have on newborns, particularly neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).
After the briefing, Mrs. Trump visited an activity room and spent time playing with children at the hospital. The First Lady brought valentines and coloring books for each of them. During her visit, Mrs. Trump also met with a child who overcame a serious illness and is now part of Cincinnati Children's champion family group.
"Thank you Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center for a very warm and informative visit. I am so grateful for your continued research on combatting opioid abuse and for all you are doing for your patients," said First Lady Melania Trump. "Children will always be my top priority, and I appreciated the opportunity to visit with the young patients today and witness firsthand their strength and spirit."
