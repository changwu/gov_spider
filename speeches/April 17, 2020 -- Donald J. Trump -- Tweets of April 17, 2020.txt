Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading....Retweets: 87781Favorites: 312405

....in January and February, as the Virus spread globally? Why did the W.H.O. wait as long as it did to take decisive action? Lanhee Chen, Hoover Institution Fellow @FoxNewsRetweets: 29886Favorites: 119129

Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!Retweets: 52856Favorites: 191980

Governor Cuomo should spend more time "doing" and less time "complaining". Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking! We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with....Retweets: 32299Favorites: 142259

....testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help and equipment than any other state, by far, & these great men & women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action!Retweets: 21284Favorites: 96018

Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also, don't forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!Retweets: 31293Favorites: 124140

Cuomo ridiculously wanted "40 thousand Ventilators". We gave him a small fraction of that number, and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile!Retweets: 25774Favorites: 127520
