    Ladies and gentlemen:
Foreign Minister Saqqaf of Saudi Arabia and Foreign Minister Fahmy of Egypt, Dr. Kissinger, and I have just had an extended and very constructive discussion with regard to our achieving the goal of a permanent peace in the Mideastern area.
With regard to the various steps that have been taken--the first of which, of course, was the disengagement on the Egyptian front--the immediate problem that concerns us all is to obtain disengagement on the Syrian front.
The two Foreign Ministers are here representing not only their own governments but also four heads of state, as they will indicate, and at the request of the foreign ministers conveying the requests of the heads of government, we believe that steps should now be taken to get the talks begun between the Syrians and the Israelis with regard to disengagement.
Consequently, at their request, I have asked Dr. Kissinger, when he completes his trip to Mexico City, to go to the Mideast again where he will meet with the Syrians and with the Israelis, with the objective of getting talks started with regard to the problem of disengagement on the Syrian front.
In addition to that, we discussed other matters of mutual concern having to do particularly with the need to have a permanent settlement in the Mideast. And I would say--and I would allow, of course, each of them, or would ask each of them to comment as they see fit with regard to the point I will be making now--that the goal of all governments, these two governments with which we have had very friendly relations in recent times and some over a longer time, the goal of our governments is to have not simply a temporary settlement but a permanent settlement, with normal relations, economically, diplomatically, and in other ways in that area of the world and with all of the countries of that area of the world.
And as our senior guest, we will call on the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia to say anything he would like.
Mr. Saqqaf.
