    Congratulations to the hard working members of Local S6 on approving a new contract that ensures they have a voice in their workplace, employment security, and a good future for Maine jobs. Their inspiring show of solidarity and integrity forged a better and more equitable agreement for themselves and their families, and I am proud to stand with them as they get back to work building the ships that keep our U.S. Navy and service members safe. In standing up for what is right, the Local S6 members showed the power of their collective voice and the power of unions to ensure workers get a fair return for their work.
