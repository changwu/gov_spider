    
4 options left—each one as bad as the next.
The Republican presidential field has narrowed to four, and a terrifying picture is coming into focus. The handful of remaining candidates all hold the same backward views on LGBT equality, women's rights, health care—and just about everything else.
And each of their records is as bad as the next. Here are just a few highlights from the 2016 Republican lineup:




    Introduced a bill that would bar refugees from countries "with active terrorist presence" from entering the United States
  
Voted to block legislation that would let students refinance their federal loans and against a bill to cap interest rates on federal student loans

    Led a filibuster in the Senate to stall gun reform after the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut
  
Repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood

Ohio Governor John Kasich



Defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio and enacted 16 restrictions on abortion
Signed a union-busting bill that limited the ability of public workers to collectively bargain for better conditions the same week that Governor Scott Walker did the same in Wisconsin
Supported an Ohio constitutional ban on same sex marriage

    Signed laws making it harder for Ohioans to vote?
  

Senator Marco Rubio



Argued that programs like Social Security and Medicare have "weakened us as a people"
  
Wants to gut federal highway funding by as much as 80 percent, while phasing out the dedicated mass transit funding that is critical for working Americans
Voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act—a law to help ensure equal pay—and against allowing workers to earn paid sick to specifically address their family's health needs
Voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA)—a bill that would keep people from losing their jobs simply because of their gender identity or sexual orientation

Donald Trump



Wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States
Proposed a $227,000 tax cut for people in the top 1 percent, adding $12 trillion to the deficit
  
Wants to build a wall between Mexico and the United States and deport 11 million immigrants
Willing to shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood


No matter who the Republicans choose as their presidential nominee, that person would:

Repeal the Affordable Care Act
Defund Planned Parenthood
Oppose the Wall Street reforms in Dodd-Frank
Give the wealthy huge tax breaks
Oppose executive actions that keep immigrant families together

There's no telling which Republican will emerge as the party nominee, but one thing is clear: We can't let him anywhere near the White House.
