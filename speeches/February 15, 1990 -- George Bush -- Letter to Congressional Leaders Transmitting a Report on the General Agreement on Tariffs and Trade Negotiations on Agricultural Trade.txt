    Dear Mr. Chairman:
As required under section 4301 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, I am enclosing a report on the status of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations concerning agricultural trade. The report contains information on the progress that has been made to date in the negotiations, the general areas of disagreement, the anticipated date of completion of the negotiations, and the changes in domestic farm programs that are likely to be necessary on conclusion of the negotiations.
I certify that significant progress has been made in the negotiations, and that implementation of the marketing loan program described in subsection (b)(1) would harm further negotiations, and that implementation of the export enhancement program provided for in subsection (c)(1) would be a substantial impediment to achieving a successful agreement under the GATT.
I understand that Ambassador Hills (the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative) has consulted with your committee about this certification.
Sincerely,
George Bush
