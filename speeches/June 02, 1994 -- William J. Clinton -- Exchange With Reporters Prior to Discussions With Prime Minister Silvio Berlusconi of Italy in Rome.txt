    Q. Mr. President, North Korea's being very threatening—making more statements about— the talks that you've undertaken—talks of tough sanctions. What do you say to that?
The President. We're going to have a question period, I think, afterward. The Prime Minister and I will make statements and then answer questions. I'd rather answer questions then.
Q. Any general impressions so far—just about how things are going?
The President. It's been a very good trip so far. I've been very impressed, pleased with the reception, pleased with the support for the United States.
