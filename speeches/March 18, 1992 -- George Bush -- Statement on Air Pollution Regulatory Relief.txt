    I am today announcing a series of steps that will help clean up air pollution in this country and, at the same time, will promote jobs by reducing regulatory costs to automobile companies and other major transportation industries.
One of these steps, our "cash for clunkers" program, will allow States and industries to buy old, high-polluting cars, take them off the road, and use the resulting pollutant reductions to satisfy Federal clean air standards. This is just one example of the innovative, market-based approaches to pollution reduction that have been pioneered by our Environmental Protection Agency. The result is a cleaner, healthier environment and a more competitive economy.
These and other regulatory changes being announced today should provide major benefits to the economy.
