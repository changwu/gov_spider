    I condemn in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack on the Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra. This barbarous act was clearly aimed at inflaming sectarian tensions among the peoples of Iraq and defeating their aspirations for a secure, democratic, and prosperous country. I join Iraq's leaders in calling on all Iraqis to refrain from acts of vengeance and reject Al Qaida's scheme to sow hatred among the Iraqi people and to instead join together in fighting Al Qaida as the true enemy of a free and secure Iraq.
At the Prime Minister's request, the coalition has dispatched a rapid reaction force to Samarra to assist Iraqi forces in guarding the mosque and restoring calm and security to the area. The United States also stands ready to help the Iraqi people rebuild and restore this holy shrine. I call upon the international community and Iraq's neighbors to do everything in their power to help Iraq's Government and people combat the terrorists, especially in stopping the flow of foreign terrorists into Iraq. Those responsible for this outrage must be found and brought to justice. The United States stands by the Iraqi people in this difficult moment and remains fully committed to helping all Iraqis realize their dreams of a peaceful future.
