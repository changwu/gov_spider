    Tony has served at the highest levels of government for two decades. In his time as Deputy National Security Advisor, Tony has built bridges across the interagency community to forge consensus on a broad range of challenging policy issues. He knows firsthand the critical contribution of expertise and leadership that agencies and their staffs bring to bear in shaping our foreign policy.
Tony has been a tremendous colleague and friend as long as I've known him, dating back to 1994. His experience, calm demeanor, inclusive approach, keen intellect, and excellent judgment make him an exceptionally qualified nominee for Deputy Secretary of State. I will sorely miss having his counsel only a short few feet away, but, if he is confirmed by the Senate, I know he will share his remarkable talents with the State Department, continue to play a leading role in representing the United States abroad, and shape our foreign policy to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities we face today.
