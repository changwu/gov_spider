    Sen. Rand Paul today announced his plan to defeat and defund Planned Parenthood. Next week, Sen. Paul will seek to strip Planned Parenthood of its taxpayer funding, which totaled roughly $528.4 million dollars in 2013 - 2014. Sen. Paul will use all legislative vehicles at his disposal in order to ensure there is immediate action on this proposal.
"I am more appalled than ever by Planned Parenthood's complete disregard for the sanctity of human life. The recent revelation that this taxpayer-funded organization is selling body parts of the unborn further proves that this agency deserves our scorn not our tax dollars. I plan to do whatever I can to stop them and will introduce an amendment to pending Senate legislation to immediately strip every dollar of Planned Parenthood funding," Sen. Paul said.
