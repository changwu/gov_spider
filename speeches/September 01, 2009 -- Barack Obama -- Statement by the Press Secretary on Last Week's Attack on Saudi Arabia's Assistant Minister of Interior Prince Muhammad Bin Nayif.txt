    The U.S. Government strongly condemns the cowardly attack late last week against Saudi Arabia’s Assistant Minister of Interior Prince Muhammad Bin Nayif. Al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the attack, which was unsuccessful. Prince Muhammad has been a courageous leader of Saudi Arabia’s fight against al-Qa’ida, and we are very thankful that Prince Muhammad escaped this attack with only minor injuries. The President has extended his best wishes for a full recovery to Prince Muhammad. The attempt on the life of Prince Muhammad underscores the continued threat posed by al-Qa’ida and the importance of strong counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and our regional partners. The President has discussed security cooperation in all of his interactions with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, as they both share a firm commitment to dismantle the al-Qa’ida organization and to prevent it from carrying out its murderous agenda.
