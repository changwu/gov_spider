    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and 3 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5255 which reauthorizes the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. However, the Administration strongly objects to the nearly fivefold increase in the funding authorization for the Foundation provided by H.R. 5255, and will seek amendments in the Senate to eliminate this increase.
Chartered in 1985, the Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established to attract private sector funding to complement the activities of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act authorized "seed money" totaling $1 million over a period of ten years. The legislative intent was that the Foundation would become self-sustaining.
The Foundation, however, has received ever-increasing amounts of Federal moneys. In 1988, the ceiling on Federal funding was increased to $5 million for each of fiscal years 1988 through 1993, and H.R. 5255 would increase the amount to $15 million for FY 1991, to $20 million for FY 1992, and to $25 million for FY 1993.
