    The President. Good afternoon. Well, if ever there was a doubt about the importance of exercising democracy's most fundamental right, the right to vote, yesterday put it to rest. No American will ever be able to seriously say again, "My vote doesn't count."
The American people have now spoken, but it's going to take a little while to determine exactly what they said. The process for that is in motion, and the rest of us will have to let it play out.
I want to congratulate Vice President Gore and Governor Bush on a vigorous, hard-fought, truly remarkable campaign.
Thank you very much.
Conversation With Vice President Gore
Q. Mr. President, did you advise the Vice President to rescind his concession last night?
The President. No, sir. I didn't talk to him about it at all, one way or the other. I talked to him afterward.
We had a great talk later, when the situation was as it is now, and we were laughing. We had a—he was in a good humor. He talked— we talked about the unpredictability of life and how he'd done all he could, and he was pleased that he was ahead in the popular vote at the time. I don't know what the latest totals are. And we had a very good talk. And he congratulated Hillary, and they had a nice little visit.
But I was just like you last night—I was a fascinated observer. Thank you.
