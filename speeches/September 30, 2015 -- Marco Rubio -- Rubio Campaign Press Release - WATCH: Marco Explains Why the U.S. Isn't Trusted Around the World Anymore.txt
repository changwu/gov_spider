A couple things are happening with Russia under Putin. One is this kneejerk reaction: They're going to be against whatever America wants. But the second is he wants to reposition Russia as a geopolitical force equal to the United States. . . . He's going across to the counties in the Middle East and he's saying, look, the Americans broke the Middle East and now they're leaving, and they're unreliable. So we're going to step in and we're actually going to fight ISIS, we're really going to do it.
But his real goal is to protect Assad — keep Assad in power and increase his leverage in the region. And that's exactly what he's achieving by what he's done now over the last 48 hours: not just repositioning military assets within the territory of Syria, but also going to the United Nations and saying to the world that Russia, under Vladimir Putin, they're going to be the ones that lead the anti-ISIS coalition.
It really diminishing America both geopolitically in the region, but ultimately in the eyes of allies and others around the world.
