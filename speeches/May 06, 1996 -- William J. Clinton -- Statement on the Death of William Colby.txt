    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of former Director of Central Intelligence William Colby. Through a quarter century at the CIA, William Colby played a pivotal role in shaping our Nation's intelligence community. A dedicated public servant, he ably led the Agency through challenging times. He made tough decisions when necessary, and he was always guided by the core values of the country he loved. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends in this time of sorrow and grieving.
