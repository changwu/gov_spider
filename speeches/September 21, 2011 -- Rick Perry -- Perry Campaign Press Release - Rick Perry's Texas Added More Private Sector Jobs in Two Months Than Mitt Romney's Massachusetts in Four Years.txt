    AUSTIN — In his second false, desperate attack of the day, a flailing Mitt Romney helped expose his near worst-in-the-nation jobs record and his job-killing RomneyCare plan.
The fact is that Rick Perry's Texas created more private sector jobs in the past two months than Mitt Romney's Massachusetts did during his entire four years as governor.
Romney's state was one of the worst in job creation during his term, ranking 47th in the nation.
"Being 47th in job creation and killing 18,000 jobs with RomneyCare is not a record to brag about," said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan. "Under Gov. Perry, Texas added more private sector jobs in the past two months than Massachusetts did in four years under Mitt Romney. During those four years, Rick Perry's Texas added nearly 20 times as many private sector jobs as Mitt Romney's Massachusetts despite having only three and a half times as many people."
While Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts (Jan. 2003 — Jan. 2007):
