Travel pool report 4 - walking into museum
The president and First Lady Jill Biden, wearing a dark suit and dress, walked hand in hand along a red carpet to enter the Hiroshima Memorial Museum. Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and First Lady Yuko Kishida met them along the way and they talked briefly, unfortunately too far away for pool to hear.
The rain has stopped and the sky is lifting, bringing sharper focus to the domed building at the end of the park that was at the epicenter of the A-bomb but survived structurally intact and is now the symbol of that day.
Pool is holding.

Travel pool report 5 - debt ceiling talks
The White House has this update on "steady progress" in the debt ceiling talks. The call between the president and his team lasted 20-30 minutes, Press Sec Jean-Pierre says.
From a White House official,
"The President requested and received an update this morning from his designated negotiating team on progress being made in their talks on Capitol Hill to arrive at a bipartisan budget framework and ensure that Congress acts in time to avoid default. The President's team informed him that steady progress is being made. The President directed his team to continue pressing forward for a bipartisan agreement and made clear the need to protect essential programs for hardworking Americans and the economic progress of the past two years as negotiations head into advanced stages. He remains confident that Congress will take necessary action to avoid default."

Travel pool report 6 - wreath laying and picture and tree
At 12:05 pm the president and the other G7 leaders laid large white flower wreaths (your pooler is not much of a horticulturist) at the Cenotaph. They then paused for a moment before walking back down a short flight of stairs for the official G7 photo, using the Cenotaph as the background.
Next, the leaders all retuned to the Cenotaph and appeared to be getting a tour.
At 12:15 the president is helping to plant a tree in the park - an event which is closed press. Pool is holding.

Travel pool report 9 - G7 lunch/lack of pool access
Per the schedule, the president is now at the G7 lunch in the Grand Prince hotel.
A "pool" has assembled to go into the top of that. However, the rules are such that each country's pool consists of a sole journalist and in our case a decision had been taken to make that a photographer, so you will not get a pool report from inside the room.
Pool has asked for White House comment on reports that President Zelensky is coming to Hiroshima. Also asking whether the president met with any A-bomb survivors while at the memorial and will let you know if I hear anything new on either front.

A senior administration official says "the President and G7 leaders met one survivor during their tour of the Peace Museum. This was inside the museum before the wreath laying."To be clear, this meeting with the "hibakusha," as survivors are known, took place out of sight of your pool.

Travel pool report 11a - A-bomb survivor name (and more)
While pool continues to hold during the president's closed door G7 meetings at the Grand Prince hotel, sharing these details on the peace park event that were sent out by Japan's foreign ministry. Notably there is the name of the survivor: Keiko Ogura. We also learn that the president and other leaders "deepened their understanding of the reality of the atomic bombings and joined their hearts in consoling the souls of lost lives. The G7 leaders reiterated their position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone its use are inadmissible."
H/t radio pooler Scott Detrow of NPR.
From the Japan MFA:
2. The G7 leaders visited the Peace Memorial Museum together, and in addition to the Prime Minister himself explaining the exhibits, the G7 leaders also exchanged words with Ms. OGURA Keiko, hibakusha (an atomic bombing survivor). H/t radio pooler Scot
3. After the visit, Prime Minister KISHIDA and other G7 leaders were escorted to the Cenotaph for the Atomic Bomb Victims by Mr. YUZAKI Hidehiko, Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture, and Mr. MATSUI Kazumi, Mayor of the City of Hiroshima. They laid a wreath at the Cenotaph, and offered a silent prayer with the support of junior high and high school students in Hiroshima.
4. After hearing the explanation about the Atomic Bomb Dome by Mayor MATSUI, the G7 leaders, together with Prime Minister KISHIDA, planted a cherry tree that survived the atomic bombing (Somei-Yoshino) in the park, as a symbol of the aspiration for peace and the G7 leaders' will to unite for achieving peace.
5. Through their visit to the Peace Memorial Park, the G7 leaders deepened their understanding of the reality of the atomic bombings and joined their hearts in consoling the souls of lost lives. The G7 leaders reiterated their position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone its use are inadmissible. We are convinced that this visit became an opportunity to confirm G7's commitment to the realization of a world without nuclear weapons.

Travel pool report 15 - landing
Marine One landed on Miyajima Island at 6:02 pm. POTUS disembarked and entered a new motorcade. At 6:09 we are rolling and headed to the shrine.
Bit of color:
On the five minute flight we overflew a calm sea dotted with forested islands. What looked like naval vessels were stationed on the silvery water. Miyajima itself is hilly, densely wooded and altogether lovely.
Several of the island's famous deer gathered at the LZ as Marine One came in. They were not only apparently undisturbed by the noise and rotor Wash but were gamboling about.

Travel pool report 17 - shrine visit + POTUS leaving dinner early
Shrine â€”
The G7 leaders arrived at the shrine at about 6:23 pm.
The shrine is an extensive complex of low slung wooden pagodas painted an orangey red. It is built on the shore of the island.
Pool - one print reporter, one photographer and one TV camera were allowed from the White House pool - is stationed on a platform. We were all shoeless in conformance with the etiquette here.
A group of about 10 men were seated under a small pagoda playing traditional Japanese instruments that make a haunting/slightly dirge-like whistle sound, interspersed with occasional drum beats.
On arrival, President Biden was chatting with EU Commission President von der Leyen. Pool couldn't hear what they said. British PM Sunak was laughing. French President Macron winked at someone in the press pack.
The leaders walked through the shrine complex and stopped on the wooden jetty facing the renowned Torii gate â€” a cerimonial/spiritual gate at Shinto shrines - that stands in the shallow sea here.
The leaders posed for their official summit photo.
After, they spent a few more minutes chatting and laughing. Chancellor Scholz wandered off to the end of the jetty but no one followed him and he came back. PM Sunak could be heard exclaiming loudly how "lovely" it was. The leaders then went over to listen to the traditional music before heading off, admiring the sights. The president spent most of this part of the walk chatting with PM Trudeau.
Dinnerâ€”
The leaders are now having dinner. The president arrived at that at about 6:55 per the White House. There was no pool spray.
Press Sec Karine Jean-Pierre said the president will leave the dinner early, although he is attending some of it. Then the "plan" is to receive an update from his debt ceiling negotiation team back in Washington where it is now morning, she said.
Here are three lists from the White House for you.
