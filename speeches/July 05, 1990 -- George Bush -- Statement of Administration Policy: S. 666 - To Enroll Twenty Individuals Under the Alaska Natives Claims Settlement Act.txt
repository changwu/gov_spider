    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Murkowski (R) Alaska)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 666. Title I of the bill would enroll 20 individuals under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) who do not meet the prescribed eligibility requirements. Statutory enrollment of these individuals would set an undesirable precedent for such enrollment of similar individuals. It would also dilute the value of the settlement for those currently enrolled under ANCSA.
The Administration also opposes title II of S. 666, entitled the "Admiralty Island National Monument Act." This title provides for a land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Kootznoowoo Native Village Corporation on terms that would not ensure fair compensation to the United States.
