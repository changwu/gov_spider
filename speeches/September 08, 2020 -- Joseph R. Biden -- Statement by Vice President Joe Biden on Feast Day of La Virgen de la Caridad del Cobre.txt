    On this feast day of la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Jill and I pray that the love and compassion "Cachita" inspires will fill the hearts of believers around the world.
Like so many, our faith serves as the bedrock of our life â€” humbling and grounding us in fortunate moments, and providing comfort and purpose in the darkest of times. This challenging moment for our nation and the world is an especially stark reminder of how vitally important it is for everyone to be able to live and practice their faith freely. That's why I will always stand strong in defense of religious freedom around the world.
Today, Jill and I join all those who pray and pay devotion to the Patroness of the Cuban people. We stand with those who seek a future in which the Cuban people are free to determine their own destiny. And we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to fight for human rights, freedom, and democracy on the island.
