 In town pool report #1 - Mnuchin on the CR/relief talks 
Good morning from the White House.
Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not respond to questions – including whether POTUS will hold a briefing today – after her TV hit on Fox News. She said she would see reporters at her noon briefing.
While pool was waiting for McEnany's TV hit, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin walked by – on his way from the West Wing/Eisenhower Executive Office Building area back to Treasury. He agreed to a quick walk and talk with your pooler.
He said he last spoke to Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week and that he spoke to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby on Tuesday.
He said Senator Shelby and the senator's staff are having meetings on the CR to "get a clean CR and things are moving forward productively so that's really the focus at the moment."
More Mnuchin: "The focus for the moment is two things - one, making sure we get the CR done - those are where I'm having discussions with Pelosi – and obviously working with the Senate on what we'd like to call the targeted bill."
Asked what are the chances of another COVID relief bill this year: "I don't know. We'll see. I hope there is. It's important to a lot of people out there."
There are no public events on the president's schedule today. Pooler will inform you if anything changes.
