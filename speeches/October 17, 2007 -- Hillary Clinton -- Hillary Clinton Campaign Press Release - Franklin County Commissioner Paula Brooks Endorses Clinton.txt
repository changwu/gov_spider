    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to lead our nation from her first day in the White House," Commissioner Brooks said. "She will be a partner for local communities whose concerns too often fall on deaf ears in Washington."
First elected to the Franklin County Board of Commissioners in 2004, Brooks served as President of the Board in 2006. Prior to her election, Brooks served on Upper Arlington City Council from 1996 to 2004 and as its Vice Mayor from 1998 to 2002.
Brooks began her public service in 1975 as an investigator for the Ohio Attorney General. She was promoted to Special Assistant for economic development and tax policy, and directed the Women's Law Project. She later ran a 1,000 member non-profit corporation, served as Chief Legal and Legislative Counsel for the Ohio Department of Liquor Control, and was Assistant Director of the Ohio Department of Administrative Services under Governor Richard Celeste.
In 2000, the Secretary of Defense appointed Brooks as a civilian advisor on the Federal Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS).
Brooks is President of the Board of the Ohio State Bar Foundation and a director of the Ohio Bar Liability Insurance Corporation. She also serves as Secretary of the Board of Trustees for the County Commissioners' Association of Ohio.
"Paula is a true public servant who has devoted her life to helping others," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have her support in bringing our message of change across Ohio."
