Entrepreneurs and family business owners need to be free from overbearing government policy to grow and innovate. Only in a place like America can employees go to being employers, and it's a healthy culture of free enterprise and small business ownership that makes that possible.
Unfortunately, American small businesses, like the broader American economy, are struggling. In recent years, more businesses are being destroyed than created. Breaking out of economic stagnation requires reviving American small businesses and enabling them to do what they do best: create good-paying jobs and new opportunities for American workers. Marco plans to do that by restoring sanity to labor law, cutting taxes for small businesses, keeping regulations and costs low, and more.
In the Senate, Marco has received 100% ratings from the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. He has fought against ObamaCare, tax increases, and other policies that would harm small businesses and their workers.
As President, Marco will:
Enact Comprehensive Tax Reform that Protects Small Businesses

Cut taxes for small businesses to 25%;

Demand Full Repeal of ObamaCare and Its $1 Trillion of Tax Hikes
