We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which if it does happen will likely remain in Singapore on the same date June 12th. and if necessary will be extended beyond that date.Retweets: 22271Favorites: 90098

Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House with his family at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!Retweets: 23873Favorites: 96129

Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!

Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to how to deal with North Korea...and if there was it wouldn't matter. The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!Retweets: 15224Favorites: 62326

The Failing @nytimes quotes 'a senior White House official' who doesn't exist as saying 'even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on June 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.' WRONG AGAIN! Use real people not phony sources.Retweets: 22560Favorites: 84090

With Spies or 'Informants' as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or 'Justice' contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?Retweets: 21850Favorites: 82408

This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven't been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!Retweets: 21733Favorites: 83693

When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O) reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It's been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems Justice FBI & Russia?Retweets: 24081Favorites: 90904
