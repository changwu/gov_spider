My dear Mr. Rubinstein:
I deeply appreciate the kind invitation to lay aside the cares of office and the campaign to join for an evening in the deserved tribute to be paid to two of the worthiest and best loved figures of the American stage, the inimitable Weber and Fields. I do, indeed, believe that such an evening would be as beneficial to me as would the invention of a resoundingly good new joke to the whole country. I cannot be present at the Golden Jubilee banquet, but I will be obliged if you will express my hearty congratulations to the honored guests, and my wishes for an evening of joyous laughter and good-fellowship to their hosts.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Leon J. Rubinstein, Weber & Fields Golden Jubilee Celebration, Hotel Astor, New York City]
