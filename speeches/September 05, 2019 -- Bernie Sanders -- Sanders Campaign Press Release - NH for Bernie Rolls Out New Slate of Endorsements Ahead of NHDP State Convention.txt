    Latest slate includes endorsements of over 50 elected officials, democratic activists, and community leaders from across the Granite State
MANCHESTER, NH - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign announced a slate of 53 endorsements today from local elected officials and community leaders in New Hampshire. The endorsements come just days before the New Hampshire Democratic State Party Convention this Saturday, and build off the 26 endorsements the campaign released earlier this summer, bringing the total number of endorsements to 79.
The endorsers represent a wide swath of activists and leaders from around New Hampshire, including local and state elected officials, leaders from the LGBT, New American, and labor communities, as well as Democratic, environmental, and other activists.
Included in the endorsements are the campaign's co-chairs of NH Labor for Bernie, Janice Kelble of Hooksett and David Holt of Somersworth.
A longtime New Hampshire labor leader, Janice Kelble said, "I was diligent in my research and examination of each candidate running this year. Issue by issue, it was clear one candidate leads on the ideas that matter most to us, and that candidate is Bernie Sanders.
He has stood with labor -- not just in Congress but out on our picket lines -- long before he ever considered running for President. He has always supported strong public services and public service workers. It is for these and many other reasons I firmly support Bernie Sanders and will do everything I can to elect him the next President of the United States."
NH for Bernie State Director Joe Caiazzo, said:"This latest round of endorsements shows we are not only retaining and engaging supporters from 2016, but building new support from a broad swath of leaders from around the state. We are honored to have them on our team, and look forward to working together to win New Hampshire on February 11."
