    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – In response to President Bush's request for an additional $46 billion for war funding, Senator John Edwards released the following statement:
"Today President Bush will ask for another $46 billion from Congress to fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This request comes on top of his original request for $140 billion and confirms that his administration is pressing on with the only Iraq strategy it has ever had—more time, more troops and more war.
"Enough is enough. The American people voted for change last November and now, almost a year later we still have the status quo. Once and for all Congress must stand up to President Bush and pass a funding bill with a timetable for withdrawal. If the president vetoes that bill, Congress must send it back, again and again, as many times as it takes for the president to finally get the message that he can't defy the American people. Every member of Congress who believes this war must end has the moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to send the president one simple message: No timeline, no funding. No excuses."
