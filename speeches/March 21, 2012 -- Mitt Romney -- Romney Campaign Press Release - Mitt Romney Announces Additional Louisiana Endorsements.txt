    Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Louisiana.
"My support in Louisiana is growing because voters in the state know that we must have a president with job-creation experience if we are to turn around our economy," said Mitt Romney. "President Obama came into office with no job-creation experience and the failures of the last three years have been the result. These leaders from Louisiana support my bold pro-growth plan for our country's economy that will put Louisianans back to work and I am proud to have their support."
"Louisiana conservatives are supporting Mitt Romney because he is the only candidate who can defeat President Obama and put in place conservative, pro-growth policies that will fix our economy," said State Senator Conrad Appel. "In order to repeal Obamacare, cut spending, and reduce burdensome regulation, we must have a proven, conservative leader with a record of results. That is why I support Mitt Romney and why so many in Louisiana are supporting his campaign."
