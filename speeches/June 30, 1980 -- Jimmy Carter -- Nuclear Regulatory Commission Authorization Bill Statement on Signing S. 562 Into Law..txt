    I am pleased to sign S. 562, authorizing appropriations to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for fiscal year 1980. This important bill, enacted under the leadership of Senator Hart and Congressman Udall, is a vital step in ensuring the safe operation of America's nuclear plants. It provides the necessary funding and authority for many of the recommendations of the Kemeny Commission concerning the regulation of nuclear reactors, the inspection of facilities and enforcement of regulations, the development of safety and environmental standards and contingency plans, and the conduct of nuclear regulatory research.
S. 562 also authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate regulations to withhold safeguards information from the public. I expect that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will cooperate with other Federal agencies to ensure that its exercise of this authority is carried out in a manner consistent with the responsibilities exercised by other agencies dealing with national security information and restricted data.
