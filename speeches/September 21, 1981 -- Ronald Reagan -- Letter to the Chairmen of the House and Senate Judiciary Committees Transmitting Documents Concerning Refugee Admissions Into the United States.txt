    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am pleased to transmit the information required by the Refugee Act of 1980 in preparation for the consultations on refugee admissions for Fiscal Year 1982. As noted in my July 30 statement, immigration and refugee policy is an important part of our past and fundamental to our national interest. With other countries, we will continue to share in the responsibility of welcoming and resettling those who flee oppression. At the same time, we will seek new ways to integrate refugees into our society without nurturing their dependence on welfare.
The documents transmitted today include proposed admission levels and allocations among groups of special humanitarian concern to the United States or whose admission is otherwise in the national interest. My final determination on admission levels and allocations will be made after taking Congressional and other views expressed at the consultations into consideration.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
