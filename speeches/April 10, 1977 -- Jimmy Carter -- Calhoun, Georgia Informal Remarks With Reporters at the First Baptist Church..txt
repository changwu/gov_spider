    REPORTER. Has it been a happy Easter for you?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, we've enjoyed it; feel at home.
Q. Did you hear about the Russian trawler being seized?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Was that under your orders, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we released several of them, and we just had to draw the line somewhere. We informed the Soviet Embassy this past week that we couldn't continue to release them, that we had to enforce the law.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
