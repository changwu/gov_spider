    Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam made the following statement on tonight's debate in Tampa:
"Mitt Romney again demonstrated that he is ready to be president on day one. Florida has faced more economic hardship than most states, and it is imperative that we have a new president in order for our state's economy to get back on the right track.
Mitt Romney brings both the experience of the private sector and a lifelong record of leadership that will be needed in Washington to bring both sides together to create jobs, cut spending, and maintain our position as the most powerful nation in the world."
