    Congratulations to the workers at Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Georgia, on their vote to unionize and join the United Steelworkers. The men and women at Blue Bird are building electric schoolbuses that are powering America's clean energy future, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and ensuring our kids breathe cleaner air. The fact is, the middle class built America and unions built the middle class. That's why my "Investing in America" agenda is about creating good-paying jobs: jobs that don't require a 4-year degree, jobs you can raise a family on, jobs where you get a free and fair choice to join a union.
Where is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? The workers at Blue Bird and at companies just like it all over the country are proving the future can and will be built in America. And union workers will be a big part of that future.
