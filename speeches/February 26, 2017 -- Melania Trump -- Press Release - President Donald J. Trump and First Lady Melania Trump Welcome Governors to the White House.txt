    The President and the First Lady are looking forward to welcoming and hosting our Nation's governors at the White House this evening for the Annual Governors Ball, to celebrate our Nation's shared values and the key role of States and territories in securing liberty for all Americans. Our collectiveness strengthens us as we collaborate across party lines to make our country great for all Americans.
"I am proud to invite all the governors to the White House for this important annual event," First Lady Melania Trump said. "Tonight, we come together as one Nation, leaving political labels and partisan interests behind."
The theme of the evening is "Spring's Renewal" and the White House has come to life, gleaming with a dazzling, sensorial experience of eternal spring. Mrs. Trump added that, "the scents of jasmine and roses fill the air as we give thanks for this great Nation and the glory of renewal."
