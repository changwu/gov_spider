    Atlanta, GA - Hailing Newt Gingrich as a "true conservative" and "the best man to defeat President Obama," Georgia Representative Lynn Westmoreland became the latest member of the U.S. Congress to endorse Newt's campaign.
"Newt is a true conservative and a proven leader who has focused his campaign on the issues, presenting real solutions to the problems facing our country today," Congressman Westmoreland said.  "He is uniting conservatives across the country and I believe he is the best man to defeat President Obama.  I'm proud to put my support behind Newt and look forward to helping him win back the White House."
"I'm delighted to have the support of my friend Lynn Westmoreland, a true conservative leader for Georgia," Gingrich said today. "Our campaign continues to build momentum and enthusiasm, as voters increasingly understand that we are the conservative choice in this election."
The endorsement is the latest sign of gathering momentum for the Gingrich campaign as it works to consolidate its conservative base in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses. On Wednesday Gingrich met in Arlington, Virginia, with nearly 70 uncommitted conservative leaders to lay out his plans for reclaiming the White House and bringing real change to the American people.  His remarks were met with a "sustained ovation," according to organizers of the event.
