MRS. HOOVER AND I are sad to learn of the unfortunate accident which resulted in the death of Robert Earls and injuries to the other [p.354] members of the saluting battery. We have expressed our sympathy to the mother and father of the boy who lost his life and ask you to convey to the families of those injured our earnest hope that they may speedily recover.
