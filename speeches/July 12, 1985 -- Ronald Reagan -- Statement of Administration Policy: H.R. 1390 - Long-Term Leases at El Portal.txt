    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Coelho (D) California)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R 1390, but will seek changes in the Senate to delete the provisions earmarking the proceeds from leasing federal lands to pay for construction and maintenance of privately-owned facilities.
These costs should be borne by the private developer or the lessees. Any funds necessary for management of the El Portal community should be determined through the appropriations process.
