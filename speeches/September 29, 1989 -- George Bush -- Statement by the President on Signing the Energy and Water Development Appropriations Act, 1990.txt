    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2696, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1990. I want to take this opportunity to commend the Congress for two reasons: first, for keeping funding contained in this Act at acceptable levels; and second, for the speed with which they produced the bill.
The Energy and Water bill is the first fiscal year 1990 appropriations bill to be presented to me for signature. I am pleased that the Congress has completed its work on this bill before the end of the fiscal year. I strongly urge the Congress to complete action on the remaining 12 appropriations bills quickly.
I am also pleased that the Congress and the Administration agreed on several actions that represent investment in America's future and protection of our environment, particularly:
Providing funds for construction of the Superconducting Super Collider. This will be the largest and most ambitious basic research facility ever built. It is a critical part of this Administration's initiatives to strengthen the position of the United States as a world leader in science and technology.
Fully funding atomic energy defense activities. The problems of cleaning up the environment will not be solved overnight, but a major step has been taken. Success in this endeavor will require continuing cooperation between the States, the Congress, and the Administration.
I encourage the Congress to continue to present me with spending bills that recognize important national priorities but keep funding at acceptable levels.
George Bush
The White House,
