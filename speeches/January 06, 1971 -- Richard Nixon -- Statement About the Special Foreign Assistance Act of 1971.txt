    I HEARTILY welcome the prompt and decisive action of the Congress in passing H.R. 19911. The additional foreign assistance funds which I requested only a little over a month ago are vital to the security of the United States and to the success of our foreign policy. They are critical to the success of the Nixon Doctrine and to our efforts to achieve a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
The funds made available by this bill represent major support by the United States for our friends and allies who are assuming greater responsibility in the building of the peaceful and stable world we all seek in the 1970's. They enable us to provide the assistance required by nations which, with our encouragement, are assuming a greater burden for their own defense, and thereby enabling us to reduce our direct overseas involvement.
I am particularly pleased by the consultation and accommodation between Congress and the Administration demonstrated in the legislative history of this bill. America's world leadership depends upon our being able to put aside partisan differences when the national interest is at stake and to band together to demonstrate the unity of purpose so vital to the success of our foreign policy. We have done so on this legislation.
