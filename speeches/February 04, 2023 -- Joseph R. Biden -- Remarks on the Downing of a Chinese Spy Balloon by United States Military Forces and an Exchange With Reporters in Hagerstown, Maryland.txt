    The President. On Wednesday, when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down, on Wednesday, as soon as possible. They decided—without doing damage to anyone on the ground. They decided that the best time to do that was as it got over water, outside—within our—within the 12-mile limit.
They successfully took it down. And I want to compliment our aviators who did it. And we'll have more to report on this a little later.
Thank you.
