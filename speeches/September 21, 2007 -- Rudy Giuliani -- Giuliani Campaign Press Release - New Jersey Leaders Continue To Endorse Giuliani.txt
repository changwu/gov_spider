    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announces the endorsement of more than 20 additional prominent New Jersey residents, including elected officials and key Republicans.
The endorsements join the nearly 300 previously announced endorsements.
"We continue to see that Mayor Giuliani enjoys a tremendous amount of support in New Jersey," said Giuliani's New Jersey Campaign Co-Chairman and former Congressman Bob Franks. "That's because New Jersey voters know Mayor Giuliani will get the same real results for the United States that he did next door in New York City."
The campaign's Honorary Chair in New Jersey, State Senator Tom Kean, Jr., added, "Rudy Giuliani is the proven leader New Jerseyans want as our next President. We have witnessed his leadership firsthand and know he will win New Jersey in both the primary and general elections."
A Republican candidate for president has not won New Jersey in the General Election since 1988.
