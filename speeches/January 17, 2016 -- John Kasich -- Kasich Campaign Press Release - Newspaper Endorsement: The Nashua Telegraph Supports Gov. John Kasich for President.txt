Highlights of the Telegraph's endorsement include:
"We think executive experience matters. For that reason, we lean toward governors, and it's Kasich, we think, who offers the best chance to move the country in the right direction..."
"He opted not to become a congressional lifer, evidence that while Kasich was indoctrinated in the Washington culture, he was not infected by it."
"Kasich is a pragmatic problem-solver who looks first for conservative, common-sense solutions."
"He also understands that our national security is fundamentally tied to our economic growth and that the ocean of government red ink in which Americans are swimming is really a riptide that serves as a drag on the economy and, if not curbed, will eventually undermine the readiness of our military."
"Because he has both an executive and legislative background, Kasich strikes us as the candidate most likely to bridge the executive-congressional divide to reduce the federal debt, strengthen the military and put our economy on sound footing."

Together the three endorsements and four polls in the past week showing him running second in the state, are part of a strong wave of support that continues to build for Kasich in New Hampshire.
