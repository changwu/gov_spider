    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised)
(Senate)(Pell (D) Rhode Island and 18 others)
The Administration is working actively to secure international cooperation to stem the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons (CBW). The Administration supports discretionary authority for the President to sanction countries that use CBW in violation of international law and, accordingly, recommends enactment of H.R. 3033 in lieu of S. 195.
The Administration strongly opposes S. 195 because the bill would mandate the imposition of CBW sanctions, fail to provide necessary Presidential discretion, and impede Administration CBW non-proliferation objectives. Also several provisions in the bill unconstitutionally constrain the President's authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs or provide for the exercise of legislative power outside the constitutionally prescribed manner. For both of these reasons, if S. 195 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed.
