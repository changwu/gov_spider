    Showing organizational strength, Clinton campaign volunteers call neighbors
TULSA, OK - Oklahomans for Hillary turned their focus to campaigning in the Sooner State yesterday as volunteers and staff gathered in Tulsa to call their neighbors in support of Hillary Clinton. The campaign is gearing up for the February 5 Oklahoma primary and state volunteers who previously phone banked for the early state contests are now campaigning in Oklahoma.
"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with the strength and experience to lead our country on day one in the Oval Office," Business leader and State Regent Stuart Price said. "Throughout the state, Oklahomans are campaigning and showing their support for Hillary. We are going to compete and earn every vote in Oklahoma and it starts with the efforts of our volunteers."
In a show of organizational strength and dedication, two different groups of volunteers called community members to express their support and campaign for Hillary. It was the first time most of the volunteers participated in a phone bank for Hillary Clinton and the response was overwhelmingly positive.
Linda Logsdon, a volunteer from Tulsa, brought her friend along who is volunteering after spending time with Hillary when she was in Oklahoma in June. Excited to help out, the friends are dedicating their extra time to the campaign.
"Oklahomans want change and Hillary Clinton is an agent of change who will enact the policies we need to turn our country around," said Linda Logsdon of Tulsa. "I am excited to volunteer for the campaign as we work hard for every vote in Oklahoma."
The Clinton campaign also unveiled a statewide ad yesterday, showing the campaign's dedication to competing in Oklahoma. The ad highlights Senator Clinton's plan to rebuild the country's middle class.
