    Today we received more proof that our economic strategy is working to deepen America's prosperity and widen the circle of opportunity to more American families. Over the past year, personal incomes have increased 5.0 percentâ€” much faster than the rate of inflation. While our economic progress is strong, now is not a time to rest; it is a time to build.
To keep our economy on the right track, we must maintain our three-part economic strategy: We must maintain our fiscal discipline by reserving every penny of the budget surplus until we have strengthened Social Security; we must continue to invest in our people through education, health care, and research and development; and we have to continue to lead the global economy and meet our obligation to the International Monetary Fund.
