    Today, I signed into law H.R. 1585, the "Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act." This legislation requires the U.S. Postal Service to establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail that patrons may use voluntarily to contribute to funding for breast cancer research. Special postal stamps will be made available for this purpose.
Research and the prompt application of research results are the strongest weapons we have against breast cancer. Today, breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. It affects one in eight women in their lifetimes and has touched the families of nearly every American, including my own. But we are making great strides in the study of this disease. Our goal must be to find a cure and a way to prevent breast cancer in the near future.
The bill I am signing into law today builds on this Administration's long history of support for breast cancer research and prevention. Between 1993 and 1997, funding for breast cancer research at NIH increased 75 percent. We will work to ensure that the new funds from this legislation are not used as a replacement for our current commitment. It creates another way for Americans to further support the important research that will make a difference in the lives of millions of families.
