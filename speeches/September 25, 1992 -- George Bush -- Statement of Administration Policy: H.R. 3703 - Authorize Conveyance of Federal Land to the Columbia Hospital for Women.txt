    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/28/92)(House)(Dellums (D) California and 2 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3703. The bill would require the General Services Administration (GSA) to give up one of the last remaining sites that it controls in the District of Columbia that can be used for cost-effective housing of Federal agencies. GSA has already submitted a proposal to Congress to utilize this land as part of a plan to consolidate the State Department's operations. The Administration believes that this plan represents the best use of this property.
