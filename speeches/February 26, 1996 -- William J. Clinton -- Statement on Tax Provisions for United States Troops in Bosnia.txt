    Today, in recognition of the sacrifices members of the U.S. Armed Forces are making in and around Bosnia, I am asking Congress to extend to them a series of special tax rules.
Historically, these provisions—which include extending the time to file returns and certain tax relief for those serving under hostile conditions—have been restricted to individuals deployed in "combat zones." However, the men and women of today's military confront hardships and risks in non-combat missions like the one we have undertaken in Bosnia. I believe the law should be extended to cover them. I look forward to working with Congress to enact these changes as quickly as possible.
