    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Biaggi (D) N.Y. and 16 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4175 as amended by the Senate on October 8th, and if the bill were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior advisers will recommend a veto.
The Senate version of H.R. 4175 is highly objectionable because it would: (1) allow new Title XI ship construction loan guarantee commitments; and (2) continue, rather than phase out, Federal financial assistance for the State maritime schools program.
The Administration would support H.R. 4175 if it were amended to: (1) allow no new commitments under the Title XI loan guarantee program; and (2) authorize appropriations for 1987 in amounts and for activities proposed in the President's Budget â€” $320 million for operating differential subsidies, $5.5 million for research and development activities, and $62.693 million for operations and training activities.
