    At a time when oil and gas prices are rising, the Senate today missed an opportunity to lead America to greater energy independence. The President will continue to fight for the tens of thousands of jobs that are created by opening ANWR, as well as, more importantly, for the need for America to be able to achieve more energy independence that would result from opening ANWR.
The President believes that it's vital for Congress to enact a balanced, comprehensive, energy reform, that reduces our reliance on foreign sources of energy, increases conservation and increases the use of clean, modern and reliable sources of energy. The House has passed comprehensive energy legislation, with strong bipartisan support. And we'll continue, in conference, to work toward achievement of these goals.
