    Chicago, IL -- "Generation Obama," or "GO," is the Obama campaign's newest organizing drive for channeling the energy and excitement of young people supporting the campaign into organized efforts to change America. Nevada's GO chapters in Las Vegas and Reno will help the local Nevada campaign staff to expand their grassroots movement among young activists across the state. Working directly with Obama's Nevada campaign, this group of young supporters will help build support for Obama by networking and organizing other young people and by participating in the campaign's broader field program.
"This campaign has been able to generate amazing enthusiasm and passion among young people in Nevada and across the country. Generation Obama will help turn this enthusiasm into real organizing among young voters in Las Vegas and Reno and will build towards the campaign's overall organization for the January 19th caucuses," said Senator Steven Horsford, a member of Obama's Nevada Steering Committee. "With GO, young activists will be able to come together and join in Senator Obama's movement for change."
Throughout the campaign Barack Obama has enjoyed unprecedented grassroots support and GO is the next step in driving young people to play an active role with the campaign. The GO chapters in Las Vegas and Reno will work with the staff to design their own organizing events in order to most effectively reach their communities and turnout young voters for the caucuses on Saturday, January 19, 2007.
To coincide with Senator Obama's appearance at the Miami Generation Obama launch, the Nevada campaign is hosting local events in Las Vegas and Reno to launch their own GO chapters. The events will highlight the importance of involving young voters in the political process, as well as the need for Generation Obama to act in their communities.
