    Today, as Kamala Harris prepares to go river-to-river on her 3AM Agenda bus tour this week, her campaign in Iowa is launching its "Kamala Captains" program. The organizing initiative will identify the campaign's most active volunteers early in the caucus cycle. "Kamala Captains" will form the core of the campaign's volunteer network in Iowa that will amplify the campaign's efforts to reach into every county and precinct across the state. Eventually, these Kamala Captains will serve as precinct captains for Kamala in their communities.
"We have been blown away by volunteers who are excited to take on leadership roles in their communities in order to get Kamala Harris elected," said Harris' Iowa Organizing Director Erin Phillips. "By talking to their friends and neighbors, Kamala Captains will be engaging in the crucial, on-the-ground work that is the foundation of our campaign's commitment to meeting people where they are."
"Kamala Captains" will take on a range of responsibilities, including hosting events, training volunteers, identifying and persuading new supporters, and training to become precinct captains. Kamala Captains will be given goals to hit so that they can take part in collecting commit-to-caucus cards for Kamala. They will be a key component of Kamala Harris' growing organizing program that is laying the groundwork for success on Caucus Night.
