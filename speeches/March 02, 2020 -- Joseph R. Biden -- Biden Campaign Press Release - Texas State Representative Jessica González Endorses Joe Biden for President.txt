    Today, Texas State Representative Jessica González released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for President because I know that with Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, we'll have a real, fighting chance at finally turning Texas blue -- which means increased access to health care for millions of my fellow Texans, real advocacy for a strong education system for Texan children, and a government at all levels that sees the dignity and worth of every human being, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Joe Biden has been a champion for progressive causes for decades -- but more important than his fighting spirit is his track record of actually making change happen. It's time to nominate Joe Biden and make the most crucial change happen: beating Donald Trump."
State Representative Jessica González represents Texas District 104 in North Texas. She was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2018, and she was one of five women in the Texas House to start the Legislature's first LGBTQ Caucus. Biden has now received over 50 Texas endorsements, including Congressional Black Caucus members Eddie Bernice Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Colin Allred; Congressional Hispanic Caucus members Sylvia Garcia, Filemon Vela, and Vicente Gonzalez; as well as Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Carol Alvarado and State House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
