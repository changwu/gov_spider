    We welcome the Israeli assessment as an essential element in getting the problem solved in Beirut. We are encouraged that the momentum of the peace process continues to build. Ambassador [Philip C.] Habib is in Israel, having left Beirut early this morning, where he will discuss with Israeli officials the several amendments that the Israeli Government has suggested as a result of their Cabinet meeting, as well as other issues in the peace process.
We remain cautiously optimistic that the outstanding issues can be worked out. We are hopeful that there can be rapid movement toward the implementation of the full peace plan. It is our belief that negotiations can best move forward when a cease-fire is carefully observed by all parties.
