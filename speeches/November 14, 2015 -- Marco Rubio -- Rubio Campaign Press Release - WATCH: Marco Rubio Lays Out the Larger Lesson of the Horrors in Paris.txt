The horrific attacks in Paris last night should be a reminder of the scale of the conflict we're in, Marco said this morning. "What we're involved in now is a civilizational conflict with radical Islam," Marco said. "This is not a geopolitical issue where they want to conquer territory, and it's two countries fighting against each other. They literally want to overthrow our society and replace it with their radical Sunni Islamic view of the future."
What drives these Islamist radicals? Why have they set out to destroy the West?
"They do not hate us because we have military assets in the Middle East â€” they hate us because of our values," Marco said. "They hate us because young girls here go to school. They hate us because women drive. They hate us because we have freedom of speech, because we have diversity in our religious beliefs.
They hate us because we're a tolerant society. 
This is a clash of civilizations. And either they win, or we win."
