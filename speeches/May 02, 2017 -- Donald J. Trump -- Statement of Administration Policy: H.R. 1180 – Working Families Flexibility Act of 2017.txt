    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Roby, R-AL, and 17 cosponsors)
The Administration supports H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017. H.R. 1180 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow private-sector employers to give their employees the choice to receive paid time off instead of cash payments for each hour of time for which overtime compensation would otherwise be required. The bill would extend to private-sector workers a choice that public-sector employees have long enjoyed.
H.R. 1180 would help American workers balance the competing demands of family and work by giving them flexibility to earn paid time offâ€”time they can later use for any reason, including family commitments like attending school appointments and caring for a sick child. In addition, H.R. 1180 contains critical protections to ensure employees can continue to choose overtime pay and to prohibit employers from coercing their employees to accept compensatory time instead of overtime pay.
If H.R. 1180 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
