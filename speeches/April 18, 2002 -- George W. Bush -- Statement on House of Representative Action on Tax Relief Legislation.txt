    I commend the House for its bipartisan passage of legislation to make permanent last year's tax relief. Tax relief is right for America, and it has been right for our economy. Taxpayers need to know they can count on continued lower tax rates as they plan and invest for the future. I urge the Senate to act on this measure because failure to do so would penalize every American who pays Federal income taxes.
