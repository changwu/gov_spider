    In his 17 years representing the people of North Carolina in the U.S. Congress, Mike McIntyre has been a strong advocate for our men and women in uniform and a key voice on issues that shape the lives of Americans in rural communities. He's also been an active participant in the annual National Prayer Breakfast, a reflection of his deep faith. Michelle and I thank Congressman McIntyre for his service, and we wish him, his wife Dee, and their two sons the very best in the future.
