    Rev. Adam Pierce says Ron Paul "affords us the only honest opportunity at protecting our civil and religious liberties."
ANKENY, Iowa â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was endorsed today by the Rev. Adam Pierce, Associate Pastor of Buchanan Avenue Baptist Church in Sioux City.
In making his endorsement, Rev. Pierce mentioned he was doing so as a private citizen and not on behalf of the Buchanan Avenue Baptist Church or its congregants.
"As both a veteran and a preacher, I support Dr. Ron Paul because he affords us the only honest opportunity at protecting our civil and religious liberties, which are currently being threatened," said Rev. Pierce, who has been a Baptist pastor for 10 years.
"Dr. Paul offers a balanced approach in every area of government and his voting record is above reproach. Casting a vote for Ron Paul is the only choice we have as Americans to remain the greatest nation in the world and retain our Constitutional foundation," added the pastor.
Rev. Pierce is a proud husband of more than 18 years, and parent to four children ages 3 to 14. He also is an eight-year Navy veteran, E-5/Gunners Mate Guns.
Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers responded, "The Iowa team is pleased to accept the endorsement of Rev. Pierce, who counts military service among his high achievements. We hope his endorsement and others like it will propel Ron Paul to a strong top-three finish in the caucus."
