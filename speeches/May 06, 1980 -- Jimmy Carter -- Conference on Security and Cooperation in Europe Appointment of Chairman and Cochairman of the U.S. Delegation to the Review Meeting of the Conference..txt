    The President today announced his intention to appoint the former Attorney General, Judge Griffin Bell, of Atlanta, Ga., and Max M. Kampelman, Washington attorney and chairman of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, to serve as chairman and cochairman, respectively, of the United States delegation to the review meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be held in Madrid later this year.
In view of the importance which the President attaches to this meeting, he will accord to both Judge Bell and Mr. Kampelman the personal rank of Ambassador for the duration of their assignments.

Representative Fascell and Senator Pell, who are chairman and cochairman, respectively, of the U.S. (Helsinki) Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also served as vice-chairmen of the U.S. delegation to the first CSCE review meeting in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, from October 1977 through March 1978. Ambassador Todman is the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, host country for the 1980 review meeting.
