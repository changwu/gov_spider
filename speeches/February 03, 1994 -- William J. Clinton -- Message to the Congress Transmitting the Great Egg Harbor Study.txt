    To the Congress of the United States:
I take pleasure in transmitting the enclosed report on the Great Egg Harbor River in the State of New Jersey. The report is in response to the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, Public Law 90-542, as amended. The Great Egg Harbor Study was authorized by Public Law 99-590, approved on October 30, 1986.
The study of the Great Egg Harbor River was conducted by a task force made up of representatives of affected municipalities, State and Federal agencies, organizations with river-related interests, and local residents under the leadership of the National Park Service. The National Park Service, together with the task force, identified the outstandingly remarkable resources within the study area, analyzed existing levels of protection for these values, investigated major issues and public concerns, assessed the attitude of riparian landowners, reviewed and analyzed the impact of existing and potential development, and developed alternative plans and management strategies.
The National Park Service determined that 129 miles of the Great Egg Harbor River and its tributaries are eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This is based upon their free-flowing condition and fish, wildlife, botanic, and recreational values.
Eleven of the 12 affected local governing bodies endorsed designation of the eligible river segments. The lone exception, Upper Township on the Tuckahoe River tributary, did not take a position nor did the State of New Jersey.
Perhaps due to this overwhelming support, the 102d Congress proceeded to designation without waiting for submittal of the required report and Presidential recommendation. While a Presidential recommendation is now moot, I am submitting the report to fulfill the requirements of sections 4(a) and 5(a)(93) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
