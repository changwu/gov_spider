    FREEMAN, S.D.â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday issued the following statement in response to the news that a Keystone pipeline was leaking nearly 17,000 gallons of oil:
"This past week, an existing leg of the TransCanada Keystone pipeline leaked almost 17,000 gallons of tar sands oil, threatening to destroy tribal lands in Freeman, South Dakota. The instability of these pipelines pose serious threats to Native American land, our lakes and rivers, and the health of all South Dakotans. These are just some of the many reasons why I have, from Day One, fought against the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Alberta Clipper and opposed fracked oil pipelines throughout the United States."
"I stand with our Native American brothers and sisters in South Dakota and as president will continue to fight with them to protect their native lands from companies who seek to destroy their homes for profit."
