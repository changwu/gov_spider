    Yesterday former Rand Paul adviser Mike Biundo announced that he will join Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign.
Said Biundo, "Governor Kasich has tirelessly crisscrossed New Hampshire and has taken our First in the Nation Primary process seriously. He brings to this race a conservative record of accomplishments and a keen understanding of the issues facing Granite Staters and our nation. I am pleased to join the ranks of former U.S. Senators Gordon Humphrey, John E. Sununu and Congressman Chuck Douglas in supporting his candidacy."
Biundo will serve as a national adviser to Governor Kasich. He previously served as National Campaign Manager for former Senator Rick Santorum's 2012 presidential race before bringing his extensive knowledge of grassroots politics to Mitt Romney's general election campaign as National Deputy Coalitions Director. A native of New Hampshire, Biundo played a key role in Pat Buchanan's 1996 upset victory in the New Hampshire primary election.
Said Kasich, "Mike Biundo is a giant in the field of grassroots organizing and coalitions building. It's a privilege to welcome him aboard in these critical days leading up to the New Hampshire primary election. I like to say that my campaign is like the little engine that keeps coming along, which happens to be Mike's specialty. I have no doubt that he'll be a major asset to us going forward."
