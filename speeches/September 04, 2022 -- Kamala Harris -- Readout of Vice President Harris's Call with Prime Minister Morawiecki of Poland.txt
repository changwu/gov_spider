    Vice President Kamala Harris today spoke with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland. The Vice President recognized Poland's generosity and leadership in hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees and providing critical humanitarian assistance, while also providing vital security assistance to help the Ukrainian people defend their democracy from Russia's ongoing aggression. The Vice President reaffirmed the enduring strength of the U.S.-Polish relationship and efforts to bolster our collective security, including the permanent stationing of the U.S. Army V Corps Headquarters Forward Command Post in Poznan, which President Biden recently announced as the first permanently-stationed U.S. force presence on NATO's Eastern Flank. The Vice President also discussed opportunities to enhance bilateral cooperation on civil nuclear power generation in Poland, which would advance European energy security, support global climate solutions, and create thousands of clean energy jobs in both Poland and the United States.
