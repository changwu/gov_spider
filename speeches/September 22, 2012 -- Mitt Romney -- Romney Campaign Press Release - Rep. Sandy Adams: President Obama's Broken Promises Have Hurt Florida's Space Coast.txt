    Florida Congresswoman Sandy Adams released the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for Securing U.S. Leadership in Space: 
"Because of President Obama's lack of leadership, the world's greatest spacefaring nation is earth-locked, entirely dependent upon the Russian Soyuz for crew access to the $100 billion International Space Station—mankind's largest single investment in science and technology. After President Obama promised to close the gap between Shuttle and Constellation during a local campaign stop in 2008, he broke his promise and cancelled it upon being elected, without any vision or direction for the future, leaving thousands of Floridians without hope. The work done by the dedicated men and women on Florida's Space Coast requires bold and courageous leadership, not excuses and empty promises."
