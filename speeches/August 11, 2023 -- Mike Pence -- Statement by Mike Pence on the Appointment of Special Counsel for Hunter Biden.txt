    Mike Pence issued the following statement at the Iowa State Fair on the Hunter Biden special counsel:
"To be honest, I can't relate to what Joe Biden's son was doing when he was Vice President. When I was Vice President, my son was flying an F-35 for the Marine Corp defending this country. I think it's about time that we saw the appointment of a special counsel to get to the bottom of not only what Hunter Biden was doing, but what the Biden family was doing. The American people deserve answers and I welcome the appointment."
