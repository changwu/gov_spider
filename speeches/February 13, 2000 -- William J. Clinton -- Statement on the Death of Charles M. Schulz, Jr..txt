    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Charles M. Schulz, Jr. On the day that our newspapers print his very last "Peanuts" strip, it is especially poignant that we mourn the passing of Charles Schulz himself. For 50 years, his keen eye, his good and generous heart, and his active brush and pen have given life to the most memorable cast of characters ever to enliven our daily papers. The hopeful and hapless Charlie Brown, the joyful Snoopy, the soulful Linus—even the "crabby" Lucy—give voice, day after day, to what makes us human.
Today, in his final strip, Charles Schulz writes, "Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy...how can I ever forget them...." We can say with certainty that we will never forget them, or their creator, or the many gifts he has given us all.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Jeannie, and their children.
