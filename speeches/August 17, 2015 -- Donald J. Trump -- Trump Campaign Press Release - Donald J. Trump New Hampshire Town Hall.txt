    This Wednesday Donald J. Trump will be hosting a Town Hall Meeting at the Pinkerton Academy (5 Pinkerton St., Derry, NH). We expect a big crowd, so make sure you RSVP.
Doors open at 6:00PM, and the Town Hall will begin at 6:30PM.
There will be an opportunity for Q&A following Mr. Trump's remarks.
We had a great event in Hampton last weekend, with nearly 3000 people coming out to hear Mr. Trump speak! Thank you to everyone who volunteered or attended.
See you Wednesday!
Team Trump
