VP Pool Report #1 - American Rescue Plan event
Hi there,
I'll be your pooler for this afternoon's event with the vice president.
Here is the guidance from the VPOTUS' office:
At 1:45PM EST, the Vice President will drop in a virtual meeting with Americans she has previously met over the first 50 days in office to talk about the passage of the American Rescue Plan. This event in South Court Auditorium will be pooled press.
The event was delayed slightly by the signing of the American Rescue Plan in the Oval Office, which Vice President Kamala Harris attended.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Best,
Megan

The first participant to speak is Marc Perrone, President of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union who thanks the vice president for many provisions but "thank you most especially for the money to reopen schools."
"We are doing a happy dance," MomsRising Executive Director Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner said during exuberant remarks. She also said MomsRising members are thrilled with the extension of the child tax credit.
"Thanks to all the moms who are not just rising but have risen," Vice President Harris quips with a laugh.

VP Pool Report #4a - More participant comments
Ron Busby, US Black Chambers of Commerce President, spoke about the need for capital for small businesses and the importance of the vaccine when it comes to reopening businesses.
The vice president thanked Busby for mentioning the vaccines and promised "more to come" from her and Treasury Secretary Janet Yelled when it comes to capital for small businesses.
Next up is Dr. Samir Balile, Pharmacist at Giant Food thanks the vice president for more funds to deploy vaccines and said:"Enable community pharmacies to do what they do best and that's put shots in arms."
VP Harris thanked him and said community pharmacies bridge a gap in vaccine care that allows people to get vaccines where they do their grocery shopping.
The last two to speak are two small business owners:
Danielle Romanetti, Virginia small business owner of Fibre Space speaks about the fear at the beginning of the pandemic and how to stay open, keep her employees safe and keep herself afloat. Romanetti also addressed schools reopening, sharing her concern that her Northern Virginia schools may not open in the fall because of the CDC recommendations for schools.
She also mentions her Alexandria, Virginia community's proximity to DC:
"As a small business inside the beltway, we are very personally impacted by the change of every administration and I can say Alexandria feels refreshed by this new Administration."
The vice president responds with anecdotes about the people she met at Fibre Space - workers afraid to go to work at the beginning and a mom who had to balance virtual schooling with going to work everyday.
The last participant to speak is Nadiyah Johnson, Wisconsin small business owner and creator of the Milky Way Tech Hub. She cheers the American Rescue Plan:
"For my community the message is very clear that help is here. What I'm not excited about is the money for vaccines. I hope it will include money for education on vaccines...I think it's important to leverage Black and brown vendors in this space."
