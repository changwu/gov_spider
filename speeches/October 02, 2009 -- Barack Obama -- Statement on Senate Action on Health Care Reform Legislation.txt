    Thanks to the unyielding commitment of Senator Baucus and members of the Senate Finance Committee, we have reached another milestone in our effort to pass health insurance reform. Over the past 2 weeks, the committee has engaged in long hours of thoughtful deliberation and vigorous debate. They have considered hundreds of amendments and incorporated many of the best ideas from both parties. And they have shown a spirit of civility, a seriousness of purpose, and a willingness to compromise that embodies our democratic process at its very best.
The Finance Committee's work is the culmination of tireless efforts over the better part of this year by the five committees and many Members of Congress involved in health reform: holding numerous hearings and bipartisan meetings; reaching out to stakeholders across the spectrum; and striving to find common ground. As a result of this work, we are now closer than ever before to finally passing reform that will offer security to those who have coverage and affordable insurance to those who don't. We have a long way to go, but I am confident that as we move forward, we will continue to engage with each other as productively as the members of the Finance Committee and will get reform passed this year.
