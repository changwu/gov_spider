    My grandfather fled Germany ahead of WWII and found a home in the United States.
For the rest of his life, he felt he and our family owed this country a deep debt of gratitudeâ€”and he wanted to make sure we never forgot it. On July 4, 1986, he wrote this letter to my brothers and me:

"The Statue of Liberty was the visible image of my new life ahead! And what magnificent opportunities that new life afforded me: a superior education, a stimulating professional life, significant recognition for purported achievements and contributions, and material comfort ... nowhere else could this have been matched.
"Please, do not forget! You owe a little bit extra beyond the debt all owe to those who conceptualized, established and preserved this remarkable nation. It is far from perfect, even if it is the best devised by humankind. Do a little something to make it even better!"
