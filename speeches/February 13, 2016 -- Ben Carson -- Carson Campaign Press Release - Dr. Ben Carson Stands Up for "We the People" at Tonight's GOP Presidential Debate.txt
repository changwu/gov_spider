    Greenville, South Carolina — February 13, 2016 — At tonight's CBS News Republican presidential debate in Greenville, South Carolina, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, showed that when he speaks, people listen. He reminded viewers they do not have to settle for business as usual in Washington, but can choose a candidate who will always represent the greatness and goodness of the American people.
On the stage, Dr. Carson offered voters a view of a future commander-in-chief with judgment — honed in the real world solving unprecedented, complex problems — that supersedes political rhetoric or experience. The viewing audience also saw that Dr. Carson's readiness for the White House is coupled by his decency. As other candidates engaged in bickering, Dr. Carson called for healing across this land.
Throughout this election, Washington insiders have run their campaigns based on D.C. values, but Dr. Carson has stayed true to faith, integrity and accountability. While other candidates have talked about improving the country, Dr. Carson has saved lives, protected the unborn, helped our veterans heal, provided inspiration to young people in impoverished neighborhoods, offered common-sense solutions to this country's challenges and stood proudly for American values.
Tonight, voters in South Carolina and across the country saw for themselves a compelling presidential candidate with quiet strength, an authentic personal faith and strong moral conviction who is accountable to all and beholden to none.
