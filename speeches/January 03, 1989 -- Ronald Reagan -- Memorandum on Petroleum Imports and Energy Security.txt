    Memorandum for the Secretary of CommerceSubject: Effects of the Imports of Petroleum on the National Security
I have considered your December 1, 1988, report under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), concerning the effects of the imports of petroleum on the national security.
I approve your finding that petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security. However, based on your recommendation that takes into account my detailed program to improve energy security, transmitted to the Congress on May 6, 1987, I determine that no action to adjust oil imports under Section 232 need be taken.
