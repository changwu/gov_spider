    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (MFCMA), as amended, (Public Law 94265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith a Governing International Fishery Agreement (GIFA) consisting of an Agreement Amending the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States of America of September 10, 1982 (the "Agreement") signed at Washington on November 10, 1987. This Agreement amends to conform to U.S. law and extends for the period of two years from December 31, 1987, until December 31, 1989, the existing GIFA with Japan. The exchange of an Agreement, together with the present GIFA, constitutes a GIFA within the requirements of Section 201(c) of the Act.
This GIFA is one of a series negotiated in accordance with the MFCMA since 1976. The amendment and extension of the GIFA would ensure the continuation of mutually beneficial joint ventures between the U.S. and Japanese fishing industries in the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Unless the GIFA is extended, these operations will cease, causing significant financial hardship to U.S. fishermen.
I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date, so that it can enter into force before the present GIFA expires on December 31.
