    During their meeting on July 17, 2003, the President and Prime Minister Blair discussed the issue of U.K. nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay.
The President and the Prime Minister have asked American and British legal experts to meet to discuss a range of options for disposition of the British detainees. Pending these discussions, the President has determined not to commence any military commission proceedings against U.K. nationals. The President and the Prime Minister are confident that their experts will be able to agree on a solution that satisfies the mutual interests of the U.S. and the U.K. To this end, we welcome the visit to Washington early next week of a British delegation led by Attorney General Lord Goldsmith.
Similarly, the United States will not commence military commission proceedings against any Australian nationals pending parallel discussions with Australian legal experts next week.
