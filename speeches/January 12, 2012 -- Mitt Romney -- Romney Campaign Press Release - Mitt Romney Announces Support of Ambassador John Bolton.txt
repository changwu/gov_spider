    Mitt Romney announced today the support of Ambassador John R. Bolton.
"I am honored to have John's support," said Mitt Romney. "John has been a staunch defender of U.S. interests and values, both while he was in and out of government. John's wisdom, clarity, and courage are qualities that should typify our foreign policy. I look forward to consulting with him as we campaign to restore America's standing abroad and ensure that this century is an American Century."
"Of all the candidates, Mitt Romney possesses the strongest vision for America's leadership role in the world, and I am proud to endorse him," Ambassador Bolton said. "President Obama has sapped America's credibility abroad, weakened our military and failed to lead on issues vital to U.S. national security. President Obama has left America exposed to ever increasing threats. Mitt Romney will restore our military, repair relations with our closest allies, and ensure that no adversary—including Iran—ever questions American resolve."
