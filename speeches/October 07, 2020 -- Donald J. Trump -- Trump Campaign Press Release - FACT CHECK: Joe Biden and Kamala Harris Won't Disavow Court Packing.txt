    Biden bends to far-left demands to pack the Supreme Court. 
As President Trump makes a third nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, radical Democrats are vowing to "pack the court" with far-left judicial activists if Democrats are given power.
So far, Joe Biden has refused to reject the idea.


"It's a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I'm not going to answer that question," Biden said in an interview with WBAY-TV in Wisconsin.

"What I'm not going to do, and I hope you'll understand, is play the president's game. He wants to change the subject," Biden told WRAL-TV in North Carolina. "I'm not gonna get into that."

"I know you're going to be upset with my answer, but ... if I were to say yes or no to that, that becomes a big issue. That's the headline here," Biden said last weekend. 

Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, has also recently refused to answer questions about court packing despite being willing in the past to ignore historical precedent and add more Justices to the Supreme Court.
Biden's refusal to directly answer the question appears to reverse his long standing opposition to such a move. For decades, Biden denounced court-packing as a "bonehead idea," a "power grab," and "damaging."
So what changed? Biden is now controlled by the radical left who will try to pack the Supreme Court as soon as they get the chance. Biden can't answer the question because he knows the answer is yes.
