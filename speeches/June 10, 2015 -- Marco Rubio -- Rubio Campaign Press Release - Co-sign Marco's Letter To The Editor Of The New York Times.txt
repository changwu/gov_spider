Co-sign Marco's letter to the editor of the New York Times if you agree that all Americans deserve the opportunity to further their education, even if they don't come from a wealthy family.

Student Loans Provide Opportunity to Millions
In the latest story about my background ("Struggles With Finances Track Marco Rubio's Career," June 9), the authors state that I began my career "in a deep financial hole of [my] own making" because I took out student loans to pay for college and law school.
It's true that my parents weren't wealthy enough to pay for my higher education. Like millions of Americans, I had to attend college on federal grants and loans. When I graduated from law school I had close to $150,000 in student debt, which I've only paid off in recent years.
Your article is accurate in its assertion that I do not come from wealth. My father drove the same 1973 Chevy Impala for 20 straight years, owned only two pairs of shoes, and wore the same Seiko watch until the day he died, even though the gold plating had worn off years before. Nonetheless, I truly believe I am a child of privilege, because my parents made it the purpose of their days to ensure that I could live the life they never could themselves, and I was born in the one country where you don't have to come from wealth or power to achieve a better life.
This election is about ensuring everyone, regardless of the family they were born into, has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream in the 21st century. This will be achieved when our economy creates the good paying jobs of the future, and when our higher education system equips all of our people with the skills needed to fill them. That is the message of my campaign, and that will be the purpose of my presidency.
