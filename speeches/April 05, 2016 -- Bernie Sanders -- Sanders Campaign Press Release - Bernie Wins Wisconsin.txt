"We have a path toward victory, a path to the White House," Sanders said at nighttime rally where he began by thanking the people of Wisconsin and looking forward to caucuses in four days here in Wyoming.
He told the 2,000 supporters that the latest victory builds on the momentum of his grassroots campaign. "Momentum is starting a campaign 60 to 70 points behind Secretary Clinton" and "momentum is national polls in the last weeks that had us 1 point up or 1 point down," he told the rally at a University of Wyoming auditorium.
"Momentum is we are defeating Donald Trump by very significant numbers," Sanders added, "and in almost every instance our margin over Trump is wider than Secretary Clinton's."

After Saturday's Wyoming caucuses the next stop in the race for the White House is New York's April 19 primary in the state where the Vermont U.S. senator and Brooklyn native was born and raised.
Sanders' grassroots campaign has been fueled by phenomenal support from more than 2 million donors who continue to set campaign finance records. In March alone, donors contributed $44 million, almost all of it in small amounts averaging less than $30. The total for March was more than any month since the campaign began last April 30 and $15 million more than Clinton raised last month.
Clinton hasn't disclosed the fundraising haul by the super PACs backing her bid with unlimited sums from wealthy donors and corporations. Saying super PACs are part of a corrupt campaign finance system, Sanders has refused to coordinate with the fundraising committees invented after a disastrous decision by the Supreme Court opened the floodgates to unlimited campaign cash coming from billionaires and corporations.
