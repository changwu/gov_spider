    The President. I want to take a brief moment just to say a few words about a tragic event that took place earlier today in Frankfurt, Germany.
I'm saddened and I am outraged by this attack that took the lives of two Americans and wounded two others. I think the American people are united in expressing our gratitude for the service of those who were lost. Michelle and I have their family and their friends in our thoughts and prayers, and we are praying for a speedy recovery for those who were injured.
I want everybody to understand that we will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous act took place and in working with German authorities to ensure that all of the perpetrators are brought to justice.
And we don't have all the information yet, and you will be fully briefed as we get more information, but this is a stark reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices that our men and women in uniform are making all around the world to keep us safe and the dangers that they face all around the globe.
So I think it's fair to say that on behalf of the American people, we want to extend our deepest condolences to these families. And we will give you further updates as we get more information about it.
Okay. Thank you.
Situation in Libya
Q. Anything on Libya, Mr. President?
Q. Was this an act of terrorism, sir?
Q. Will you take a question on Libya?
The President. I will have a chance to take some questions tomorrow. President Calderon from Mexico will be here, and so I'll give you guys a chance to ask a couple of questions on some of these other pressing topics. All right?
Thank you.
