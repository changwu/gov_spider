    The Republican tax plan drains billions of dollars from the surplus before we have done the hard work of strengthening Social Security. First things first. I will insist that we reserve the entire surplus until we have seized this historic opportunity to save Social Security, and veto any bill that doesn't meet that principle. While it is regrettable that this plan survived today, I am heartened by the strong commitment to fiscal discipline and Social Security shown by those who opposed it.
