    It was with deep sadness that I learned of the death of Vincent Foster, who served ably and with distinction as Deputy White House Counsel and was my friend for over 40 years. Hillary and I love his wife Lisa and their three children, and we want to draw them close to our hearts and keep them in our prayers in this painful moment of grief. His family has lost a loving husband and father, America has lost a gifted and loyal public servant, and Hillary and I have lost a true and trusted friend. My deepest hope is that whatever drew Vince away from us this evening, his soul will receive the grace and salvation that his good life and good works earned.
