    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with the provision of Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on progress made during the past 60 days toward reaching a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem.
The intercommunal negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have taken a significant step. Both sides accepted presentation of a United Nations "evaluation" of the status of the intercommunal talks on November 18. The "evaluation," although not a formal proposal, embodies ideas and concepts which may prove useful for the parties in their discussion of outstanding issues.
Following the presentation of proposals earlier this summer by the Turkish Cypriots (August 5) and the Greek Cypriots (September 9), the development of the United Nations "evaluation" signals continuing progress towards a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem. The United Nations, the Special Representative of the Secretary General, Ambassador Hugo Gobbi, and the participating parties are to be commended for their efforts. We hope that both parties will seize the opportunity offered by the United Nations "evaluation" to devote renewed energy to resolving their differences by peaceful negotiation in a spirit of compromise.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
