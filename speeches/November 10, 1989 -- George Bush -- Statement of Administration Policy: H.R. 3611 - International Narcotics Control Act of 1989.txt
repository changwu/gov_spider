    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) - Florida and 36 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3611 which authorizes appropriations for the President's Andean drua initiative.
However, the Administration will seek amendments in conference to:

clarify that the Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF) should not be used solely for anti-narcotics purposes. The SDAF may be used to acquire defense articles for counter-narcotics assistance, but this is only one of several priority demands upon the Fund's resources;  
permit submission of certain reports to Congress on a classified basis to the extent necessary to protect ongoing counter-narcotics programs; and  
eliminate certain earmarking, reporting, and unnecessary notification provisions, which constitute objectionable congressional micromanagement of foreign affairs. Such requirements interfere with the President's authority to conduct foreign relations on behalf of the United States.
