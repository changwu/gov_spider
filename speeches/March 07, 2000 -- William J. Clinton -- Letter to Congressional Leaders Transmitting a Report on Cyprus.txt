    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you a report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period December 1, 1999, to January 31, 2000. The previous submission covered events during October and November 1999.
The United Nations convened 12 days of intensive talks to resolve the Cyprus dispute in early December. United Nations Secretary General Annan reported that both parties engaged seriously on the whole range of issues that divide them. My Special Envoy for Cyprus, Alfred H. Moses, and his team provided critical diplomatic support for the United Nations efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement.
Talks resumed in Geneva on January 31 where United Nations Special Advisor Alvaro de Soto held a series of meetings with both sides. The parties will continue discussions on May 23 in New York. We welcome this important process, and we will continue to work with the United Nations to reach a solution for all Cypriots based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
