    Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"These weak GDP numbers for the second quarter offer yet more proof that our economy is stuck in neutral. It further confirms what too many Americans already know: President Obama's policies aren't working, and they haven't grown the economy or provided relief to the 23 million people still struggling for work. The President says he spends "every waking hour" thinking about the American people. If that's true, then he needs to take seriously these signs of an economic slowdown â€” and he should start by meeting with his own Jobs Council and focusing on solutions instead of politics."
