    "Women, by a large majority, make the financial decisions in a family. They are the ones who go to the grocery store. They make decisions about taking their children to doctors or taking care of their parents, often times their spouse's parents too. They're filling up the car trying to figure out are we going to have enough money to go to summer camp. So it was a blanket statement: she's never worked in her life so she can't speak to the economy. That is so insulting to women." — Congresswoman Kay Granger

HOST: "I want to get your reaction, I mean, you're a woman that works so, I mean, should any woman listening right now that voted for you have no opinion if they don't go to work every day?"
REP. KAY GRANGER: "Let me tell you, that's the most outrageous position... I nearly drove off the road this morning. I was coming to an appointment and I was listening to your show and I was furious, and I am furious. I, for a short time, a couple of years when my kids were very small, I was a stay-at-home mom. Of course, the rest of the time, raising my children. If you don't think that moms, if they're staying home, don't understand the economy? Women, by a large majority, make the financial decisions in a family. They are the ones who go to the grocery store. They make decisions about taking their children to doctors or taking care of their parents, often times their spouse's parents too.
