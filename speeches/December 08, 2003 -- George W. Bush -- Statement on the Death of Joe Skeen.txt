    Joe Skeen was a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly for the people of New Mexico. He led an extraordinary life, from his service in the Navy and the Air Force Reserves to his work and many contributions in the New Mexico State senate and the United States House of Representatives. He was a strong leader of conviction and principle. A good man, he will be missed by his many friends. Laura and I send our condolences to his wife, Mary, and their family and friends.
