    WOODBRIDGE, NJ -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of New Jersey Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within New Jersey's veterans' community.
"New Jersey veterans support John McCain because he has spent his lifetime answering the call to serve a cause greater than his own self-interest," said General Clark Martin (USAF, Ret.), New Jersey Veterans for John McCain Steering Committeeman. "John McCain has worked tirelessly to improve veterans' health care and streamline VA services and will continue to do so as president."
Sen. Phil Haines, a U.S. Army veteran and co-chair of New Jersey Veterans for John McCain, added: "John McCain knows that as Americans, we are blessed with freedom and liberty due to the courage of our veterans. John McCain's strong support extends to those who are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While his opponent has played politics with troop funding, John McCain continues to fight for our servicemen and women."
McCain's campaign announced the leadership of New Jersey Veterans for John McCain today at a press event in Holmdel. The event was held at the New Jersey Vietnam Era Educational Center, a museum dedicated to telling the full story of the Vietnam War as seen from the front lines as well as the home front.
