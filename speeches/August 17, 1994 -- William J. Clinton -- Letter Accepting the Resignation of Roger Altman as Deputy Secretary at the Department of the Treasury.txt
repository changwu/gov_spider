    Dear Roger:
I have received your letter of today's date resigning as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. I believe you have taken the right step under the circumstances, and I regretfully accept your resignation, effective upon the confirmation of your successor.
I agree with Secretary Bentsen that you have made many valuable contributions to this administration as Deputy Secretary. You played a vital role in the passage of NAFTA and the deficit reduction plan, both critical steps for the American economy. I hope that in due course you will be able to return to public service. Meanwhile, I look forward to the benefit of your continuing advice and assistance.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON


Dear Mr. President:
I am resigning today as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Under the circumstances, this is the proper step to take. With your permission, the resignation would become effective upon the confirmation of my successor.
As I explained to the Senate, I regret any mistakes or errors of judgment I may have made. For them, I apologize. And, hopefully, my stepping down will help to diminish the controversy.
I am proud to have served in your Administration. It has laid a foundation for improving the security and standards of living of the American people. From the Economic Plan to NAFTA to health care, you have consistently made courageous decisions. And, I believe that history will regard them as such.
It has been a special privilege to serve you, Secretary Bentsen, and the American people over the past year and a half. Thank you very much for the opportunity you gave me. I believe fervently in the Administration's agenda and hope to advance it in other capacities.
Sincerely,
ROGER ALTMAN
