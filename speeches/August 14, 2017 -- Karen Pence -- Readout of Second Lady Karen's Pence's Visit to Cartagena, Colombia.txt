    Upon arrival in Cartgena Sunday afternoon, Second Lady Karen Pence enjoyed a beautiful walking tour through the Old City of Cartagena. After the tour, Mrs. Pence proceeded to the Hyatt Regency Cartagena Hotel to participate in an art therapy roundtable discussion with practitioners from Bogot√° and Cali. Art therapy is a new profession within the area of mental health in Colombia. Just over ten years ago, the first Colombian art therapists began practicing in country. Currently, art therapy courses are not offered at any of the universities in Colombia. Mrs. Pence's visit helped to raise awareness of the profession and the benefits of receiving the unique treatment. Following the roundtable discussion, the Second Lady joined the Vice President for dinner with the President and First Lady of Colombia.
On Monday morning, the Second Lady joined the Vice President to visit Calvary Church Cartagena where the Pastor does missionary work with Venezuelans who moved to Colombia to escape the Maduro regime. There, the Second Lady led a prayer before she and the Vice President visited with the Venezuelans who were present at the church. After the visit, they headed to the airport for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina.
