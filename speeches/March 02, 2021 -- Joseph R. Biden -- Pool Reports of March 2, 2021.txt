In-Town Pool Report #5: Remarks End/Questions
Asked when things will get back to normal, Biden says “I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure.”
“But my hope is by this time next year we’re going to be back to normal, and before that my hope,” he added.
Your pooler asked if he thinks there’s a crisis at the border. “No, we will be able to handle it—god willing,” POTUS said as he walked out of the room.
Biden: “We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken even before employees are vaccinated.”
Biden: “We want every educator, school staff member, childcare-workers receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.”
“We are making progress from the mess we inherited,” POTUS says before adding that “things may get worse again.” His administration, he says, “will never take this health crisis lightly.”
“Now is not the time to let our guard down,” he says of need to keep wearing masks.

Also, because I was in a hurry to get that last pool report out, I didn't clarify that the quotes about re-opening and about the border were in response to shouted questions. The quotes below that were from his speech.
Have a good one.
