    Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama's healthcare law is terrible news for Texans. This disturbing overreach of government means Texans will be faced with higher costs, little control over healthcare decisions, higher taxes and a weakened job market.It also means Texans will experience more government in their personal lives. This cannot be tolerated. Governor Romney has said that on his first day in office he will begin the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare. Now, more than ever, we are aware of just how much our nation needs a leader like Mitt Romney who will give states the flexibility to pursue innovative solutions for their own residents and who understands that it's the people of this country, not the government, that make America so great."
