    Today, ahead of the sixth Democratic debate in Los Angeles, Andrew Yang and Donald Glover launched a merchandise collaboration at a one-time-only pop-up store. Glover has taken on a creative consultant role on the campaign.
At the pop-up store in downtown Los Angeles, supporters were able to purchase limited and signed editions of Yang2020 merchandise designed by Glover's team, including sweatshirts, hats, and posters.
The specialized merchandise embodies the core policies and values of Andrew Yang's Humanity First platform and future collaborations are expected.
