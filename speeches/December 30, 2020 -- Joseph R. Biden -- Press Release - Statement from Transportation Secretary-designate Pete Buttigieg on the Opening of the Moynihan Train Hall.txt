    The Moynihan Train Hall is one of the most significant passenger rail facilities to open in years, and has been decades in the making. The newly renovated Hall — in a space which was mostly abandoned for the better part of two decades — will be a shining jewel in the Northeast Corridor, and is a terrific example of the results that are possible when federal government comes together with state and local leadership. Because of the vision of President-elect Biden and the Obama administration in collaboration with local partners, this once-vacant space — through a Recovery Act grant that jumpstarted this project — will expand Penn Station, the nation's busiest rail terminal, and serve hundreds of thousands of people every day with a world-class facility offering passenger rail.
Thank you to Governor Cuomo, Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, the state of New York, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Amtrak, the Federal Railroad Administration, and all project partners for today's milestone. The Biden-Harris administration will always work to be a partner with local communities to transform and build back better our railways, our roads and bridges, transit systems, ports and airports through clean energy and American jobs.
