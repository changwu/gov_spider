Pool report #1/lid
A travel/photo lid was declared at 11:31 am., ahead of the noon call time for the pool.
Your humble pooler was still navigating the many street closures and wide security perimeter and cannot say whether a Marine is stationed outside the West Wing.
Enjoy your weekend and stay safe.
