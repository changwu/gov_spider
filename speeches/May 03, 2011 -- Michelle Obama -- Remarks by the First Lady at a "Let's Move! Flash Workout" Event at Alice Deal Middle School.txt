    MRS. OBAMA: Wow! (Applause and cheers.) Well, I wanted to come and surprise you all. You surprised?
CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: Well, I'm excited. I mean, let me tell you, from the time that we launched "Let's Move," this is one of the things that I was thinking about. I know all of you love Beyoncé, right?
CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: Me, too! Beyoncé is one of my favorite performers on the planet. And when she agreed to remake her video and do this "Let's Move" flash workout, I was so excited, because this is what we've been talking about -- that exercise and moving can be fun. It's about dancing, it's about moving. And if you're doing this, if you all practiced and learned this video, you were working out. You could teach it to your little brothers and sisters, to your parents. All of this is the kind of movement -- and this is way more fun than sitting in front of the TV. Am I right?
CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: So this is an exciting day. Over 600 schools all over the country -- and I heard they even did this in Japan -- at this same time are going to be doing what you're doing, and I wanted to be here and see it.
Now, I haven't had time to learn the moves. I've watched the video. I haven't been like you guys, so I'm going to be off to the side just trying not to embarrass myself, but I am so excited to see you all get going.
So with that, I'm turning it back over to Angie, and I want to see you all moving, all right? Okay! (Applause.)
(The kids dance the "Let's Move Flash Workout.)
MRS. OBAMA: That was great! You all have to cool off now. Cool off! That was wonderful! You guys are awesome. I'm so proud of you all. Just keep it up. Keep moving. Keep eating right. Keep exercising. You got it? You want to do it again?
CHILDREN: Yes!
MRS. OBAMA: One more time! One more time!
