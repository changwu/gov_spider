Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Representative Jim McCrery's announcement last night that he will retire from Congress:
"In 2009, Representative Jim McCrery will leave the United States Congress after 20 years of service to the people of Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District. All Republicans can be proud of his record of accomplishment. Jim stood strong for our common conservative principles. He helped write and pass the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. In 2001 and again in 2003, he played a critical role in the passage of the President's tax cuts which have helped keep our economy strong.
"As the leader of our Romney for President team in the United States House of Representatives, Jim has been a critical supporter and friend, and I look forward to continuing our work together in this campaign to change Washington. Ann and I wish him the best and know that his family looks forward to spending more time together."
