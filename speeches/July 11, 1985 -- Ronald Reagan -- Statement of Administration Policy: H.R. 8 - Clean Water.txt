    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Howard (D) New Jersey)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 8, the Water Quality Renewal Act of 1985. H.R. 8 would reverse four years of fiscal restraint and would help return us to business-as-usual on Federal spending. Should H.R. 8 reach the President in its present form, the President's advisors would strongly recommend disapproval.
H.R. 8 is objectionable because:
— the bill's multi-year spending levels are not sustainable under current fiscal limitations, and will not fit within either the House or Senate Budget Resolutions;
— progress in cleaning up our lakes and streams will continue without the massive new spending programs contained in H.R. 8;
— H.R. 8 represents a return to business-as-usual on Federal spending: almost $1 billion in this bill is earmarked for ten low priority projects funded outside the regular construction grants program. There is no justification for funding these ten projects differently than other similarly worthwhile projects;
— H.R. 8 would reverse years of fiscal restraint. It is:

$18 billion over the Administration's request;
$4.5 billion over the current services baseline for 1986-90 — First year authorizations alone under this bill are $1.9 billion or 75 percent higher than 1985 appropriated amounts;
almost $6 billion over the Senate passed companion bill; and

— if the Federal Government ever expects to get its fiscal house in order, it must begin by paring back massive, increases in existing programs and making a commitment not to begin new, programs costing billions of dollars.
