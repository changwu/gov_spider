    We are pleased that the court has rejected petitioners' attempts to block the Clean Power Plan from moving forward while litigation proceeds. We are confident that the plan will reduce carbon pollution and deliver better air quality, improved public health, and jobs across the country. We look forward to continuing to work with states and other stakeholders taking steps to implement the Clean Power Plan.
