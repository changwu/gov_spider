    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Rep. Mica (D) Florida and 33 others)
The Administration supports Senate passage of H.R. 4151 and the adoption of amendments to:
— restore the full $4.4 billion authorization requested over five years by the Administration to enable the implementation of an adequate security program;
— revise section 103(b)(2) to require the Secretary of State to coordinate rather than establish overseas staffing levels because as drafted this section could diminish the management prerogatives of other agency heads;
— amend section 402 to allow only U.S. persons or U.S. joint venture persons to bid on those portions of diplomatic construction projects considered secure areas, especially in countries where there are high terrorism or penetration threats;
— modify section 605(b) to make clear that Fascell Fellows would be deemed Federal employees for the purposes of all laws governing Federal employment,
— amend the authorizations for appropriations in sections 501 and 502 to clarify that they are not in addition to those now available for the Administration of Foreign Affairs (P.L. 99-93) and under section 36 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act, and are permissive ceilings rather than earmarks; and
— delete section 710, which would increase the authorization of appropriations for the Peace Corps for fiscal year 1987 by $7.2 million as part of a six year plan to increase the Peace Corps strength to 10,000, because the President has not requested these additional funds.
