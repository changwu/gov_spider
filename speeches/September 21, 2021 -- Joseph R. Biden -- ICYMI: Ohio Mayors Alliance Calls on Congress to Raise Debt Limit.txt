    Today, the Ohio Mayors Alliance Board issued a statement urging Congress to raise the debt limit, warning that failure to pay the nation's obligations could result in economic downturn and financial ruin for hardworking families in cities across Ohio – and the country.
Penned by bipartisan mayors from across Ohio, the Mayors Alliance statement called on Congress to abandon partisan politics and uphold its duty to fulfill "this basic tenet of fiscal responsibility."
The statement follows a fact sheet from the White House last week that warned of the consequences failing to raise the debt limit could have on states and cities and the United States Conference of Mayors sounding the alarm to the severe repercussions the default would have on local economies. If Congress fails to act, the U.S. could – for the first time in history – default on its obligations, threatening a recession and drastic cuts to an array of state and local priorities.
Read the full statement below:
"As a bipartisan coalition of mayors, we are urging Congress to set partisan politics aside to address the debt limit in a responsible, bipartisan way. Now is not the time to let politics or other priorities threaten this basic tenet of fiscal responsibility. As mayors from opposing parties, we don't always agree, but we do know that the United States must pay its bills. To do anything less would threaten our economic recovery and create further instability for families, workers, businesses, and local communities likes ours."
