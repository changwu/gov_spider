    LAS VEGAS, NV -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its Washington Small Business Leaders for McCain chairs. Several Seattle area small business owners agreed with John McCain's economic plan today, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president.
"John McCain will provide the bold leadership and understanding needed to help grow our economy," said Don Root, Chairman of Supergraphics a division of GM Nameplate. "John McCain is right on taxes. He appreciates that privately held small business provide 65% of jobs in America and knows that increasing our tax burden is not the kind of change we can afford."
Tony Benegas, President of Benegas Engineering added, "John McCain's proven independent record of helping small business grow is the reason why I support him. I am confident that John McCain's economic policies will help grow small businesses and create jobs across the country."
Today in Denver, Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states.
