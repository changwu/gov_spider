  A Proclamation

Each year this Nation sets aside a day on which to honor fathers for all that they do for the well-being of their children and families.
Fathers are family founders. As traditional breadwinners, protectors of wives and children and models for character development and behavior, they contribute to the Nation's strength.
Now that many wives and mothers are enlarging their family responsibilities by working outside their homes, fathers are also adding to their family roles by assisting with child care and household tasks. Fathers thus help provide the continuity and stability that ensure the quality of family life. Children are the particular beneficiaries of their extra effort, for children need the love and attention of both parents.
It is good for us to take this day to express our gratitude to fathers for their love, support and guidance and for the many other contributions they make to our lives.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the joint resolution of the Congress (36 U.S.C. 142a), do hereby proclaim Sunday, June 20, 1982, as Father's Day. I invite the States and communities and the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and urge the people to offer public and private expressions of the day to the abiding love and gratitude which they bear for their fathers. I direct government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
