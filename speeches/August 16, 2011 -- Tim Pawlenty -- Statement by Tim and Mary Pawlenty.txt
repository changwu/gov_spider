    It was a great honor to run for President.
It has been an even a greater honor to have friends and supporters like you. Mary and I are incredibly grateful to each of you for your friendship, loyalty and hard work. We deeply appreciate it and will always remember and cherish your kindness.
I wish things had turned out differently. We needed to get a boost at the Ames Straw poll for our campaign to remain viable going forward. As you know, that didn't happen and I withdrew from the race.
Today, Mary and I are driving Anna to start her freshman year at college. As we reflect on this family milestone, we're reminded of what matters most.
We will be taking time to prayerfully consider what is next. One thing is for sure, I remain committed to turning this country around, getting a Republican elected to the White House and advancing the values we share in common and hold so dear.
Again, our warmest wishes and deepest thanks to all of you.
Sincerely,
Tim and Mary
