    West Des Moines, Iowa—The Iowa for Warren campaign today announced endorsements from 25 leaders from across Iowa, building on the depth and breadth of support for Elizabeth Warren and her plans for big, structural change. The endorsements come from current and former Iowa Democratic leaders as well as activists with deep ties to their communities.
Among the new endorsers are state Rep. Art Staed, two former state legislators, six current or former local elected officials and six Democratic Party activists.
"Elizabeth Warren has the passion and intellect to unite and lead our nation," Art Staed said. "Even in these times of polarization, we can make big, structural change if we lead with compassion, thoughtfulness and decisive action—and that's exactly what Elizabeth will do."
Staed is the tenth state legislator to endorse Warren, joining state Sens. Joe Bolkcom, Claire Celsi, Eric Giddens, and Zach Wahls, and state Reps. Liz Bennett, Tracy Ehlert, Lindsay James, Mary Mascher, and Mary Wolf.
