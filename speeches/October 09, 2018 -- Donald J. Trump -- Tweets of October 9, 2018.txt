The paid D.C. protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven't gotten their checks - in other words they weren't paid! Screamers in Congress and outside were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills!Retweets: 25502Favorites: 94224

.@FLGovScott has been relentless in securing the funding to fix the algae problem from Lake Okeechobee - we will solve this! Congress must follow through on the Government's plan on the Everglades Reservoir. Bill Nelson has been no help!Retweets: 14657Favorites: 57361
