    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a Protocol signed at Ottawa on June 14, 1983, amending the Convention between the United States and Canada with respect to taxes on income and on capital, signed at Washington on September 26, 1980. I also transmit a related exchange of notes and the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
Senate consideration of the Convention, which was transmitted for advice and consent to ratification by letter dated November 12, 1980, has been delayed pending the correction of certain technical problems in its text. The Protocol resolves these technical problems by clarifying the language of the Convention to assure that its original intent is fulfilled.
In addition, the Protocol makes a necessary change regarding pensions, annuities and alimony and amends the Convention to permit the United States to exercise its full taxing right, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Act, section 897 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Protocol also includes a new rule which affects an athlete resident in one State who is a recipient of a bonus from an employer resident in another State. The new rule protects such a recipient by limiting the rate of tax in the State of the employer.
It is most desirable that this Protocol, together with the Convention, be considered by the Senate as soon as possible and that the Senate give advice and consent to ratification of both instruments.
