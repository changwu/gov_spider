    The President authorized today the immediate transport of emergency food shipments to Armenia. The President ordered this action in response to an urgent request October 30 from Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan concerning critical shortages of wheat grain in Armenia caused by unstable political and economic conditions in the Caucasus region.
To assist Armenia in this current crisis, the United States will begin to airlift on November 1, employing four U.S. Air Force C - 5 aircraft from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. These aircraft will transport 236 metric tons of all purpose flour for delivery to the Armenian capital of Yerevan during the next few days.
In order to address the longer term winter food needs of the Armenian people, the United States has begun the shipment by sea of 66,000 metric tons of wheat grain. The U.S. will also transport 3,000 metric tons of processed commodities from warehouses in Turkey.
Today's action by the President demonstrates anew U.S. commitment to the welfare of the Armenian people and to the independence of Armenia. It is another example of the close bilateral relationship between the United States and the government of Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan.
