Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett on his book 'THE RUSSIA HOAX THE ILLICIT SCHEME TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON AND FRAME DONALD TRUMP' going to #1 on @nytimes and Amazon. It is indeed a HOAX and WITCH HUNT illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. Great book!Retweets: 13932Favorites: 60344

...Dianne is the person leading our Nation on 'Collusion' with Russia (only done by Dems). Will she now investigate herself? https://t.co/OG6l04bBwgRetweets: 18732Favorites: 57212

Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart which isn't easy to do. I like Mike!Retweets: 49313Favorites: 180381

Will be going to Ohio tonight to campaign for Troy Balderson for the big Congressional Special Election on Tuesday. Early voting is on. Troy is strong on Crime the Border & loves our Military Vets & 2nd Amendment. His opponent is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi/high taxes.Retweets: 15637Favorites: 70696

Troy Balderson running for Congress from Ohio is in a big Election fight with a candidate who just got caught lying about his relationship with Nancy Pelosi who is weak on Crime Borders & your 2nd Amendment-and wants to raise your Taxes (by a lot). Vote for Troy on Tuesday!Retweets: 19899Favorites: 76470

Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. China market has dropped 27% in last 4months and they are talking to us. Our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated. America First.......Retweets: 20071Favorites: 86527

....Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry. Plants are opening all over the U.S. Steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury. Other countries use Tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream!Retweets: 13722Favorites: 61221

....Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. Only fools would disagree. We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs. We win either way......Retweets: 17819Favorites: 81002

....China which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and P.R. trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy. Likewise other countries. We are Winning but must be strong!Retweets: 16553Favorites: 69589
