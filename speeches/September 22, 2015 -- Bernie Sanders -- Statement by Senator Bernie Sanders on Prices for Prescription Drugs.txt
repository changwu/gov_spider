    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Tuesday on his proposal to rein in skyrocketing prices for prescription drugs:
"The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people. We now pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and 1 in 5 Americans – including patients suffering with cancer – cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.
"The time is long overdue for Congress to listen to the needs of the American people and not the enormously-profitable pharmaceutical industry. The top three drug companies racked up $45 billion in profits last year after the industry doled out $250 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.
"In 1999, I was the first member of Congress to take Americans across the border to purchase lower-cost drugs in Canada. Americans should not have to leave their country to get affordable medicine. Congress must act now to allow the re-importation of low-cost prescription drugs and Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry to save seniors and taxpayers billions of dollars."
