    Democrats continue to live in a fantasy world when it comes to the rising threat of radical Islamic terrorism and unfolding chaos in the Middle East.
Just weeks after the terrorist attack shook San Bernardino, Hillary Clinton claimed we're "where we need to be" in the fight against ISIS. Now, in a mind-boggling blog post published by the U.S. State Department, the Obama Administration touts "bringing peace" to Syria and "winning the fight against violent extremists" as 2015 foreign policy successes.
4 million refugees. A breeding ground for radical Islamic terrorists. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians slaughtered. What alternate universe are they living in? Jeb shared his reaction on Fox News:

It's not surprising for the Obama-Clinton-Kerry team who has gotten it wrong from Day One. This is the team responsible for the "reset" with Russia, that called Syrian dictator Bashar Assad a "reformer" and championed a strategy of "leading from behind."
They've outdone themselves in 2015, appeasing the brutal Castro regime, holding a "summit" to talk about radical Islamic terrorism instead of leading the fight against it and negotiating a disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism. By the way, it looks like they counted each of those as 2015 foreign policy wins, too.
This is fantasyland foreign policy.
In 2016, it's critical that we elect a president who understands the national security threats we face and has a strategy to address them as Commander-in-Chief. Join Jeb today.
