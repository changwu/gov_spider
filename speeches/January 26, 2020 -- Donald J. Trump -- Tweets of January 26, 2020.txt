The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before. In just two hours the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have seen their phony case absolutely shredded.

Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!Retweets: 34100Favorites: 147581

Paul Krugman is a lightweight thinker who doesn't have a clue. Caused huge economic damage to his follower's pocketbooks. He, and others, should be fired by @nytimes! https://t.co/1K5AtQbmrpRetweets: 11887Favorites: 47171

"This is what Democrats have done. They want to create the idea that there is all this smoke so people think there's fire. They did this with Russia Collusion, & there was no fire.

Great Editorial in today's Wall Street Journal, "And Congress Shall Be King." Bottom line: "The President becomes a vassal of King Congress. This is another reason for the Senate to repudiate this House Impeachment as its own abuse of power." A partisan Hoax!Retweets: 16711Favorites: 66180

Sleepyeyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Corrupt Press, just had a "totally" softball interview with conman Adam Schiff, never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress, where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President!

Kobe Bryant, despite being one of the truly great basketball players of all time, was just getting started in life. He loved his family so much, and had such strong passion for the future. The loss of his beautiful daughter, Gianna, makes this moment even more devastating....Retweets: 94246Favorites: 735478
