    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/1/94)(House)(Rep. Montgomery (D) MS and 8 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4768. The Administration, however, will work with the Senate to offset the direct spending associated with the bill.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4768 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
