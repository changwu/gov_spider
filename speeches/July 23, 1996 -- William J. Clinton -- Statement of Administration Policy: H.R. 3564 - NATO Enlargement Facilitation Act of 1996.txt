(House)(Gilman (R) NY and 34 cosponsors)
The. Administration welcomes Congressional support for the enlargement of the NATO Alliance as reflected in H.R. 3564. A consensus for enlargement exists among NATO's member states, and a process leading to the accession of new members from among the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe is well underway. The Administration also welcomes efforts, as demonstrated by the findings and policy sections of the bill, to build further support in the Congress for NATO enlargement, as well as suDDort for the authority to carry out the Regional Airspace Initiative.
The Administration, however, does have some concerns about the bill's appropriation authorization provisions, which could complicate efforts to support political and market economic reforms elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The Administration does not support the bill's earmarks which eliminate flexibility required to adjust funding to changing circumstances as the enlargement process proceeds.
In addition, the Administration stresses that, while the legislation specifically mentions some of the countries that have made considerable progress toward meeting the criteria for NATO membership, no decisions have yet been taken by NATO or the United States as to the country or countries that will be invited to begin accession negotiations with NATO. The Administration's approach to European security and NATO enlargement is inclusive. The Administration wants to avoid any approach to enlargement that would complicate efforts to enhance stability and security in Europe.
