Folks are headed to the polls in South Carolina tomorrow—and before they do, we need them to know what our candidate stands for.
Here's the bottom line: Hillary Clinton knows how to walk the walk, talk the talk, and will simply get it done—whether that means giving the middle class a raise, fighting for racial justice, or standing up to the gun lobby to keep our communities safe.
She's been doing it her entire career.

And she's not even close to finished.



So here's your mission for the day: Share this video with everyone you know in South Carolina. And if you don't know anyone in South Carolina, share it anyway—you might reach someone who does.?
Hillary is out there fighting for us every day—so let's get out there and fight for her! Share the full video today and let's bring home a big win in South Carolina tomorrow.
