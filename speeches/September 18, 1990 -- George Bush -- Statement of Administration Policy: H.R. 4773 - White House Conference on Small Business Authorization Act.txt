    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(LaFalce (D) New York and 16 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4773.
H.R. 4773 would require the President to call a National White House Conference on Small Business in 1994, to be preceded by conferences in each State. The Small Business Administration is already engaged-in extensive efforts to facilitate communications among owners of small businesses. In the absence of compelling national small business issues, H.R. 4773 would impose unnecessary costs on the Federal Government and on small businesses.
