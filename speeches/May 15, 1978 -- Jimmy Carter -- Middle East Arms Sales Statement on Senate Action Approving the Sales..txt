    I am deeply gratified by the Senate's decision today which will permit the proposed arms sales to Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. That action reaffirms our historic and unshakable commitment to the security of Israelâ€”a commitment which will continue to have the unwavering support of this administration and the American people.
At the same time, the Senate vote strengthens our ties with moderate Arab nations who share our goal of peace and stability in the region. We also honor bipartisan pledges made by the previous administration as well as my own to help our friends in the Middle East meet their legitimate needs for self-defense.
The approval of these sales will not violate the arms limitation policy of this administration, which I announced last May. That pledge to limit arms sales will be met. If and when other nations are willing to join with us in mutual restraint on the sale of conventional weapons, even greater reductions will be possible.
In the meantime, the Senate's action makes it clear that the United States stands ready to provide needed assistance when unrestrained arms sales by other nations pose a threat to the security of our friends and allies.
With this issue resolved, the sharp debate over the proposed sales can now be put behind us. That debate has been among friends who share the same goals. All of us can now concentrate our full attention on finding a sound and just basis for permanent peace.
The United States will continue to play a responsible and active role in the search for peace in the Middle East. We will intensify our effort to help the parties narrow their differences. Our own national interest and moral values permit us to do no less.
