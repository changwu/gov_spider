    First Lady Melania Trump joined her husband in welcoming leaders and donors of the White House Historical Association to the White House in celebration of a year of great work.
The White House Historical Association is instrumental in helping to preserve and to protect the timeless history and beauty of the White House. The President and First Lady thanked members of the board, leadership from the Historical Association, and generous donors for their support.
Along with the restoration of the Bellang√© Suite and the reupholstered walls in the Red Room, the First Lady works closely with the White House Historical Association on projects that preserve and protect the People's House. Over the last year, Mrs. Trump oversaw the restoration of damaged wall upholstery and drapes in the Green Room, the reframing and conservation of artwork throughout the White House, as well as fully restoring the President's Elevator. Mrs. Trump continues to manage the installation of new upholstery in the Diplomatic Room and, just as recently as this week, the preparations for the renovation of the on-site curatorial storage room are beginning, which will further protect the White House collection. The White House Historical Association also plays an integral part in the annual Easter Egg Roll at the White House.
"It is a great privilege to be entrusted with preserving this historic landmark," First Lady Melania Trump states. "My family is honored to call the White House our home. The public should be able to enjoy the timeless rooms and historic halls for many years to come. I am grateful to the generous donations and support of the White House Historical Association and I look forward to undertaking more projects."
