    U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will kick off his presidential campaign at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Waterfront Park along Lake Champlain in the city where he served as mayor before being elected to Congress.
There will be free Ben & Jerry's ice cream and music by Mango Jam, the Vermont Zydeco/Cajun band.
"My hometown of Burlington and the people of Vermont have a special place in my heart. There is nowhere else in the world where I would hold an event this important," Sanders said.
"In Vermont, I have learned that focusing on important issues and not engaging in negative campaigns is what people want. I have learned that grassroots campaigning – holding town meetings, knocking on doors, face-to-face discussions – is more important than money in winning elections. That is what I have done in Vermont and that is the lesson I will take with me around the country on this national campaign.
"The formal kickoff will set the stage for the campaign to come. I will lay out an 'Agenda for America' which addresses the major crises we face and a vision of a government which works for all of our people and not just the billionaire class," Sanders said.
After the Burlington campaign kickoff, Sanders will travel to New Hampshire on Wednesday and then head to Iowa on Thursday.
