    O'Malley Will Serve as Chair of Maryland Campaign
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and named him Chair of Hillary's Maryland campaign.
"At a critical time in our history, Hillary Clinton is the kind of experienced leader this country needs," O'Malley said. "No one is better equipped to repair America's alliances abroad and address the urgent needs of our communities at home."
O'Malley was elected Governor in 2006, after two successful terms as mayor of Baltimore. He gained national prominence for his role in improving education and test scores and lowering the city's violent crime rate by 40 percent, while attracting $10 billion in new investment to revitalize Baltimore's economy. His CitiStat initiative to target the City's spending and track results received Harvard's prestigious Innovations in American Government Award in 2004 and has helped save residents more than $350 million. From 2003 to 2006, O'Malley chaired the U.S. Conference of Mayors Task Force on Homeland Security.
Long recognized as a rising star, O'Malley has been named "The Best Young Mayor in the Country" by Esquire Magazine and one of America's "Top 5 Big City Mayors" by Time Magazine. In 2005, Business Week listed O'Malley as one of "Five Fresh Faces" to lead the Democratic Party.
Prior to his election as Mayor, O'Malley served two terms as a Baltimore City Councilman, chairing the Legislative Investigations Committee and the Taxation & Finance Committee.
"Martin is a terrific leader whose innovative initiatives have been emulated around the country," Clinton said. "I'm honored that he will lead our efforts in Maryland."
