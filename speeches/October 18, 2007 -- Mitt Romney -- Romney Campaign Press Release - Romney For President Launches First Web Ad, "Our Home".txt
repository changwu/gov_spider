Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its first web ad, "Our Home." The ad features Ann Romney talking about raising five sons and her devotion to her family. Governor Romney believes that the most important work being done in America today is the work going on within the four walls of the American home. As President, Governor Romney will act to strengthen the American family and clean up the culture that surrounds our children.
The ad will be featured on AnnTV on the AnnRomney.com web site. "Our Home" will also begin airing as part of the campaign's rotation in Iowa on Friday. Script and viewing link are below.
"Our Home" will also be used as an innovative advertisement on user-generated online video sites.

Script For "Our Home" (TV:30):
ANN ROMNEY: "We have five boys – five boys and ten grandkids. Big family.
"Mitt says his greatest success is being able to say 'I have been a good father, and a good husband.'
"Sometimes I'd be home with those five boys, and it was rough.
"He'd call home and remind me that what I was doing was much more important than what he was doing.
"Mitt says there's no work more important than what goes on within the four walls of the American home. And that's the way it was in our home.
"I'm Ann Romney."
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message."
