    President George W. Bush today announced his intention to nominate James W. Ziglar to be Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization.
"Jim Ziglar is an experienced manager who will work diligently to reform the INS. He has strong relationships with Republicans and Democrats in the Congress and has worked in both the public and private sectors. His history of overseeing large organizations and tackling management challenges makes Jim an excellent choice as Commissioner of the INS," said the President.

Prior to his election, he served as Managing Director of Paine Webber Incorporated in the firm's Municipal Securities Group.

During that time, Mr. Ziglar had responsibility for the National Infrastructure Finance Group and the West Coast General Markets Group.
In addition to his 23 years in the public sector finance industry, he has worked in various capacities of the federal government. He served as Assistant Secretary of Interior for Water and Science from 1987 to 1988, where he directed the operations of the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Mines. He served a member of the Senior Advisory Group on Water Governance of the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations and was the joint recipient of the Water Statesman of the Year Award from the National Water Resources Association in 1988.
Mr. Ziglar is a Mississippi native and received both his undergraduate and J.D. from George Washington University.
