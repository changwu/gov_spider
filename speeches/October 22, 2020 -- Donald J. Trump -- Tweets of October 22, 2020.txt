The Radical Biden-Harris Agenda is projected to slash the typical American's income by $6,500 per year. They will raise TAXES by $4 TRILLION DOLLARS – triggering a mass exodus of jobs out of America and into foreign countries.  https://t.co/pUVreuusxzRetweets: 13725Favorites: 50622

The first thing Washington Democrats will do if Biden is elected is pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will eliminate your 2nd Amendment. https://t.co/hcEZcys5cnRetweets: 14348Favorites: 57990

If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm NOT a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before!  https://t.co/gsFSghkmdMRetweets: 40384Favorites: 161313

For years you had a President who apologized for America‚Äînow you have a President who is standing up for America, and standing up for YOU. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and co-workers, and GET OUT AND VOTE. Together, we are going to #MAGA!  https://t.co/1EscDM2EuNRetweets: 28031Favorites: 119792

I did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years. A VOTE for Republicans is a VOTE for SAFE communities, great JOBS, and a limitless FUTURE for ALL AMERICANS!  https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc  https://t.co/A7GSc2ET9cRetweets: 27882Favorites: 131041

I am not just running against Biden, I am running against the Corrupt Media, the Big Tech Giants, and the Washington Swamp. It is time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites by delivering Joe Biden a THUNDERING defeat on November 3rd! #MAGA  https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc  https://t.co/eRRgjnhyIiRetweets: 59717Favorites: 216048

I will soon be giving a first in television history full, unedited preview of the vicious attempted takeout interview of me by Lesley Stahl of @60Minutes. Watch her constant interruptions & anger. Compare my full, flowing and magnificently brilliant answers to their Q's.  https://t.co/L3szccGamPRetweets: 33245Favorites: 118673

.@FoxNews Polls are totally FAKE, just like they were in 2016. I am leading in all of the states mentioned, which you will soon see. I thought Fox was getting rid of its pollster. Sadly, it never happened!Retweets: 26910Favorites: 144624

Obama is campaigning for us. Every time he speaks, people come over to our side. He didn't even want to endorse Sleepy Joe. Did so long after primaries were over!Retweets: 36232Favorites: 206025

Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse.Retweets: 27398Favorites: 134556

Biden wants to Pack the Court with Radical Left crazies. He doesn't even want to make a list to explain who they are. Can't let this happen!Retweets: 29435Favorites: 155759
