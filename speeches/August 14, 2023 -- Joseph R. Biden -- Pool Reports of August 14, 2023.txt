In town pool report #1 Arrival
POTUS walked off Marine One at 11:09 a.m., crossed the lawn and entered the Oval Office.
He kept a fair distance from the pool and did not respond to shouted questions regarding Sen. Tuberville, Hunter Biden and the special counsel. He was far enough away that it was unclear whether he could hear the questions over the background noise.
