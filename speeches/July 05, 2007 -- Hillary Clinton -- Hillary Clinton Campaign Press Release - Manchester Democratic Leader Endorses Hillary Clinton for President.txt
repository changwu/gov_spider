    MANCHESTER, NH -- The New Hampshire for Hillary campaign today announced the endorsement of Chris Pappas, Chair of the Manchester City Democrats and Hillsborough County Treasurer.
"Hillary Clinton speaks strongly and clearly and has a tremendous grasp on the issues. The first thing the next president has to do is to get us out of Iraq swiftly and reengage the world community," said Pappas. "I know no one will take up that task more aggressively and more successfully than Sen. Clinton. Her vast experience will enable her to be successful from the moment she steps into the White House."
Pappas, who is just 27 years old and a lifelong Manchester resident, also served two terms as a New Hampshire state representative, and is currently the Chair of the Hillsborough County Democratic Committee. The Pappas family owns and operates the Puritan Restaurant and Backroom, a well-known Manchester landmark.
"I am honored to have the support of such a committed Democratic leader," said Senator Clinton. "I look forward to working with Chris in the coming months as I continue to discuss my goals for our country with Granite Staters."
