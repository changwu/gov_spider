    Mitt Romney today announced endorsements of elected officials and leaders in Maine.
"It's an honor to receive the support of so many leaders in Maine," said Mitt Romney. "Our country is in need of a turnaround and I am excited to work with these great leaders to put America back on the path to prosperity."
Announcing his support, Attorney General William Schneider said, "Governor Romney understands what this country is facing. He has spent his life turning failing businesses, including the 2002 Winter Olympics, into successful enterprises, and as governor, he balanced the budget without raising taxes. That is the kind of leadership we need to restore America's greatness."
