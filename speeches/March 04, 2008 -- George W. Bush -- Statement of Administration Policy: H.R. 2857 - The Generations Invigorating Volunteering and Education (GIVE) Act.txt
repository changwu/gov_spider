    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D) New York and 32 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2857, which would reauthorize the national service programs administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Administration appreciates that the bill includes provisions consistent with the President's principles for reauthorization to make these programs more effective and efficient, responsive to State and local needs, and performance-oriented. In particular, H.R. 2857 would amend the national service laws to introduce competition to the RSVP program and incorporate requested technical amendments to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens on States.
The Administration is committed to making the Federal investment for national service programs more accountable and cost-effective and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address the Administration's remaining concerns with the Committee-reported bill as the legislation moves forward.
The Administration opposes the authority in H.R. 2857 for several new programs and activities that are not included in the President's FY 2009 Budget. In addition, the Administration strongly supports the flexibility that is provided in the bill to support competitive, merit-based grants to national associations and organizations that strengthen and mobilize more citizen volunteers. The Administration also supports introducing competition in the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion programs and is concerned by the bill's focus of Senior Corps demonstration authority on existing grantees.
