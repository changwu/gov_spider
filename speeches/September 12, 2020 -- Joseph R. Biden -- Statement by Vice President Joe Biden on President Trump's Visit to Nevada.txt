    President Trump can't hide from the truth. Months after admitting to misleading the American public about the pandemic, he still has no plan to contain COVID-19, a virus that has killed more than 1,400 Nevadans, afflicted more than 72,000 residents and devastated the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers across the Silver State.
Nevadans don't need more bluster from the President, and don't need his reckless rallies that ignore the realities of COVID-19 and endanger public health. Nevada families need solutions â€” from containing the pandemic to building the economy back better to making quality health care more accessible to millions of Americans. That's the change I'll deliver as your next president.
