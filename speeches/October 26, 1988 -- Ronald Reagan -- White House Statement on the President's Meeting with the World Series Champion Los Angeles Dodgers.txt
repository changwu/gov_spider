    The Los Angeles Dodgers had a group picture taken with the President and First Lady in the Oval Office prior to their appearance in the Rose Garden. There was considerable banter back and forth with the players.
Orel Hershiser asked the President to autograph his baseball. He also gave Mrs. Reagan a world championship T-shirt. Tommy Lasorda told the President, "I knew you were pulling for us to take the whole thing." Mrs. Reagan described Tommy Lasorda coming out of the dugout after Kirk Gibson hit his game-winning home run. The President quipped, "You should have seen Nancy practicing. Balls were coming off the chandeliers." Pitcher Don Sutton gave President Reagan a 300th game ball won on June 18, 1986.
Steve Sax was prodded by his teammates to perform what must be a well-practiced imitation of the President. After initially declining, Steve drew himself up in his best Ronald Reagan imitation with the words, "Well, it's a pleasure . . ."
