    Following reports that two federal inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation into the sharing of sensitive government information via Hillary Clinton's private email account, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement.
"Attorney General Lynch needs to do the right thing and immediately launch an investigation into whether Secretary Clinton broke the law and endangered our national security by using a private email server to conduct official State Department business. Given Clinton's reputation for thinking she's above the rules—and her previous denial that she emailed classified material—a complete and thorough criminal investigation is the only way to get to the bottom of this serious matter. Even if the investigation proceeds, however, we may never know the truth about what Clinton used her email for because she has already admitted deleting a trove of emails that could have been potential evidence. The United States cannot afford to have a commander-in-chief who believes it is worth risking the safety and security of the American people in order to avoid personal accountability and scrutiny. To preserve the integrity of our political system, the Justice Department must accept the recommendation of two inspectors general appointed by President Obama and launch this long-overdue investigation."
