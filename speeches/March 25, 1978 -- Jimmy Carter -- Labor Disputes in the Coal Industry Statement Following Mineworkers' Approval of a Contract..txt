    I am pleased that the members of the United Mine Workers have voted to approve the latest coal contract. Miners will now be returning to work early next week, and full coal production will resume shortly.
From the outset, we have known that the only satisfactory conclusion to this strike would be a collectively bargained agreement, acceptable to both sides. Over the past 6 weeks, our efforts have been directed toward that end.
With Friday's vote, we have achieved that goal. This Nation has endured a long strike without widespread unemployment or drastic reductions in electric power. Despite many predictions to the contrary, there has been no serious violence.
The contract which was approved on Friday upholds the important principle of industrywide bargaining between the coal operators and the UMW.
The Governors of the States most affected by the strike have displayed great leadership and cooperation in dealing with its consequences.
I particularly wish to thank the people of the affected regions. Through their conservation efforts, coal demand was reduced and far worse coal shortages averted.
The work of three Federal departments also greatly aided the resolution of this problem. The Department of Labor and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service were evenhanded as they facilitated collective bargaining, and the Department of Energy showed great ingenuity and organization as it coordinated the movement of coal to the areas which needed it most.
However, the Government's interest in the coal industry does not end with this contract agreement. I will soon appoint a Presidential Commission on the Coal Industry, a panel which will address the industry's long-term problems.
Friday's agreement, coupled with the work of this Commission, will enable the coal industry to take its rightful place as one of the foundations of our long-term energy strategy.
