    Jon Huntsman for President today released a new web video, "Mitting Image," that shows Mitt Romney offering hard-hitting, straightforward criticism of flip-floppers. This web video comes as Mitt Romney releases his newest campaign commercial touting his "steadiness and constancy."
"While Mitt Romney is running an ad claiming he's a man of 'steadiness and constancy,' his record shows otherwise," said campaign spokesman Tim Miller. "As Romney himself once said, 'in politics it is pretty much standard operating procedure when you are running for office you look at your opponent's record and you say they're a flip-flopper. But in this case, this guy really is.'"
