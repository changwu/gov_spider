    To millions of Americans, Wernher von Braun's name was inextricably linked to our exploration of space and to the creative application of technology. He was not only a skillful engineer but also a man of bold vision; his inspirational leadership helped mobilize and maintain the effort we needed to reach the Moon and beyond.
Not just the people of our Nation but all the people of the world have profited from his work. We will continue to profit from his example.
