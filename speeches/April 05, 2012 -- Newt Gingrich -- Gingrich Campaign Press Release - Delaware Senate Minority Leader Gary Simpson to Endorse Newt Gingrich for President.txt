Simpson has served as Senator of the 18th Legislative District of Delaware since 1999 and he currently serves as Senate Minority Leader. After speaking with Gingrich, Simpson released the following statement:
"The 2012 election represents one of the most important events in the history of this country. I believe Newt Gingrich is the only candidate who can defeat Barack Obama in the fall, and provide solutions to some of the countrys biggest problems, which are also some of the same problems that Delaware voters are facing on a daily basis. It is imperative for Republicans in Delaware and beyond to rally behind a conservative candidate who is capable of handling the most serious of issues. Newt Gingrich has proven he is the strongest candidate among the conservative Republicans running for president. I look forward to helping Newt achieve a victory for all Americans who want to put our country back on the right track."
Newt Gingrich expressed his gratitude for Senator Simpsons support. "I am honored to have the support of such a strong leader in Delaware. Callista and I are grateful for his endorsement and confidence in my candidacy," the Speaker remarked. "We look forward to meeting and working with other residents of Delaware on the issues that matter most to them."
Gingrich is campaigning in Delaware today ahead of the April 24th primary. The rally this evening will be held at 7pm at the Millsboro Fire Hall at 109 East State Street.
