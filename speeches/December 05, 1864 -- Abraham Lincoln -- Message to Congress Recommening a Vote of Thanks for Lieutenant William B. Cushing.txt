    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that Lieutenant William B. Cushing, United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from Congress for his important, gallant, and perilous achievement in destroying the rebel ironclad steamer Albemarle on the night of the 27th of October, 1864, at Plymouth, N. C.
The destruction of so formidable a vessel, which had resisted the continued attacks of a number of our vessels on former occasions, is an important event touching our future naval and milltary operations, and would reflect honor on any office, and redounds to the credit of this young officer and the few brave comrades who assisted in this successful and daring undertaking.
This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the following words, namely:
That any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
