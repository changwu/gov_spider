    The President has said before that he would like to be able to sign a trade bill that will open markets and improve America's international competitiveness. The 17 subconferences have made notable progress in moving toward such a bill, but further improvements must be made. The administration is prepared to continue working with the congressional leadership and the full conference on an acceptable bill. As the full conference moves to complete its work, the President has asked Secretary Baker, Senator Baker, and Ambassador Yeutter to make themselves available to resolve the remaining problems. But let there be no misunderstanding: The President will not hesitate to veto a trade bill that will hurt America's economic prosperity.
