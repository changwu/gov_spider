And at the Newt 2012 Iowa headquarters, volunteers are poring in from all around the country to make calls for Newt and share why he has the knowledge and experience to defeat President Obama and rebuild the America we love.
As the former House speaker drew attention for getting choked up on the campaign trail Friday, scores of volunteers from across the nation cycled through his Iowa campaign headquarters in suburban Des Moines.
Some waved Gingrich campaign signs at rush hour traffic. Others cheered the former Georgia congressman on at a campaign stop at a coffee shop in Des Moines. Many manned a phone bank, urging likely caucus-goers to support Gingrich. Among them were Gordon and Meredith Austin, who traveled from Carrollton, Ga., to work for Gingrich here. Gordon Austin said he made more than a 100 calls to voters Friday.
"I have the bruise on my ear to prove it," said the retired surgeon, one of Gingrich's longtime friends.
  ...
  Fueled with hamburgers and chicken sandwiches, Gingrich's volunteers sat in makeshift booths divided by giant "Newt" signs in his Urbandale campaign office, reading from scripts as they called voters Friday. Others jokingly ad-libbed.
"If you will support Newt, I will mow your yard," Bill Curtis, a geologist from Austin, Texas, told one voter. "Then we could go fishing."
