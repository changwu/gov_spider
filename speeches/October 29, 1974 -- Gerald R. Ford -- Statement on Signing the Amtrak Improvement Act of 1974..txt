    I HAVE signed H.R. 15427, the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1974. However, I believe that one provision of this act is undesirable. I refer to the section which requires mandatory customs inspection aboard trains operated in the international intercity rail passenger service.
This provision would adversely affect the interdiction of the flow of narcotics and other contraband at ports of entry. On-board customs inspection is inconsistent with effective enforcement of customs laws and not always practical. There must be flexibility in determining when and where on-board inspection is to be conducted. Moreover, the requirement for on-board inspection on trains could result in requests for similar treatment aboard airlines and ocean vessels.
I request that the Congress take action to revise the provision to provide for customs inspection consistent with the effective enforcement of the customs and related laws.
