    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Mitchell (D) ME)
If S.J. Res. 137 were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto it. Current economic conditions do not warrant suspension of the Federal budget discipline enacted at the close of the 101st Congress.
The preliminary real economic growth rates reported by the Department of Commerce for the fourth quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991, in combination, leave real GNP at a level almost identical to that projected for the first quarter by the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office.
Current economic signals are mixed â€” as is often characteristic of an economic turning point. A majority of private forecasters believe that the upturn will commence in the current quarter. In this context, a relaxation of fiscal discipline would prove counter-productive.
