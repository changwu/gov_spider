    The world stood in awe as South Africa overcame apartheid to take its place as a global leader and inspiration to mankind. Archbishop Desmond Tutu epitomizes the process of triumphant, democratic transformation. A leader in both struggle and reconciliation, Archbishop Tutu reminds us that the search for justice begins in the heart. His appeal to conscience brought out the best in all South Africans, and his leadership leaves a legacy of decency and spiritual renewal. On behalf of the American people, I extend this heartfelt tribute to Archbishop Tutu as a token of our profound respect and lasting admiration.
