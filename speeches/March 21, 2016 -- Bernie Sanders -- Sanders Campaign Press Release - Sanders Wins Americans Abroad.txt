    SPOKANE, Wash. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Global Presidential Primary, according to results announced on Monday by Democrats Abroad.
"This political revolution that is gaining momentum across America is now resonating all over the world," Sanders said. "There is a clear path to victory as we begin the second half of the delegate selection process. We are waging a strong campaign and plan to take it all the way to the Democratic National Convention this summer in Philadelphia."
According to the party, votes were cast by 34,570 U.S. citizens living in 170 countries. Sanders received 69 percent of the vote. That win earned him nine of the 13 delegates at stake.
The Democrats Abroad victory for Sanders comes on top of winning nine states from New England to the Midwest to the Rocky Mountains.
