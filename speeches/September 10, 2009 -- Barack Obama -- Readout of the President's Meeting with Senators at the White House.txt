    The President and the Senators held a positive and constructive meeting for more than an hour in the Roosevelt Room this afternoon. There was unanimous agreement with the President's position that the health care reform bill must not add to the deficit and that provisions must be included to reduce long-term deficits.
The President expressed his appreciation for the Senators' support and encouragement, and he thanked them for the constructive suggestions they offered for making sure that legislation provides more stability to those with insurance, provides access to insurance for those who don't have it, and lowers the cost of health care for families, businesses, and governments. The President urged the Senators to continue to come to him with suggestions and feedback as the process moves forward.
