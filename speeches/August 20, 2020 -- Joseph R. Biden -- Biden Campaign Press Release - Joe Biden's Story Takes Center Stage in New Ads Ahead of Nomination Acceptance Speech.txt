    Today, ahead of Joe Biden's speech accepting the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Biden for President released a new ad that poses the essential question Americans are grappling with amidst the ongoing crises: "What happens now?"
 Watch "What Happens Now" HERE.
The new ad, titled "What Happens Now," shows how Donald Trump doesn't have the answer, but Joe Biden does. It first underscores how Trump's failed leadership has left many out of work, pay, and health care and then showcases Joe Biden's tested record leading the country during times of uncertainty and upheaval â€” and the actionable steps he will take to lead us our of the current crises we face. Additionally the campaign will broaden the reach of a previous ad, "Backbone," to air beyond Ohio and highlight Biden's working class upbringing, while demonstrating his commitment to working families, a stark contrast to Trump's Administration that has prioritized wealthy donors and the well-connected.
This is the first major push during the general election the campaign is airing ads that lay out key biographical elements about Joe Biden, as the convention is an opportunity for more Americans to be introduced to the Biden and Harris families this week and learn about why they are the right leaders for this moment.
The ads will air in top markets across key battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and on national cable channels. They are part of the Biden for President's ongoing paid media program across television, radio, and digital, with $24 million in spend next week.
