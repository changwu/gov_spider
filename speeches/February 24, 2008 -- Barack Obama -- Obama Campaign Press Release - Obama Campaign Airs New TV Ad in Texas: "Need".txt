    In new TV ad, Obama Vows to Cut Taxes for Working Americans and Seniors
Austin, TX - Senator Barack Obama's Texas campaign began airing a thirty-second spot, entitled "Need." Obama describes American workers as the "bedrock" of our economy and offers his plan to reverse the widening gap between the middle class and the wealthy.
For more than two decades-as a community organizer, a civil rights attorney, a state legislator, and a United States Senator-Obama has been fighting to improve the lives of working Americans. As President, Senator Obama will provide middle class Americans tax relief by cutting income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the payroll tax they pay and eliminate income taxes altogether for seniors who make less than $50,000 annually.

I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
This Administration has further divided Wall Street from Main Street. You got CEOs who are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year.
The bedrock, the foundation of our economy is our workers.
And the middle class have been treading water or worse.
My plan says let's return some balance to our tax code. Close these corporate loopholes the lobbyist put in and
let's make sure that tax breaks are given to people who really need it.
