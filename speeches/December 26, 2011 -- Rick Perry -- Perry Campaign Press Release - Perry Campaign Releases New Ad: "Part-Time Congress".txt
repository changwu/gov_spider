    AUSTIN â€” The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "Part-Time Congress," which will air on Iowa broadcast and cable.

"Gov. Perry is the only Washington outsider in this race. He has never served in Washington or been an establishment favorite," said Perry campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan. "The current and former members of Congress in the race have a legacy of federal debt, earmarks and excess. Gov. Perry has the strongest plan to overhaul Washington, D.C. by creating a part-time Congress, cutting their staff, pay, and time spent in Washington in half."
"Part-Time Congress" Script:
Announcer: "If Washington's the problem, why trust a congressman to fix it?"
"Among them, they've spent 63 years in Congress, leaving us with debt, earmarks, and bailouts."
"Congressmen get $174,000 a year and you get the bill."
"We need a solution."
Gov. Perry: "That's the reason I've called for a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, cut their time in Washington in half, cut their staff in half, send them home. Let them get a job like everybody else back home has."
"I'm Rick Perry, and I approve this message."
