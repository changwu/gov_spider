    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(English (D) Oklahoma and 4 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4862, but may seek changes in the Senate to clarify what information would be subject to the "expedited access" provision contained in the bill. This provision, which is intended to provide for expeditious consideration of requests for certain information under the Freedom of Information Act, is overly broad and could pose problems for agencies in implementing its requirements. The Administration may also seek changes to limit the costs that could be incurred by agencies in implementing the requirment in H.R. 4862 to notify a party that information has been requested.
Although the Administration does not object to H.R. 4862, it continues to support comprehensive reform of the Freedom of Information Act, including much needed reforms to the Act's law enforcement exemption provisions.
