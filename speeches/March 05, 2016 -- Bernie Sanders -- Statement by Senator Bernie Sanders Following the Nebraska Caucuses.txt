"I thank the people of Nebraska for their strong support. The win in Nebraska coupled with a double-digit victory in Kansas tonight will put us on a path toward victory. We've got the momentum, the energy and the excitement that will take us all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
"I feel good about our campaign because the voters are sending a clear message. No matter what the pundits say, it is the voters who will decide this election."
