    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California and Madigan (R) Illinois)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2369 because it (1) rejects the President's proposal to include the resources associated with family planning in the Primary Care Block Grant, which would enable States to allocate primary care resources more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens needs, and (2) duplicates existing activities within the National Institutes of Health to develop end evaluate new or improved contraceptive technologies.
