    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Smith (R) Michigan and 2 cosponsors)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 2942, which would extend the provisions of the bankruptcy code (chapter 12) that address the particular needs of family farmers in financial distress. As the President stated when he signed the previous temporary extension of chapter 12 six months ago, the Administration urges the Congress to make these provisions permanent.
