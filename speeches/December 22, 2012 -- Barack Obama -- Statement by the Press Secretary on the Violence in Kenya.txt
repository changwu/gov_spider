    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the renewed violence in Kenya's Tana River region, which left over 39 dead and dozens injured on Friday, including many women and children. This latest incident represents a disturbing escalation of the tragic violence witnessed by these communities in August and September. We send our deepest sympathy to the families that have lost loved ones in the violence.
We urge the Kenyan government, the Kenyan police, and leaders from the Orma and Pokomo communities to bring an end to this deadly cycle of conflict, intensify efforts to establish a durable peace in the Tana delta, and hold to account the perpetrators of these heinous acts. With historic elections approaching in March, peace and stability are essential to Kenya's continued progress. The United States urges the people of Kenya to assert their rights through peaceful means, as provided for in Kenya's constitution, so that all Kenyans may realize a secure, democratic, and prosperous future.
