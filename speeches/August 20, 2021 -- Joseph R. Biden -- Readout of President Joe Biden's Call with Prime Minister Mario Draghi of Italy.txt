    President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy talked today about the latest developments in Afghanistan. They discussed the importance of continued close coordination between their military and civilian personnel in Kabul, who are working together tirelessly to safely evacuate their citizens, Afghans who courageously supported us and NATO in the war effort, and other vulnerable Afghan nationals. They welcomed the opportunity for the G7 to plan a common approach to Afghanistan policy at next week's virtual leaders' meeting.
