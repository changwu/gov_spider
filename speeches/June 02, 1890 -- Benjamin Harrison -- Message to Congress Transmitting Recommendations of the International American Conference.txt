    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
The International American Conference, recently in session at this capital, recommended for adoption by the several American Republics--
1. A uniform system of customs regulations for the classification and valuation of imported merchandise;
2. A uniform nomenclature for the description of articles of merchandise imported and exported; and
3. The establishment at Washington of an international bureau of information.
The conference also at its final session decided to establish in the city of Washington, as a fitting memorial of its meeting, a Latin-American library, to be formed by contributions from the several nations, of historical, geographical, and literary works, maps, manuscripts, and official documents relating to the history and civilization of America, and expressed a desire that the Government of the United States should provide a suitable building for the shelter of such a library, to be solemnly dedicated upon the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America.
The importance of these suggestions is fully set forth in the letter of the Secretary of State and the accompanying documents, herewith transmitted, to which I invite your attention.
