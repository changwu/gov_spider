    I applaud the decisive and unanimous vote by the United Nations Security Council to suspend the review of sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad resumes full cooperation with the international weapons inspectors. Far from hastening the day sanctions are lifted, Iraq's failure to honor its obligations will prolong the sanctions, constrain Iraq from acquiring resources to rebuild its military, and keep the Iraqi economy under tight international control. The Security Council has made crystal clear that the burden remains on Iraq to declare and destroy all its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
