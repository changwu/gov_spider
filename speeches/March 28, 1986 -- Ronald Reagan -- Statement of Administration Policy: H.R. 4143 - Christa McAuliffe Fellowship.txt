    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Hawkins (D) California)
The Administration has no objection to enactment of H.R. 4143, but notes that the Secretary of Education has already designated a "Christa McAuliffe Scholar's Program" within the Department of Education, and the existence of two similarly named programs may result in confusion.
