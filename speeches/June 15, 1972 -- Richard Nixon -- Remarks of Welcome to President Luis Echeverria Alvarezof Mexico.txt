    Mr. President, Senora Echeverria, all of our distinguished guests:
Mr. President, we welcome you very warmly on your first official visit to Washington. We welcome you as the head of state of a great nation, our great and friendly neighbor to the South. And we welcome you also as a world leader of the first rank.
During the course of our discussions we will have the opportunity to talk about bilateral issues between our two countries. I will be extremely interested in getting your views on hemispheric problems, particularly in view of your very eloquent comments in which you enunciated the Echeverria Doctrine in Santiago a short time ago.
And since you are the first head of government or head of state to visit Washington since my visit to Moscow, I shall look forward to the opportunity to talk with you about international problems of mutual interest. We shall discuss these problems with great frankness and great candor. But what is even more important, we will discuss them as friends.
Mr. President, the people of the United States of America have a very warm place in their hearts for the people of Mexico. I personally, and my wife, have a warm place in our hearts for your country and we feel that as we meet you today, we meet not only as official friends but also as personal friends. We believe that Mexican-American friendship is an indispensable cornerstone to our foreign policy and we believe that our talks will contribute to that friendship and to the cause of peace and progress for all people in the world.
