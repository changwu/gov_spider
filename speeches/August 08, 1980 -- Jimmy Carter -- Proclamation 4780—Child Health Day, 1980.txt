  A Proclamation

All the wealth in the world, in its various forms, and all the progress that man has ever achieved would be meaningless were it not for the children who will some day receive it as a legacy. Our children give our lives continuity and meaning, and it is imperative that we do our utmost to give them, in return, the chance to live rich, vigorous and rewarding lives.
The infant mortality rate in the United States has steadily decreased during this century and is now the lowest in our history?but it is not low enough. Statistically, a child born in this country today can expect 73.2 years of healthy and productive living, but many of our children still die in childhood or infancy.
The health of our children and our posterity requires unfailing vigilance and dedication. Accordingly, I have proposed to the Congress this year a Child Health Assurance Plan to help ensure adequate health care for all American children.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 6, 1980, as Child Health Day.
I urge all Americans to join me in the task of planning, promoting and providing for the physical, environmental and mental health needs of our children.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.

JIMMY CARTER
