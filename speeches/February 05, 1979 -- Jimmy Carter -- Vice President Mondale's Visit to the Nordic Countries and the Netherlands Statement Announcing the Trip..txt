    At the invitation of the Governments of the Nordic countries and the Netherlands, Vice President Mondale will make official visits to Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands in mid-April.
I have asked the Vice President to serve as my personal representative during these visits.
Close and cordial relations with all these nations are very important to us, and the Vice President's visit will reinforce them. We share a great deal in common, not only because we have the same democratic ideals and values but because of close ties of kinship and affection. Four of these nations—Iceland, Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands—are NATO Allies, while two—Sweden and Finland-are neutral states whose independence we respect and with whom we cooperate on major international issues.
During the course of these visits the Vice President will review our excellent bilateral relations, current developments in Europe, developments in East-West relations, and other international issues of mutual interest.
