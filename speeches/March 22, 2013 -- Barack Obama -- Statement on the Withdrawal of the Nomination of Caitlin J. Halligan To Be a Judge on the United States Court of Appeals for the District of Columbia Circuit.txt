    Today I accepted Caitlin Halligan's request to withdraw as a nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I am deeply disappointed that even after nearly 2Â½ years, a minority of Senators continued to block a simple up-or-down vote on her nomination. This unjustified filibuster obstructed the majority of Senators from expressing their support. I am confident that with Caitlin's impressive qualifications and reputation, she would have served with distinction.
The DC Circuit is considered the Nation's second highest court, but it now has more vacancies than any other circuit court. This is unacceptable. I remain committed to filling these vacancies to ensure equal and timely access to justice for all Americans.
