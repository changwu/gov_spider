- In February 2003, The U.S. House Judiciary Committee Held A Hearing Entitled "New York City's 'Sanctuary' Policy And The Effect Of Such Policies On Public Safety, Law Enforcement, And Immigration." Rep. John N. Hostettler (R-IN): "On December 19, 2002, a 42-year-old mother of two was abducted and forced by her assailants into a hideout near some railroad tracks in Queens, New York. ... The NYPD arrested five aliens in connection with that assault. ... Some suggested that the only reason that the three illegal aliens were in the United States, despite their extensive arrest histories, was because the NYPD officers who arrested these aliens previously were barred by a so-called 'sanctuary' policy from contacting the INS. That policy, critics claimed, prevented NYPD officers from contacting the INS when they arrested an illegal alien. We will examine New York City's policy on the NYPD's disclosure of immigration information to the INS. New York's Executive Order, or E.O. 124, barred line officers from communicating directly with the INS about criminal aliens. That executive order was issued by Mayor Ed Koch in 1989 and reissued by Mayors Dinkins and Giuliani."
