    National Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon hosted a strategy session today with Partnership for Central America (PCA) leaders, CEOs from companies that have responded to the Vice President's Call to Action for Northern Central America, and a team of senior U.S. government officials. Building off the more than $3.2 billion in investments mobilized during the first year of the Vice President's Call to Action initiative, the participants discussed an updated framework for driving progress under our collaborative partnership. Meeting participants discussed next steps in the Call to Action, including efforts to advance good governance, anti-corruption, and labor priorities under the broader U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration. They also explored ways the U.S. government could further support private sector investments in response to the Call to Action.
