    AUSTIN - Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement on today's jobs report:
"Today's jobs report showing the lowest growth in four months proves that American employers remain burdened by uncertainty and excessive taxes and regulations. American workers and taxpayers need a president committed to private sector job creation and fiscal sanity in Washington, D.C. As president, I will fundamentally change Washington by cutting taxes to a low, flat 20 percent, cutting federal spending and regulations, and ending bailouts to protect taxpayers and jumpstart American job creation."
