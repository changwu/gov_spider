HOUSTON, Texas – In the first 48 hours following the second GOP presidential debate, the Cruz for President campaign has again seen a fundraising surge topping $1M in new monies raised.
The numbers are impressive:

Dollars Raised: $1,015,973.98
Donations: Over 15,000
Average online donation: $49.54
Pageviews: 273,140

"I am thrilled by the outpouring of financial support we've seen in such a short amount of time," said Sen. Ted Cruz. "The American people are rising up and we are seeing an explosion of momentum. They want an outsider, someone who will stand up to career politicians from both parties and fight the Washington Cartel. They want real leadership from a consistent conservative, not a campaign conservative."
Today's fundraising announcement puts a capstone on a week of impressive grassroots momentum for the Cruz campaign. Yesterday, South Carolina State Representative Wendy Nanney became the 500th member among state leadership teams the Cruz campaign is building across the country.
Cruz's strong debate performances, impressive fundraising hauls, and growing grassroots organizational strength stretching from the early primary states to the 3/1 SEC Primary states and beyond, have Cruz well-positioned to capture the Republican nomination.
