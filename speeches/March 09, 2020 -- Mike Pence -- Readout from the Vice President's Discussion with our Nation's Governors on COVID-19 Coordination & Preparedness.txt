    Vice President Mike Pence today participated in a discussion with nearly 50 of our Nation's governors to provide an update on the work of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to continue coordination with governors and state and local officials to respond to and prepare for the coronavirus, and to thank governors and state and local leaders—particularly state and local health officials—for their important and tireless work.
The Vice President along with White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Ambassador Deborah Birx, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Director Bob Redfield, U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command General Terrence O'Shaunessy, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams provided a status update on the expansion of testing capabilities, increased access to respirators for health care personnel, and the importance of the supplemental funding bill. Various governors provided an update on State and local actions to respond to and prepare for the Coronavirus, including coordination across various state agencies and local governments. Participants also discussed how elderly individuals and individuals with underlying health conditions can protect themselves using common sense precautions.
The Federal supplemental bill authorizes $7.76 billion to Federal, State and local agencies to combat the coronavirus including funds for vaccine development and medical supplies, grants for health agencies and organizations, loans for impacted small businesses, and $500 million in waivers for Medicaid telehealth restrictions.
Governor Larry Hogan, Chair of the National Governors Association, joined the Vice President in person, and other governors joined via video teleconference or phone. The Vice President pledged that Federal leaders will continue to coordinate with our Nation's governors and other State and local leaders.
