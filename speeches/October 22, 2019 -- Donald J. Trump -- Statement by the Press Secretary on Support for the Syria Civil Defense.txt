    Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump authorized $4.5 million in direct support to the Syria Civil Defense (SCD) to continue United States support for the organization's important and highly valued work in the country. Over the course of the 8-year conflict in Syria, the SCD has rescued more than 115,000 people, including many ethnic and religious minorities. The United States encourages our allies and partners to join us in our support for the SCD and in our efforts to protect civilians, religious and ethnic minorities, and other innocent victims of the Syrian conflict.
