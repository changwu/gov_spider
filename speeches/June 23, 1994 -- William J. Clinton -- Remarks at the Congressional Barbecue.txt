    Thank you very much. We want to welcome you back again this year. We want to thank you for braving, first, late votes and then a late rain in all this heat. And finally it's kind of cooling down and getting better.
We're delighted to see you, all of you here tonight. You are welcome here. This is, after all, your house, and we're sort of the temporary tenants, and we're having a good time. We're really looking forward to hearing Trisha Yearwood tonight. And I hope you've enjoyed all the wonderful food. And I'd like to ask that we give a round of applause to the people who provided that. [Applause]
Hillary and I have tried to make this event and the one we had last year fun, relaxing, nonpolitical, which is almost impossible in Washington. And only the heat reminds us of the atmosphere in which we must labor during the daylight hours. [Laughter] But we have really enjoyed having you here tonight.
I want to thank the Members who came and brought their family members, their friends, their staff members. It really helps us, I think, to get a feel for the human side of what we hope will be a very enjoyable night for you. And I think there's already been enough talking, and I'm ready for the music.
Would you like to say anything? She wants the music, too.
Thank you very much.
