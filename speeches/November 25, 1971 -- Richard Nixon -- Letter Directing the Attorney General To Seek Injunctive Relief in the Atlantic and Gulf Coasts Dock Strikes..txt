    Dear Mr. Attorney General:
On October 4, 1971, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (19 U.S.C. 176), I issued Executive Order No. 11691, as amended October 5 1971 [Executive Order 11622]. This Order created a Board of Inquiry to inquire into the issues involved in longshore disputes affecting ports on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts, and in the Great Lakes Port of Chicago.
On October 6, 1971, I received the Board's written report in the matter, and on November 25, 1971, I received a supplemental report which indicates that there is little chance of a prompt settlement in the disputes on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. A copy of this report is attached.
In my opinion these unresolved labor disputes have resulted in strikes affecting a substantial part of the maritime industry of the United States, an industry that is engaged in trade, commerce, transportation, transmission or communication among the several States and with foreign nations. These strikes, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national health and safety.
Therefore, in order to remove this peril and to secure a resumption of trade, commerce, transportation, transmission or communication among the several States and with foreign nations, I direct you, at this time, pursuant to the provisions of Section 208 of the Labor Management Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 178), to petition in the name of the United States in any District Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties to enjoin the continuance of such strikes at ports on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and for such other relief as may in your judgment be necessary or appropriate.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable John N. Mitchell, The Attorney General, Washington, D.C.]
