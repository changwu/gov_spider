    The President. We certainly wish you well, and we're proud of the way you've been received by the General Assembly and the Security Council. And we wish you all the best in the future. And the U.N. is so much more relevant now given its leadership and whole peacekeeping and peacemaking field. And I just think you're coming in at a most interesting time. The U.N. is very fortunate you are there.
Secretary-General-Elect Ghali. Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. Mr. President, some of the figures out for the fourth quarter aren't looking so great.
The President. You missed what I said earlier. I know you did because I said we're having a press conference at 2 p.m. Nice try though. [Laughter]
