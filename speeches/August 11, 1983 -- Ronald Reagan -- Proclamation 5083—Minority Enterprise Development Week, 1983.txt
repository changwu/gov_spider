  A Proclamation

The entrepreneurial spirit underlies our free enterprise system and is one of the principal sources of America's strength.
Ownership of one's own business is an aspiration held by many Americans. Minority Americans share fully in this aspiration. The success of minority business enterprise demonstrates that hard work and individual determination can serve as a powerful engine for social mobility and economic progress.
As a Nation, we are indebted to minority entrepreneurs for their contributions to our economic well-being. They bring innovative products and services to the marketplace, create jobs, and provide training to thousands of workers.
Our challenge today is to enhance the ability of minority Americans to participate more fully in the market economy and to achieve greater economic independence.
In my December 17, 1982, statement, I promised to designate the first full week in October each year to honor the many valuable contributions minority businessmen and businesswomen make to our society.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 2 through October 8, 1983, as Minority Enterprise Development Week, and I call upon all Americans to join together with minority business enterprises across the country in appropriate observances.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 11th day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
