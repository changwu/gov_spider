Iowa voters are used to braving frigid weather, but 13 degrees below zero? That's cold even by Midwestern standards.
That's how cold it was this morning in Decorah, Iowa, up in the northeastern corner of the state.

And yet 250 Iowa caucus goers braved the cold to come see what Marco had to say early on a holiday Monday.

By the time of Marco's next event, it was up to -10 — and he had another big crowd waiting.

That's the kind of momentum Marco has right now.
