    Today the Republicans and Democrats in Congress shared their priorities for a bipartisan spending agreement. The American people deserve a government that funds our great military, protects our borders, and leads to a more prosperous future for all. It is important that we achieve a two-year agreement that funds our troops and provides for our national security and other critical functions of the Federal government. It also remains important that members of Congress do not hold funding for our troops hostage for immigration policy. We've been clear about these budget priorities from the beginning and hope that further discussions will lead to an agreement soon.
