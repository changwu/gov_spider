    Congressman Dave Camp (R-MI) today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Mitt made an excellent choice. Â Paul is a tireless advocate for the policies we need to strengthen our economy and help restore the American Dream. Together, they provide the vision, inspiration and know-how to get America working again, fix Washington by cutting wasteful spending, and reduce our national debt."
