    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kolbe (R) AZ and Udall (D) AZ)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5675, which would extend the boundaries of the Saguaro National Monument by some 3,600 acres. The National Park Service has not had the opportunity to determine the merits of the proposal given the lack of time available to bbtain information about the area to be added to the Monument. Cost estimates for the large amount of land to be acquired have ranged from $10 to $30 million. Given existing budgetary constraints, expansion of Saguaro National Monument must be carefully evaluated against other land acquisition priorities.
