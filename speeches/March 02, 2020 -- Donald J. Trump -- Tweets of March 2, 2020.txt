Mini Mike Bloomberg didn't bring NYC back, as he said in his fake ad. It was @RudyGiuliani who brought NYC back and who also, with his endorsement, got Mini Mike elected (with barely a thank you). A boring mayor who the people couldn't stand!Retweets: 19176Favorites: 75730

The Black community brilliantly turned their backs on Mini Mike because they know he is a pandering phony who never did right by them! https://t.co/OERuf0ZKOkRetweets: 15842Favorites: 60082

Sleepy Joe Biden also said that guns killed 150 million Americans last year, wants to win Georgia on Super Tuesday (not up), and got his speaking location wrong again! https://t.co/INuGY214xaRetweets: 11959Favorites: 41294

Watch Mark Levin interview of Charlie Kirk tonight at 11:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Amazing!!! And, while you're at it, go get Charlie's new book, "The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future"...This is a really GREAT book. Support Charlie Kirk!Retweets: 14386Favorites: 63725

"Ever since (Mini Mike) Bloomberg's bad debate performances, his support has dropped." @abcnews Dropped a lot. Only his highly paid consultants, who are laughing all the way to the bank, still support him...And by the way, he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!Retweets: 11258Favorites: 49529

I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn't have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm & vigilant!Retweets: 36366Favorites: 160145

Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of GE, a business legend, has died. There was no corporate leader like "neutron" Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife & family!Retweets: 15699Favorites: 81469

As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don't, putting us at a.....Retweets: 15638Favorites: 62730

.@FoxNews is working hard pushing the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats. They want to be, unlike their competitors, @CNN & MSDNC (Comcast), Fair & Balanced. When will they ever learn. The Radical Left never even gave @FoxNews permission to partake in their low rated debates!Retweets: 13120Favorites: 53181
