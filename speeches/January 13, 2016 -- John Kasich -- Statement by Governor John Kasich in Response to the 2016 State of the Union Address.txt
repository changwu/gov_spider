    Gov. John Kasich released the following statement in response to the State of the Union address delivered by President Obama on January 12, 2016:
"We're going to cut taxes, balance the budget and get government out of the way so every American can rise. We're also going to strengthen our military and renew our alliances to proclaim the values of the civilized world and stand up to extremists and bullies. On-the-job training in this presidency has marched us down a trail of failure and left America weaker, divided and adrift. That's going to end and by working together we're going to fight, win and succeed."
