    Today Bill Bartlett, former President of the New Hampshire Senate, and former New Hampshire State Senator Mark Hounsell endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President.
Said Bartlett: "I have taken a careful look at all the candidates running for the presidential nomination and have found that Gov. Kasich is best suited to be the next President of the United States. He has a proven record of success in balancing budgets and knows how to work with Congress to solve the problems that not only face my generation, but my children's and my grandchildren's generations as well."
In addition to serving as President of the New Hampshire State Senate, Bartlett has also served as the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development and the Director of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. He joins another former New Hampshire Senate President, Ed Dupont, in placing his support behind Governor Kasich.
Said Hounsell, "As have many Granite Staters I have spent a great deal of time listening to and observing the manners of the many Republican candidates vying to be the next President of the United States. It is clear to me the candidate with the most executive experience, the best skill set, an impressive record of accomplishments and the proper character is Governor John Kasich. It is my pleasure to endorse him in the 2016 NH presidential primary."
In addition to his time in the New Hampshire Senate, Hounsell has served as a selectman in the town of Conway and on the Conway School Board.
"It's an honor to welcome former Senate President Bartlett and former Senator Mark Hounsell to the team in New Hampshire," said Kasich. Few people know New Hampshire as well as they do, and their expertise will help us engage more voters in the final weeks before the primary election. We're gaining momentum quickly and feeling confident about our chances in New Hampshire."
