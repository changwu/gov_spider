    The President announced today that he intends to nominate law professor and arbitrator William Gould to the National Labor Relations Board.
"William Gould has a tremendous amount of both practical and scholarly experience in labor law," said the President, "and stands for the principles I want the NLRB to uphold: the rights of all workers to participate in labor organizations and the need for labor and management to work together to increase our Nation's competitiveness in a global marketplace. I think that he will be an excellent addition to the Labor Relations Board."
