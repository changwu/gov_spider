Travel pool #1 — Lid
Hello from Rehoboth Beach where we have a calm and mild morning. After an initial call time of 10:00 am that was pushed back to noon, we were given a travel/photo lid at 10:13 am.
No indication of any events for today.

Travel report #3 — beach walk 
The pool reassembled near the president's residence around 4:52 pm and spoke with POTUS briefly while he took Commander on a walk through the neighborhood.
President Biden said he'd been the phone for most of his stay and alluded to progress getting test kits out before heading off toward the beach.
Pool then looked on as Commander was let off leash and had a good run by the water.

Travel pool #3a — additional quotes 
POTUS and FLOTUS left the beach at 5:13 pm and the pool broke off as he walked home.
On the way home, the president took a few more questions:
Asked when he would make a decision on domestic vaccine requirements he said "when I get a recommendation from the medical team."
Asked if he would be personally meeting with Putin later in January, he said "we'll see."
And asked if he had spoken with Senator Joe Manchin he replied "I have not."
**Some additional quotes from before the beach walk:
On the earlier question regarding distributing test kits, he said the administration had made "a bit of progress."
Finally, asked about Commander, he said that Commander was originally a rescue but he hasn't seen his papers. He added that Commander was now fifteen weeks old and that he was a present from his brother for his recent birthday.
