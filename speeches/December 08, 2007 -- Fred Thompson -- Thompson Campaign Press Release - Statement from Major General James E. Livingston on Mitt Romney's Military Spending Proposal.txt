    McLean, VA - The Friends of Fred Thompson campaign released the following statement from Veterans for Fred Chairman, Major Gen. James E. Livingston about Governor Mitt Romney's military spending proposal he addressed yesterday at Fort Des Moines:
"Governor Mitt Romney's proposal to increase military spending is just numbers with no specifics, no rationale, and no articulation of the challenges our country faces. This plan shows a lack of understanding of what must be done to revitalize our armed forces so they are able defeat the terrorists, deter adversaries, and preserve the peace in the years ahead.
"Our troops, veterans and their families deserve a Commander in Chief who is ready on Day One, not someone who needs on-the-job training when it comes to foreign affairs and national security.
"Fred Thompson will be ready to lead the minute he is sworn in, and that is why I am supporting him for President."
General Livingston is a Medal of Honor recipient who did three tours of combat duty in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Purple Heart and three other awards, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Superior Service Medal and the Bronze Star and serves as National Co-Chair of Veterans for Fred Thompson.
