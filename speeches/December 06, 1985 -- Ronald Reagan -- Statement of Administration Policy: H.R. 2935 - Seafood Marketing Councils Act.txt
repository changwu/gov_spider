    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Breaux (D) Louisiana and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2935 because it provides a role for the Federal Government in promoting and marketing seafood products. The Administration does, however, support the concept of industry organized and funded organizations for carrying out research and promotion activities to improve the marketing of seafood products, but believes that such activity should be conducted without Federal involvement.
