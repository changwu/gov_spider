    Dole/Kemp "96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"Bill Clinton likes his tax increases like his McDonald's meals...Supersized. As President, Bill Clinton has proposed 269 tax and fee increases topped by his world record $ 241 billion tax hike in 1993. In contrast, Bob Dole's record includes voting against at least 60 tax increases and authoring the largest tax cuts in history -- the Reagan tax cuts which reduced taxes more than $ 2.5 trillion.
"Perhaps even more telling than their records are the recent actions of the two men. Bob Dole has put forth a plan that provides a fair 15 percent across-the board tax cut, balances the budget, and keeps Medicare and Social Security off the table. Just yesterday, Bill Clinton left the door open to yet another massive tax increase. America can't afford four more years of Bill Clinton.
