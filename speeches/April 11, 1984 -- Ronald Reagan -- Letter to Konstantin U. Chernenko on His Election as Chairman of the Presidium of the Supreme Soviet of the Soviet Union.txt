    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Please accept my congratulations upon your election as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Our two countries bear a special responsibility toward our fellow human beings, both of this generation and of generations yet to come. We must ensure that our differences, however large, are resolved without the use of force and we must seek to build a better set of relationships based on those values that are common to all mankind. As you assume your new duties, I want to assure you that the United States remains ready to pursue a constructive dialogue aimed at reducing the risks of war and the levels of armaments, resolving regional conflicts peacefully and promoting trust and confidence which will enable the people of our two countries, and of the world, to live freer and more prosperous lives.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
