    WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Today, Dr. Rahul Gupta, Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), issued the following statement regarding the CDC's release of provisional drug overdose death data, which show 107,622 predicted overdose deaths in the 12-month period ending in December 2021.
"It is unacceptable that we are losing a life to overdose every five minutes around the clock. That is why President Biden's new National Drug Control Strategy signals a new era of drug policy centered on individuals and communities, focusing specifically on the actions we must take right now to reduce overdoses and save lives. Those actions include expanding access to high impact harm reduction tools like naloxone, quickly connecting more people to treatment, disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking operations, and improving data to systems that drive the Nation's drug policy."
In April, President Joe Biden sent his Administration's inaugural National Drug Control Strategy to Congress, which delivers on the call to action in President Biden's Unity Agenda through a whole-of-government approach to beat the overdose epidemic. It proposes targeted actions to expand access to evidence-based prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery services while reducing the supply of drugs like fentanyl.
