New laws won't stop criminals intent on committing violence, Marco said:
None of these crimes that have been committed, or in this case, what I believe was a terrorist attack in California, would have been prevented by expanded background checks. The fact of the matter is, these individuals would've passed expanded background checks . . . .
None of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years that have outraged us, would gun laws have prevented them. In fact, many of them existed despite the fact that local jurisdictions had gun laws even stricter than what you find in other jurisdictions. We have a violence problem in America, and we should be concerned about the violence . . . .
If you look at it more broadly, I think the fundamental question needs to be, why is there so much violence in America? It is a combination of cultural changes that have occurred in our country, and mental health issues as well.
Marco supports efforts to strengthen our mental health system and more vigorously identify and combat homegrown terrorism.
He opposes efforts to target law-abiding gun owners.
