    Republicans and Democrats in Congress have their differences, but when it comes to Katie, they're united in their admiration and respect. She came into her role at a time when we needed to build up our relationships with folks in both parties. And from bipartisan budget agreements to protecting a deal that will prevent a nuclear Iran, to ensuring the long-stalled Ex-Im and IMF reforms were enacted, we simply could not have made the progress we've made without her. It's never easy to lose a close adviser, and it's even harder when they've become a good friend. That said, there's nobody better prepared to step into this role than Amy Rosenbaum, and I'm very pleased she's agreed to serve as my next head of Legislative Affairs.
