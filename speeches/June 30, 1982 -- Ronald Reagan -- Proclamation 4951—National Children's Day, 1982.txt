  A Proclamation

As the inventors, artists, teachers, farmers, businessmen and women, decisionmakers, and leaders of tomorrow, children are our most important resource.
But children need parental love and guidance to reach their fullest potential, and they function most successfully when parents define values, set goals, and provide stability for them.
As parents fulfill their responsibility to love, encourage, and guide their children, youngsters have the opportunity to develop the self-esteem and competence that equip them to make sound decisions when they become adults.
National Children's Day provides a time for us to recognize the value, vitality, and potential of our young people. It is a day to recommit ourselves to nurturing our youth and to helping them achieve a healthy and happy future. We must strive to encourage our children to take advantage of opportunities for positive educational experiences and training, for the manner in which our children grow and learn will dramatically affect how our Nation is able to meet its future challenges.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States, in accordance with House Joint Resolution 191 (Public Law 97-29), do hereby proclaim August 8, 1982, as National Children's Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate activities in their homes and communities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 30th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
