    President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump extend their deepest sympathies to all those affected by yesterday's boating accident on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri. Tragically, a tourism boat sank during a storm while out on the lake, killing 17 people and injuring several others. Our prayers are with the victims and their loved ones. We are thankful for the brave first responders and dive crews, whose quick and decisive actions have saved many lives, and we continue to pray for their safety as their search, rescue, and recovery operations continue. Since the incident occurred, the Administration has been in contact with Governor Parson and other State and local officials, and the President will continue to monitor and receive regular updates on the situation.
