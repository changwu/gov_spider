    While the House of Representatives failed to defeat the Gephardt amendment today, I am pleased by the size and strength of the vote against protectionism and mandatory retaliation called for by this amendment. The strong leadership from those committed to free and fair trade sends a clear signal: that protectionism is not the way to resolve our trade imbalance. As this bill continues to move through Congress, we will work with them to craft a bill that will not put us on a collision course with the world and ignite a series of trade wars.
