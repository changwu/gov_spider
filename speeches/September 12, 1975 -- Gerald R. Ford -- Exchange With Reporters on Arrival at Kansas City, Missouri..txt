    IT IS delightful to be in this part of the country. We love it, and we are coming back next August, and we are looking forward to a very successful convention. We are just delighted to have the opportunity to be here in the Middle West.
REPORTER. Mr. President, can I ask you why you dropped the reference about holding America hostage in the last part of your speech in St. Louis?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't recall any--you mean in the comments to the White House Conference? I decided that I had followed the script sufficiently in various speeches, and I thought I would incorporate some shortened version, give the people more opportunity to ask questions. And so I just condensed it.
Q. Do you still feel that way, sir?
THE PRESIDENT. I feel that what I said was the thing I wanted to say, and I felt it was better that more people had an opportunity to ask questions than for me to make a speech.
It is really nice to see you all.
