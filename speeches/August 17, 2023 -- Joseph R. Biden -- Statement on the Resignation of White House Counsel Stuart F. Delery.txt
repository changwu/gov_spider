    Stuart Delery has been a trusted adviser and a constant source of innovative legal thinking since day one of my administration. From his work during those early days on COVID-19 and efforts to get lifesaving vaccines to the American public to the implementation of major legislative accomplishments such as the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, he has been an integral part of my team and will be missed throughout the administration. I extend my thanks to Stuart and his family for his service.
