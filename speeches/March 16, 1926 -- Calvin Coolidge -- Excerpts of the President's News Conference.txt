    The condition of my father seems to be about the same. I suppose he is gradually growing weaker. There doesn't appear to be any noticeable change. Some days he is a little stronger and brighter and takes more nourishment, and other days he seems to be weaker and doesn't take much nourishment and doesn't converse much with anyone unless they speak to him.
