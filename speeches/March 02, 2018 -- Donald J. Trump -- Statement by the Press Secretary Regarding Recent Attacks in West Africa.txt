    The United States strongly condemns the brutal attacks in West Africa that have occurred over the past few weeks, including the kidnapping by terrorists of more than 100 school girls and the murders of aid workers in Nigeria, the terrorist attack against United Nations peacekeepers in Mali that killed 4 people, and today's attacks in Burkina Faso that claimed many innocent lives and wounded dozens. The United States extends our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and wishes a speedy recovery to those wounded. These attacks only strengthen the resolve of the United States and responsible nations to pursue, destroy, and rid the world of those who commit such heinous acts.
