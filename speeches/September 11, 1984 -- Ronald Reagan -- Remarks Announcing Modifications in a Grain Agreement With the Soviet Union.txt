    Well, listen, I'm very happy to welcome all of you back, and I'm looking forward to discussing some important farm issues with you. But first, let me share some news with you for America's farm community.
Consistent with the long-term agreement on grain sales, we've decided—and the Department of Agriculture is notifying the Soviet Union—that the Soviets can increase by 10 million metric tons their purchase of wheat and or corn for shipment during the second year of the agreement. And the ceiling for the second year of agreement is being raised to 22 million metric tons. And I've said many times, our philosophy is against the unfair and the wrong-headed policies of grain embargoes, and we're going to continue to do everything we can to strengthen markets for America's farmers. They're the most productive people, I think, on the face of the Earth.
So, I just thought that you'd like to have that news.
