    IN RECOGNITION Of National Civil Service Week and the Fifty-fifth Anniversary of the enactment of the Federal Civil Service Act of 1883, I am glad to state once more my convictions with regard to the merit system for the federal government.
I have recommended and I support legislation for the extension of classified civil service upward, outward, and downward.
I have recommended and I support the policy for extension of the Classification Act to insure equal pay for equal work in the field services.
I have recommended and I support legislation to perfect the merit system in the central agency and in departments with ample safeguards to insure the proper use of discretionary powers needed by those who shall administer the system.
I conceive the establishment of a sound national personnel program to be one of the most important constructive steps in the improvement of government administration today.
