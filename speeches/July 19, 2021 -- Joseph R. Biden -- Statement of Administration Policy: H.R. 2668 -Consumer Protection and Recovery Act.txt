    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Cardenas, D-CA, and 18 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act. This legislation would expressly authorize the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to seek permanent injunctions and pursue equitable relief for all violations of law enforced by the Commission.
One core mandate of the FTC is to protect consumers from fraud and deception in the marketplace. Accordingly, H.R. 2668 would clarify the Commission's range of tools to provide relief to consumers and put a stop to unlawful business practices. The legislation amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide the FTC with explicit authority to require bad actors to return money earned through illegal activity and to seek both injunctive and monetary relief for consumers in Federal courts.
The Administration applauds this step to expressly authorize the FTC to seek permanent injunctions and pursue equitable relief for all violations of law enforced by the Commission and ensure that the cost of illegal practices falls on bad actors, not consumers targeted by illegal scams.
