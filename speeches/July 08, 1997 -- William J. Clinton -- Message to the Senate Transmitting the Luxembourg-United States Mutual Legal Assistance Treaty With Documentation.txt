    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Washington on March 13, 1997, and a related exchange of notes. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties that the United States is negotiating in order to counter criminal activity more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of modern criminals, including those involved in drug trafficking, terrorism, other violent crime, and money laundering, fiscal fraud, and other "white-collar" crime. The Treaty is self-executing.
The treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: taking testimony or statements of persons; providing documents, records, and articles of evidence; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; locating or identifying persons and items; serving documents; executing requests for searches and seizures; immobilizing assets; assisting in proceedings related to forfeiture and restitution; and rendering any other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the Requested State.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, July 8, 1997.
