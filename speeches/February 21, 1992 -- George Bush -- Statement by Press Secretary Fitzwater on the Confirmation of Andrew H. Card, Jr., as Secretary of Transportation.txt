    The President is delighted that the United States Senate unanimously voted to confirm Andrew Card to be Transportation Secretary. As Transportation Secretary, Andrew Card will be a leader in the administration's drive to create jobs, increase economic growth, and prepare America for a bright future.
I am sure that Transportation Secretary Card will ensure that America continues to travel safely home and abroad and that the Nation's transportation systems are ready to move into the 21st century.
