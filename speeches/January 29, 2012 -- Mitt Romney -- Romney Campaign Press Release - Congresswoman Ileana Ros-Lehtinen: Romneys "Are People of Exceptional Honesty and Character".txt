    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's comments about Mitt Romney's character:
"I have come to know Mitt Romney and his family well. They are people of exceptional honesty and character. These last minute attacks against Governor Romney are most unfortunate. Honesty and character are important traits for the next president to have. In that regard, Mitt Romney is the clear choice."
