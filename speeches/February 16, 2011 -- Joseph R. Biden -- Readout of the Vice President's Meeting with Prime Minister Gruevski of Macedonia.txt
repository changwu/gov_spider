The Vice President thanked the Prime Minister for Macedonia's contributions to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, where it is one of the highest per capita troop contributors. The Vice President expressed the hope that Macedonia and Greece resolve together the longstanding "name issue" so that Macedonia can move forward on seeking NATO membership and fulfilling its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
