    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with sections 202(c) and (e) of The District of Columbia Financial Management and Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Request Act.
The proposed FY 2003 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For FY 2003, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $5.7 billion.
