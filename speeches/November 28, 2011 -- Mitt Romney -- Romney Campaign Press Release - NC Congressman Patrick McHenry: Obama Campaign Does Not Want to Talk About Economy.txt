    North Carolina Congressman and Mitt Romney supporter Patrick McHenry made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"It is clear why the Obama campaign does not want to talk about the economy: President Obama's policies have been categorical failures. On jobs and spending, this Administration has not met its promises. And so instead of trying to create jobs and help the middle class, the Obama campaign has resorted to trying to tear down Mitt Romney. They would rather try and distract voters than try to defend three years of failure."
