    THE PRESIDENT said:
"It should be understood that the unprecedented drive now in progress for new legislation and for expansion of established services which increase expenditure beyond the budget, only in a small percent originates with Members of Congress or heads of Government departments. It originates from different sections of the country itself and from various groups and organizations, each vigorously supporting their own Projects. Many of these projects are worthy and no doubt can and should be undertaken sometime over future years, especially when funds are free by completion of legislation already adopted.
"I hope that the people at home will realize that the Government cannot undertake every worthy social, economic, military, and naval expansion, increases in pay to Government employees, expanded pension systems, or public improvement projects--and will support the Members of Congress in their cooperation with the administration to hold down these new proposals for additional expenditures. We have enough resources to take care of the budget and such necessities as marginal cases of disability among veterans and the speeding up of public works that we have undertaken to assist employment and some proposals of lesser importance. But this is no time for general expansion of public expenditure."
