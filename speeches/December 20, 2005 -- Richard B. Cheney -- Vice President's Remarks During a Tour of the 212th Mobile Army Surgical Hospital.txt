Q Your thoughts --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, it has been an amazing experience to see the extent of the devastation. This really was -- when you think about the number of dead and injuries, an area that had some -- leveled -- we all saw from the helicopter. But it's -- one of the remarkable things is how resilient the people are. I'm also, obviously, tremendously impressed with that we've been able to do with our MASH units and with U.S. forces able to move quickly into the area. We were here within 48 hours, and we've been here ever since. It's a measure of the enormous capability that the U.S. military is able to mount a humanitarian operation like this on a moment's notice.
Q America is doing enough?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're doing a great deal here, and it has been, I think, a remarkable success.
