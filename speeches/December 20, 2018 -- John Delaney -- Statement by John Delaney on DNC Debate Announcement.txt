    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD â€“ Today the DNC announced plans to host 12 debates during the 2020 presidential primary, beginning in June 2019. In anticipation of a large field, DNC Chair Tom Perez indicated that qualifying candidates would be placed on the stage by random selection in an effort to establish fairness.
Presidential candidate Congressman John K. Delaney (MD-6) releases the following statement:
"Chair Perez is an honorable man and I know that above all else he wants to establish a debate structure that is fair and on-the-level. What we should all want is for the voters to be able to make an informed decision. The details really matter and some details are still to be determined, but it is encouraging that the DNC is really embracing a fair process. Their initial proposal appears to be reasonable."
