Hillary Clinton: "I'm thrilled that I have my mother and my daughter with me tonight. My mother, Dorothy Rodham, my daughter, Chelsea Clinton.
"You know, as I travel around I see so many families who share the same values I was brought up with.
"My mom taught me to stand up for myself and to stand up for those who can't do it on their own.
"I'm proud to live by those values. But what I'm most proud of is knowing who I've passed them on to.
"I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message."
