    I am today sending to the Congress a request for an appropriation of $200 million to provide payments for the victims of flood damage caused by the collapse of the Teton Dam in Idaho. If additional funds are required, I will request further appropriations later.
These funds will complement our on-going Federal disaster assistance to provide further relief for injuries and damages inflicted by the flood. Claims will be administered by the Department of Interior, in accordance with regulations to be issued by the Secretary, and will be available to claimants at relief centers now in operation.
I urge the Congress to act promptly on my appropriation request to ensure that the victims of this tragic catastrophe can rebuild their lives and rebuild their communities.
I am also directing all Cabinet officers and heads of appropriate Federal agencies to work in close cooperation with the Department of Interior and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration to deliver this and other Federal disaster assistance to the people and to the communities unfortunately affected by this tragic catastrophe.
