    Ahead of Thursday's debate in Orlando, Florida elected officials have asked questions about Rick Perry's proposal to send Social Security back to the states.
Congressman Connie Mack (FL-14): "Rick Perry has said that he wants Social Security to go back to the states. Given the challenging budgetary situation many states are already in, his plan could put retirees and near-retirees in an even more precarious position. Would states like Florida have to choose between honoring our promises to seniors and paying for education and public safety?"
Congressman Tom Rooney (FL-16): "Social Security is a contract the American people have made with the federal government. The federal government needs to honor this contract."
State Senator John Thrasher (District 8): "We live in a mobile world. People are constantly moving from state to state. Does Rick Perry think it will be feasible for someone to expect to receive all their benefits when they have lived in many states over their lifetime?"
State Senator Anitere Flores (District 38): "Rick Perry is out of touch with the views of Floridians today. Dismantling Social Security would create uncertainty for our retirees and those near retirement. If Florida faces a budget shortfall, will seniors fail to receive the Social Security benefits they have earned?"
