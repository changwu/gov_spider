    Alexandria, VA — Today, Senator Lindsey Graham addressed the importance of protecting the valuable role that the early primary states play in vetting and testing the candidates, the danger of nationalizing the primary, and the Republican National Committee's responsibility to ensure that the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, and the South Carolina primary remain significant.
Joined by GOP activists, former New Hampshire GOP Party Chairmen, and political leaders from around the state at City Hall in Manchester, Senator Graham said, "We will meet the challenge. We're not giving up without a fight. Live free or die is the motto of this state... We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch our party make a fatal mistake at a crucial time."
Lindsey Graham 2016 launched a petition earlier this week that tells the media and Republican National Committee that all candidates should have their voices heard on the debate stage in an equal manner.
