    Middle East Peace Process
The President. Good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to have Chairman Arafat and his team back here again, and I'm looking forward to our conversation.
Q. Do you fear that the Palestinian track is in danger of collapse, Mr. President?
The President. No, I think it's an important moment, and we just have to keep working on it.
Q. Mr. President, are you going to put any pressure on the Palestinians concerning the third redeployment, which is supposed to happen on the 23d of this month?
The President. What I would like to do today is just get on to our business and our conversation and not say very much. If we're going to make peace, we're going to have to deal with the difficult issues, and the less we say now, the better, I think.
Q. Mr. President, President Arafat was reported to be very upset with the way the Israelis are handling the negotiation. What is your assessment now, especially as time is running out before the deadline of September 13th?
The President. I don't think I should characterize what's going on. I can only tell you that I want to finish the job, and I'd like to see it finished on time.
