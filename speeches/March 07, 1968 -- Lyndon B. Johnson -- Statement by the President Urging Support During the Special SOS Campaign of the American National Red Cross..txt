    SOMEONE is helping a wounded American now--in a field hospital in Vietnam.
Someone is bringing comfort to a soldier's family now--in any American city.
Someone is rescuing a drowning child-or saving lives with bottles of blood and a first aid kit--or caring for victims of disaster. That someone wears a Red Cross badge. The men and women of the Red Cross go wherever trouble or tragedy calls them. But someone is needed to help them, too. They need your support and your volunteer services-and they need them now. I ask all Americans to give all they can to the Red CROSS â€¢
