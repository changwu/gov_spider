    Dear Governor Edwards:
As requested, I have declared a major disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) for the State of Louisiana due to damage resulting from severe storms and flooding on January 20 through January 25, 1993. I have authorized Federal relief and recovery assistance in the affected area.
Individual Assistance will be provided. Public Assistance may be added at a later date, if requested and warranted. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs in the designated areas.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") will coordinate Federal assistance efforts and designate specific areas eligible for such assistance. The Federal Coordinating Officer will be Mr. Leland R. Wilson of FEMA. He will consult with you and assist in the execution of the FEMA-State Disaster Assistance Agreement governing the expenditure of Federal Funds.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
