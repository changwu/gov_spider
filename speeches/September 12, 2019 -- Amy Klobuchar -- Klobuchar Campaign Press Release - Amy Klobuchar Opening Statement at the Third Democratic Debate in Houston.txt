Read Sen. Klobuchar's Opening Statement:
"Good evening, Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here, the ten of us, is much stronger than what divides us. And I think that's true of our country, too.
"Now, I may not be the loudest person up here. But I think we've already got that in the White House. Houston, we have a problem. We have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead.
"I think we need something different.
"I am someone that tells the truth. I don't make promises that I can't keep, I have people's back and I believe that to win you bring people with you and that is how you govern, as well.
"So you're going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great, but if you see that some of them seem a little off track, I've got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me. Because I don't want to be the president for half of America -- I want to be the president for all of America."
