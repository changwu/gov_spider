    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (the Act) (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an exchange of Diplomatic Notes, together with the present agreement, extending the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signed at Washington on November 26, 1976, until December 31, 1986. The exchange of notes, together with the present agreement, constitutes a Governing International Fishery Agreement within the requirements of Section 201(c) of the Act.
In order to prevent the interruption of joint fishery arrangements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics when the current agreement expires on December 31, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this extension at an early date.
