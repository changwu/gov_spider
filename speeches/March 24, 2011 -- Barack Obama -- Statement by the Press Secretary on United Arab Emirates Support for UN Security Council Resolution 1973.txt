    The United States welcomes this important contribution by the United Arab Emirates to the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 in Libya. This critical participation by the UAE further underscores the broad, international support for the protection of the Libyan people. The UAE has been a leader on this issue within the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the UAE and all of our regional and international partners.
