    I want to thank all of the State, local, and Federal law enforcement officials whose hard work led to the surrender of the suspected "railway killer" earlier today. As a result of their determined efforts and the cooperation of Mexican authorities, the suspect is now in custody in the United States. All Americans can rest easier knowing that law enforcement authorities will bring the full force of the law to bear in this case.
