    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Schumer (D) NY and 128 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 796.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 796 could affect both direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget's preliminary estimate is that the net pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
