    Today, the President received the initial report, and work agenda, of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) from Secretaries Rice, Gutierrez and Chertoff.
The SPP was launched on March 23, 2005, at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, by President Bush, Mexican President Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Martin. The goal of the SPP is to develop a common security strategy and promote economic growth, competitiveness, and the quality of life of the citizens of our three great nations.
The three Leaders asked their appropriate ministers to consult with stakeholders, identify priorities, and report back within 90 days. Responding to this request, these ministers submitted a trilateral report setting forth specific and measurable goals, along with action plans for implementation.
President Bush commends Secretaries Rice, Gutierrez and Chertoff, and their Mexican and Canadian counterparts, for their hard work over the past few months. Their report represents an important first step in achieving the goals of the SPP. The President looks forward to the continuing work of the Partnership as our three countries begin to implement the recommendations of the report and continue discussions on other areas of cooperation.
