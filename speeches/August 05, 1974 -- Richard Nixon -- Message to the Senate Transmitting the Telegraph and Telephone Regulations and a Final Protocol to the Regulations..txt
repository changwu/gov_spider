    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Telegraph Regulations and the Telephone Regulations along with the appendices thereto and a Final Protocol to those Regulations, done at Geneva, April 11, 1973. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Regulations.
These Regulations are simplified, completely revised versions of the 1958 Regulations and will make it easier for the international business system guided by the Regulations to keep apace with rapidly advancing telecommunications technology.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to both the Telegraph Regulations and the Telephone Regulations and give its advice and consent to their ratification with the declarations proposed in the report of the Department of State.
