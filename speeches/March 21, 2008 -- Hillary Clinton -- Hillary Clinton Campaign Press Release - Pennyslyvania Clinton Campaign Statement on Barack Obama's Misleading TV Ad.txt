    PHILADELPHIA, PA - The Pennsylvania Clinton Campaign today released the following statement from Pennsylvania Communications Director Mark Nevins in response to Senator Barack Obama's misleading television ad running in the state. Below is a fact sheet on the advertisement.
"It's unfortunate that Barack Obama continues to talk about his leadership on ethics but doesn't have much action to back it up. Senator Obama's campaign still refuses to honor requests to disclose his tax and state records, and answer questions on inconsistencies with Tony Rezko. It's a continuing pattern of words with no action.
"Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has literally criss-crossed the state talking with the people of Pennsylvania about the issues that matter to them and what they're concerned about is results, not rhetoric. They're not interested in which candidate spends the most money. They want to know which candidate is best prepared to beat John McCain in November, create good, new jobs and provide everyone with healthcare. That candidate is Hillary Clinton."
