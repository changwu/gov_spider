Workers' jobs are not safe in Joe Biden's America.
Joe Biden pretends to be an advocate for union jobs, but his so-called "Build Back Better" plan and radical proposal to spend $2 trillion in four years on Green New Deal policies make it clear that union jobs related to oil, natural gas, fracking, and energy infrastructure will be on the chopping block in Joe Biden's America.
Biden cannot look union workers in the eye and tell them their jobs are safe. This isn't speculation. Good-paying union jobs and infrastructure projects are already being killed by Biden's supporters:

Biden promised to "proudly" kill the Keystone XL Pipeline project if he's elected, shutting down tens of thousands of jobs and spitting in the face of rank-and-file union workers who for years have supported the pipeline and the jobs that come with it.
Biden has remained silent while left-wing Green New Deal activists shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline, which is projected to have an "undeniably steep" cost to North Dakota's economy.
Biden supporters are campaigning against the Atlantic Coast pipeline, killing thousands of union jobs and taking away workers' paychecks.

"Thousands of hardworking LIUNA members, who spent years acquiring the skills to build the Atlantic Coast Pipeline safely and to the highest standards, now do not know where their next paycheck will come from," the Laborers' International Union of North America said in a recent statement. The left's war on energy infrastructure projects, they acknowledged, is "killing construction jobs by the tens of thousands for working families."
Biden isn't sticking up for these union workers and their families. In fact, he's the one placing a boot on their necks by embracing the job-killing Green New Deal despite opposition from rank-and-file union workers. "All it does is do what the Democratic Party seems to be very good at lately — which is export our jobs," one union worker said last year. Biden's extremism is only getting worse:Biden has become more radically liberal than ever, adopting Bernie Sanders' extremist platform nearly word-for-word. 
At a time when America's economy is making a comeback, Biden is proposing to kill millions of jobs, spike families' electrical bills, raise taxes, and heap tens of thousands of dollars in costs on households. It's a stunning display of economic incompetence from a man who oversaw the worst economic "recovery" since the Great Depression the last time he was in charge.
No wonder more Americans trust President Trump to bring back America's economy. They know President Trump will fight for every job and every industry, keep their taxes low, and stop the radical left's war on energy.
