    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Idaho and ordered Federal aid to supplement State, Tribal, and local recovery efforts in the area struck by flooding, landslides, and mudslides during the period of March 31 to April 11, 2011.
Federal funding is available to State, Tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the flooding, landslides, and mudslides in Bonner, Clearwater, Idaho, Nez Perce, and Shoshone Counties and the Nez Perce Tribe.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for all counties and Tribes within the State.
