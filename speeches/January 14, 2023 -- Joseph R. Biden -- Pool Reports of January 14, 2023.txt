Travel pool #1/Wilmington
Greetings from the first state, where it's barely above freezing, with a wind chill making it feel like 25 for your Covid-free pooler's coffee run.
The call time has been pushed from noon to 3:30pm.
There is nothing on President Biden's public schedule today in Wilmington.

Travel pool #2/on the move
The presidential motorcade pulled away from the Bidens' Wilmington neighborhood at 4:51 pm.
The pool joined from the holding spot. No way to peer into the garage from a mile away, though four or five deer were spotted in the field beside the road.

Travel pool #3/church
President Biden arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine church for 5pm Mass six minutes early.
The church is undergoing renovation from Jan. 9 to Feb. 20. Per its website, during the "Renew, Refresh, Rejoice church renovation project," Mass is being held at the Family Center next door.
The president was inside at 4:54.

Pool report #4/leaving church
President Biden emerged from the St. Joseph on the Brandywine Family Center, where Mass is being held during renovation of the main sanctuary, at 5:47 pm.
The sun is down and the wind chill is in the low 20s. Pool wisely chose to hold in the warm bus during the 5 o'clock Mass. Back on the lawn for departure, we were way too far to shout questions.
Motorcade rolled at 5:51.

Travel pool #5/back home
The presidential motorcade arrived back at the Biden residence in Wilmington in the dark at 5:57 pm after an uneventful 6-minute drive from church.
We could not see his SUV turn down his driveway.

That's it tonight from Wilmington.
