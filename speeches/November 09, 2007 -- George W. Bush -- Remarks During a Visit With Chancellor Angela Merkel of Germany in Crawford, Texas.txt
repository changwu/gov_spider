    President Bush. Laura and I are thrilled to welcome the Chancellor and Professor Sauer here to our place. In Texas, when you invite somebody to your home, it's an expression of warmth and respect, and that's how I feel about Chancellor Merkel. And so, Madam Chancellor, welcome. We're looking forward to having constructive talks as well as a chance to relax and visit.
Chancellor Merkel. Well, I would like to say a very warm thanks to you, George, for issuing this invitation to us. Already a first glance of the area shows us that this is, indeed, a wonderful place to be and a wonderful atmosphere. We have a number of issues that I think we will have now time to discuss later on. I'm very grateful that we can do this in such a pleasant, such a wonderful atmosphere and that we can see each other here again. And I must say that I'm, again, very grateful to you, Mr. President, for the fact that we can have this exchange of viewsâ€”and to you, Laura, as well. Thank you.
President Bush. Thank you. Here we go.
