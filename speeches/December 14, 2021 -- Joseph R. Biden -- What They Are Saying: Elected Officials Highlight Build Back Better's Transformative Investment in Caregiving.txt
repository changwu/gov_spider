    The average American family spends 60% of their monthly income on health care, housing, child care, and transportation. These costs hold families back from being able to fully participate in the workforce and provide their loves ones with adequate care.
President Biden promised to rebuild the backbone of the country – the middle class.
His Build Back Better Act makes the most transformative investment in children and caregiving in generations. It will lower the cost of things working families rely on, including childcare, elder care and preschool, while creating millions of good-paying jobs, enabling more Americans to join and remain in the labor force, and growing our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
Today, lawmakers expressed support the Build Back Better and urge its swift passage:
