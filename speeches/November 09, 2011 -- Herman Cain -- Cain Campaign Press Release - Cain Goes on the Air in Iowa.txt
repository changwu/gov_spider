DES MOINES, Iowa -- Herman Cain released his first television ad of the presidential cycle today, not surprisingly, in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa.
Unlike Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who have been running TV ads on local stations in Iowa, Cain's 60-second ad began airing on cable -- FOX News Channel to be exact.
"The new television ad is a result of the strong fundraising that has occurred over the last ten days," Steve Grubbs, Cain's Iowa chairman, told NBC News. "Our supporters are rallying to Herman Cain's defense and that means we will be able to take our message directly to voters."
The ad has three Iowa farmers and one former farmer discussing how EPA regulations are hurting their business amidst scenes of farmland and other Iowa landmarks.
"Over-regulation is killing the American farmer. I think Herman Cain is the answer," retired farmer Dean Kleckner says in the ad.
Kleckner served 10 years as president of the Iowa Farm Bureau, 14 years as president of the American Farm Bureau, and on the U.S. Trade Advisory Committee under three presidents.
"Herman Cain reminds me of Ronald Reagan and I knew Ronald Reagan. It is time to put the United back into the United States of America," Kleckner continues in the ad.
This release comes in the middle of the sexual harassment allegations against Cain that have been in the news frequently.
