    Urbandale, IA - From today's profile of Rick Santorum in the Des Moines Register, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) was quoted in describing Rick Santorum.
"U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, recalled how Santorum went the extra mile to win his support for landmark welfare reform legislation in 1996.
Grassley said Santorum, who was an author of the bill and its Senate floor manager, came to Grassley's office and patiently explained what he was trying to accomplish and why it was important.
"He took a lot of time to convince me of his point of view," said Grassley, who subsequently voted for the legislation.
Grassley said he sees many of those same political traits reflected on the campaign trail.
"I can say this: The sincerity and effort that he has to get his point across in the presidential campaign is almost a total reflection of how he operated as a United States senator," Grassley said. "He is transparent. A tough fighter. A person not afraid to take on tough issues."
