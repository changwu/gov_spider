    Today, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) sent a letter to senators urging the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. The Farm Bureau argues that the legislation will "boost the competitiveness of American Agriculture."
AFBF President Zippy Duvall wrote: "This bipartisan agreement includes several provisions designed to boost the resiliency of our farms, ranches and rural communities. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will enhance the efficient and cost-effective transport of agricultural and food products resulting in substantial contributions and opportunities for U.S. economic growth and trade."
AFBF joins national and local leaders, community groups, advocacy organizations, as well as large majorities of Republicans and Democratic voters, to urge the Senate to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
