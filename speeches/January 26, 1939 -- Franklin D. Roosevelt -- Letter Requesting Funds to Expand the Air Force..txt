    To the Speaker of the House of Representatives:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress three supplemental estimates of appropriation, totaling $50,000,000, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939, to remain available until June 30, 1940, for the War Department, to provide in part for the national defense program recommended by me to Congress in my message of January 12, 1939.
The details of these supplemental estimates of appropriation, the necessity therefor and the reasons for their transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Budget transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations I concur.
Respectfully,
