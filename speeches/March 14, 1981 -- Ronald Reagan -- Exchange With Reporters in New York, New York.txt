    Q. Mr. President, are you going to do anything to help mass transit in New York City?
The President. Well, in the first place, New York City—there are some areas in the country that will probably—well, those that are trying to start new rapid transit that will not fare as well as New York will, where there is an established system. So, we don't think anyone's really going to be hurt too badly. And we've also given the green light to Westway.
Q. Is this a fence-mending trip, Mr. President?
The President. No. I didn't think there were any fences here to be mended. I came up here to—Nancy had some things to do here and some things she's interested in, the drug program and so forth. And while we're going to have some entertainment, why, this is, I think, business.
Q. Senator Byrd says the most you're going to get is a 1-year tax cut. How do you respond to that?
The President. I just hope with all my heart that Senator Byrd is wrong, as he's been so many times in the past.
Q. For example?
The President. I've found him wrong on most issues. I take it we're not talking about Harry Byrd. [Laughter]
Q. No, Senator Robert Byrd, the minority leader.
Q. How about the Russians in Poland? Any movement there? The Russians in Poland?
The President. So far we see nothing, no evidence that this isn't just their exercise, the games.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
