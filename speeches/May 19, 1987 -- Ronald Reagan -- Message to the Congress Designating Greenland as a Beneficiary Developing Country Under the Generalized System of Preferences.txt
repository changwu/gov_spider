    To the Congress of the United States:
This is to inform you of my intent to add Greenland to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
On behalf of Greenland, the Government of Denmark has requested that GSP benefits be extended to Greenland. Prior to February 1985, Greenland was part of the European Community (EC) and thus not eligible for duty-free treatment under the GSP program. However, on February 1, 1985, Greenland was granted "home rule" by Denmark and now has the status of an "Overseas Country and Territory" of the EC. Subsequently, Greenland is no longer in a customs union with the EC and is eligible for GSP treatment. We have carefully examined this request with respect to the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502(b) and (c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria and particularly Greenland's level of development, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Greenland.
For your information, I am attaching a copy of the Government of Denmark's request that provides detailed information on Greenland relevant to the designation criteria of the Act.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
