    Mayor Rudy Giuliani released the following statement on World AIDS Day:
"Over 33 million people are infected with HIV around the world. More than 2 million people have died of AIDS in 2007 alone. Thanks to the dedicated health professionals, researchers, and innovators in the United States, many HIV-positive people are able to live longer and more fulfilling lives. But our work is far from done â€“ especially in addressing the unique challenge which HIV/AIDS presents to developing countries. As President, I will continue America's life-saving role as a leader in the global fight against HIV/AIDS until the day humanity can declare victory against this deadly disease."
