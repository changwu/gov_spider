    During the week of March 14, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall led a U.S.?delegation to Pristina, Kosovo. During the visit, Dr. Sherwood-Randall met with Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani-Sadriu and Prime Minister Albin Kurti and visited Camp Liya and Camp Bondsteel.
Dr. Sherwood-Randall reiterated the United States' steadfast commitment to Kosovo's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and regional security, as demonstrated through U.S. enduring leadership in NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR) mission and substantive support for the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) as it continues its 10-year transition plan. Dr. Sherwood-Randall expressed deep thanks to President Osmani and Prime Minister Kurti for Kosovo's ongoing support for temporarily hosting vulnerable Afghans at Camp Liya as they transition to future homes, for Kosovo's partnership in countering terrorism, and for Kosovo's acts of solidarity with the Ukrainian people.
