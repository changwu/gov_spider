    Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry met today with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as support for Ukraine's economy as it pursues reforms. The leaders reviewed their efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict based on the Minsk agreements, including through recent diplomacy by Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande. The Vice President noted that the costs to Russia should continue to rise if Russia refuses to accept a peaceful resolution and continues to escalate the conflict.
