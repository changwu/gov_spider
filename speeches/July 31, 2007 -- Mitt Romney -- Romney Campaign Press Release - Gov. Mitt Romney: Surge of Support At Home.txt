Democrats say they support the troops, but many don't support the work they are doing to make the surge successful. Representative Clyburn, the third-highest ranking House Democrat, said it would be a 'real big problem' for Democrats if progress is made in Iraq. That's not a problem but good news for all Americans."

Gov. Romney Stresses The Importance Of Winning In Iraq And Defeating Radical Islam Globally. ROMNEY: "The congressional debate in Washington has largely, and myopically, focused on whether troops should be redeployed from Iraq to Afghanistan, as if these were isolated issues.

THE DEMOCRATS: 'A REAL BIG PROBLEM' WITH SUCCESS IN IRAQ
House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) Said A Positive Iraq Report From Gen. Petraeus In September Would Prevent The Democrats From Declaring Defeat. "[Clyburn] said Monday that a strongly positive report on progress on Iraq by Army Gen. David Petraeus likely would split Democrats in the House and impede his party's efforts to press for a timetable to end the war. ... Clyburn noted that Petraeus carries significant weight among the 47 members of the Blue Dog caucus in the House, a group of moderate to conservative Democrats. Without their support, he said, Democratic leaders would find it virtually impossible to pass legislation setting a timetable for withdrawal." (Dan Balz and Chris Cillizza, "Clyburn: Positive Report by Petraeus Could Split House Democrats on War," The Washington Post, 7/30/07)
Rep. Clyburn: A Positive Report On Iraq Would Be "A Real Big Problem For Us." "'I think there would be enough support in that group to want to stay the course and if the Republicans were to stay united as they have been, then it would be a problem for us,' Clyburn said. 'We, by and large, would be wise to wait on the report.' ... Many Democrats have anticipated that, at best, Petraeus and U.S. ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker would present a mixed analysis of the success of the current troop surge strategy, given continued violence in Baghdad. But of late there have been signs that the commander of U.S. forces might be preparing something more generally positive. Clyburn said that would be ' a real big problem for us.'"

'I believe myself that the secretary of state, secretary of defense, and - you have to make your own decisions as to what the president knows - [know] this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq yesterday,' said Reid, a Nevada Democrat."
