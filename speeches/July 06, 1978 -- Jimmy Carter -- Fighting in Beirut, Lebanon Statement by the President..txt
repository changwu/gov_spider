    I wish today to express my deep concern at the continued bloodshed that has accompanied the fighting in Beirut over recent days. Despite appeals 'by Secretary General Waldheim and His Holiness the Pope—to which the United States has added its voice—and numerous efforts to achieve a cease-fire, the clashes unfortunately continue with heavy casualties among the innocent civilian population.
The fighting in Beirut is in no one's interest. It adds to the hatred and suffering accumulated over several years of tragedy in Lebanon and delays the efforts of the Lebanese Government, with the help and support of friendly governments, to rebuild national institutions and ensure security for all Lebanese.
I therefore join with those world leaders calling for an immediate end to the fighting and urge all parties with influence over the situation to spare no effort to set Lebanon once more on the road to peace and progress.
