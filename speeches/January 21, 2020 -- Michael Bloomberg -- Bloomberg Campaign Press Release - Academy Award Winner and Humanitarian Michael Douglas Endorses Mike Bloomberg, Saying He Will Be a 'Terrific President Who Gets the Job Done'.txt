    LOS ANGELES — Today, Academy Award winning actor Michael Douglas endorsed Mike Bloomberg for president, touting his executive and government experience as what is needed to unite the country and defeat Donald Trump.
Douglas expressed frustration with the current administration and said America needs a calm, measured, thoughtful and experienced leader who isn't going to have to learn how to govern on the job. He cited Mike's success in business and government, and that every American would benefit from his smarts, level-headed approach, and honesty.
"We need a sane and steady leader in the White House who will restore the dignity of the Oval Office and fix our broken government. Mike Bloomberg will get it done," said Michael Douglas. "His record in government and business speaks for itself. And he's championed the issues that matter most to Americans — fighting climate change, promoting public health and strong healthcare, taking on the NRA and creating good jobs."
"Michael Douglas is more than an award-winning actor and producer — he's a citizen activist who has supported common-sense gun safety laws and worked to promote international peace and security," said Mike Bloomberg. "I admire his work to make our world a better place, and I'm honored to have his support for our campaign."
Douglas played Democratic President Andrew Shepherd in the 1995 film The American President. Off the screen, he is also a Democrat.
Douglas is an American actor and producer. He has received many awards, including two Academy Awards (Best Actor for Wall Street, 1987, and Best Picture for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1975), five Golden Globes, a Primetime Emmy, and the AFI Life Achievement Award.
He also became a UN Messenger of Peace in 1998 and uses his position to raise public awareness against nuclear proliferation. He also supports stronger gun safety laws.
