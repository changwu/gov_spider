    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 1707. This bill provides that the Inspector General of the Tennessee Valley Authority is to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Current law provides for the appointment of the Inspector General by the Authority's Board of Directors. Under this legislation, the appointment of the Authority's Inspector General would be made consistent with the appointment of inspectors general at other large agencies. This is an appropriate change.
This bill also authorizes the establishment within the Department of the Treasury of a forensic laboratory to provide services to the Federal Government's Offices of Inspectors General. In implementing this legislation, my Administration will take care both to avoid duplication with other, ongoing forensic activities, and to ensure effective and efficient coordination and cooperation with existing Federal forensic laboratories, such as those operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and the Postal Service.
