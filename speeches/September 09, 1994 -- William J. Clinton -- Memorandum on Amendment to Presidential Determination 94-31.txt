Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is important to the national interest that funds previously made available from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of Haitian migrants be made available also for the urgent and unexpected needs of Cuban migrants, effective September 1, 1994. This determination amends Presidential Determination 94-31 of July 1, 1994, to permit the use of the funds authorized by that determination for Cuban as well as Haitian migrants.
You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under this authority and to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
