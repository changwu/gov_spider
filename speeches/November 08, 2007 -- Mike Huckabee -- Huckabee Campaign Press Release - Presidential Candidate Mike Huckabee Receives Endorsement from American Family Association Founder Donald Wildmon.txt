    Little Rock, AR - Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has received a significant endorsement from Donald E. Wildmon, founder of American Family Association (AFA). The AFA represents and stands for traditional family values, focusing primarily on the influence of television and other media – including pornography – on our society.
"I feel that Gov. Huckabee understands the needs of our country and has the ability to lead us in meeting those needs," Wildmon said.
"I'm proud to receive the support from such an influential member of the religious community," Huckabee said. "Rev. Wildmon and I share the same values on faith and family, which are key issues for the Republican party."
Wildmon, a retired United Methodist minister, is founder and chairman of the AFA. AFA, founded in 1977, has nearly 3,000,000 on-line supporters and owns and operates approximately 200 radio stations. The ministry employs approximately 160 individuals.
"This is a personal endorsement. It is not the endorsement of any group with which I may be associated," Wildmon said.
