    "President Obama has broken countless promises during his time in office - but none more important than his promise to help create jobs and get our economy moving again. From green jobs that never materialized to an unemployment rate that has remained above 8% for thirty-nine straight months, President Obama's rhetoric simply doesn't match with his failed economic record." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Candidate Obama Promised To Create Millions Of New Green Jobs - But His Energy Loans Have Resulted In Bankruptcies And Layoffs:
Candidate Obama, On Green Energy Investments: "An Investment That Will Lead To New Industries And Five Million New Jobs That Pay Well And Can't Ever Be Outsourced." OBAMA: "And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced."

"In a blow to the Obama administration's efforts to create green jobs, solar-cell maker Solyndra announced Wednesday that it will close its remaining Fremont factory, lay off its 1,100 employees and file for bankruptcy.  The news marked an abrupt end for a company once considered among the most innovative in a fast-changing industry. The bankruptcy also represents a high-profile failure for a federal stimulus program that gives loan guarantees to green-tech manufacturers. Solyndra was the first company to win one of the guarantees, receiving $535 million in 2009 to build its second factory in Fremont less than a mile from the company's original plant." (David R.
