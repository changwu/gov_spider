    I congratulate President-elect Stipe Mesic on his victory in Monday's elections in Croatia. Mr. Mesic's victory is a turning point for Croatia. It brings with it the promise of genuine democracy and a normal life for Croatia's people, stronger ties between our two nations, and greater stability throughout southeast Europe. The people of Croatia have clearly demonstrated their desire to see their country take its rightful place in Europe. The United States will do everything it can to help them reach their destination. And together we will send a clear message to all the people of the Balkans that a brighter future is within their grasp.
I look forward to working closely with President-elect Mesic, Prime Minister Racan, and the new government in Zagreb.
