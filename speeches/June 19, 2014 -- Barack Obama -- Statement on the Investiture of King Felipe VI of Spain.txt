    On behalf of the American people, I congratulate His Majesty King Felipe VI on the occasion of his investiture as King of Spain. We are grateful to King Juan Carlos I for his friendship and leadership in guiding Spain's democracy and deepening the transatlantic relationship.
Spain is a valued ally of the United States, and we share strong ties, steeped in history. I look forward to working closely with King Felipe VI and continuing to strengthen this bond in the years to come. As Spain celebrates this transition and looks ahead to the future, the American people celebrate along with the people of Spain.
