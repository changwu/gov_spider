    Melania, thank you very much. That was truly a beautiful and heartfelt speech. It's the way she feels -- very strongly.
America is truly blessed to have a First Lady who is so devoted to our country and to our children.
Over the past 15 months, Melania has visited hospitals, schools, families, who have suffered from the opioid crisis and suffered very deeply.
Everywhere she has gone, Americans have been touched by her sincerity, moved by her grace, and lifted by her love.
Melania, your care and compassion for our nation's children -- and I have to say this, and I say it to you all the time -- inspires us all.
Today, we pledge to be best -- best for our families, best for our communities and best for our nation. And now, I am proud to sign the "Be Best Proclamation", and I think you all know who's going to get the pen. Thank you. (Laughter and Applause).
[The proclamation is signed.] (Applause.)
Thank you everybody.
