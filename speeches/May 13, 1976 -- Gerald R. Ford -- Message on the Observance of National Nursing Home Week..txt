    IT IS vitally important to the strength and future progress of our society that those citizens in need of long-term institutional care--especially the elderly-be provided the best possible environment and attention during their period of recuperation or, in some cases, for the remainder of their lives. With this in mind, I want to salute the dedicated men and women who help to ensure proper nursing home care for those who require it.
It is encouraging to note the tremendous growth of the nursing home industry and the steady expansion of its critical role in promoting the well-being of our communities. The success we have realized is a tribute to the American spirit of concern for others and to our national willingness to work together for the common good.
On this special observance I commend the nursing home industry and express deep gratitude for its outstanding contribution to the quality of life in our country.
