    Memorandum for the Heads GI Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Federal Employment of the Handicapped
When I addressed the White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals, I said that our nation can no longer tolerate discrimination against the handicapped. That means that we must enforce regulations to make sure that all facets of our national life--whether transportation, education, recreation, architecture, or others--are open to all our people.
Perhaps the most important of these areas is employment. I intend that the government should set an example for fair employment practices, by demonstrating what can be done to make the fullest possible use of the abilities of qualified handicapped people.
This is not a new effort. The government has already made progress toward removing barriers to federal employment. But I believe that we can do more. I ask that you actively review your annual affirmative action plans for hiring handicapped people and disabled veterans. As part of your review, I ask that you study the actions being taken to meet your goals, and that you take any extra steps that may be necessary to fulfill our commitment.
Our society has a duty to provide equal opportunities for our people, and an enlightened government has a duty to lead the way.
