    SANTA FE, NM-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today addressed economic development issues in the Mississippi Delta.
"When I am President, the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) will have the full funding it requires-- $30 million per year," Richardson said. "I will give the Authority full sub-Cabinet status, and I will demand regular and direct briefings from the DRA's Chairman on the status of development programs."
Richardson criticized the Bush administration's failure to create jobs and develop the Mississippi Delta region's economy. The Delta region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.
"The Bush administration has ignored the Mississippi Delta for too long," Governor Richardson said. "I am committed to creating jobs for all Americans, and I am proud to have the most detailed jobs plan of any candidate running for President. I have turned New Mexico's economy around as Governor, and I will do so nationwide as President."
