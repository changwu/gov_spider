    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 budget amendments for the Department of Justice and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
In total, these amendments would not affect the budgetary resources proposed in my FY 2003 Budget.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
