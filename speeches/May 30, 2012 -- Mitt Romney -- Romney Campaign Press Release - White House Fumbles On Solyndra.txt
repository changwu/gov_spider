    "In the Obama economy, the government 'invests' taxpayer dollars in boondoggles like Solyndra, while attacking the free market and punishing job creators. Even the Obama White House can't explain the failed results of this strategy – wasted taxpayer dollars and lost jobs. It's no wonder more and more Democrats have shunned President Obama's attacks on free enterprise. You cannot be for jobs, and yet against job creators." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Yesterday, The Obama White House Struggled To Answer Questions About Their Failed Record Of Waste And Cronyism:
Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney Stumbled While Explaining The Obama Administration's Warped View Of Free Enterprise And Failed Energy Investments. Q: "If that's the argument how is that different from Romney's argument on Bain Capital which is that many succeeded and a few failed?" CARNEY: "Look...there, there, there is the...the... difference in that, your overall view of what...huh, your responsibilities are as president and what your view of the economic future is. And the president believes as he's made clear that a president's responsibility is not just to, ah, those who win but those who, for example in a company where ah, there have been layoffs or a company that has gone bankrupt, that we have to ah make sure that those folks have the means to find other employment, that they have the ability to train for other kinds of work and that's part of the overall responsibility a president has."
