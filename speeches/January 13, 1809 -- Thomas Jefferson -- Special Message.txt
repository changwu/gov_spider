    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I now render to Congress the account of the fund established for defraying the contingent expenses of Government for the year 1808. Of the $20,000 appropriated for that purpose, $2,000 were deposited in the hands of the Attorney-General of the United States to pay expenses incident to the prosecution of Aaron Burr and his accomplices for treason and misdemeanors alleged to have been committed by them; $990 were paid to the order of Governor Williams on the same account, and the balance of $17,010 remains in the Treasury unexpended.
TH: JEFFERSON.
