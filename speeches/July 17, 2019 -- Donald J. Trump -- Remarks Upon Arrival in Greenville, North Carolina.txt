    The President. So we just had a very big vote on impeachment, the most ridiculous project I've ever been involved in. We have the strongest economy in the world. We've rebuilt our military. We've knocked out regulations. We have the greatest tax cuts we've ever had—the biggest and best—including ANWR and including getting rid of a lot of different things that people didn't want.
We have just received an overwhelming vote against impeachment. And that's the end of it. Let the Democrats now go back to work. Thank you very much.
Q. Do you think Speaker Pelosi's afraid to impeach you?
