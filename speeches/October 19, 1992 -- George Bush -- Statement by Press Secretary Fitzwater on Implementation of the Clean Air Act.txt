    Today the Environmental Protection Agency is announcing that 41 more cities are attaining health standards for ground-level ozone (smog) and 13 more cities are attaining health standards for carbon monoxide. With over 35 million Americans breathing more easily than in 1988, this is a great American success story.
These improvements are due to a combination of cooler weather since 1988 and the actions this administration has taken in the last 4 years, including reducing the volatility of gasoline and passage of the Clean Air Act. The Bush administration is committed to continuing to clean our air through the full implementation of the Clean Air Act.
