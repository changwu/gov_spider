    HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri. Congresswoman Wagner has served as the Representative for Missouri's second Congressional District since 2013, was chair of the Missouri Republican Party from 1999-2005, and was co-chair of the RNC for four years.
"I am proud to endorse Senator Ted Cruz ahead of the GOP Primary on March 15th," said Congresswoman Ann Wagner. "Republicans must unite to win behind a strong, constitutional conservative like Ted Cruz. Missouri families deserve a trusted conservative leader like Ted Cruz who shares our values and will fight for us in Washington. I hope Missourians will join me in voting for Ted Cruz on Tuesday."
"Ann is a principled conservative who has spent a lifetime fighting for a stronger Missouri," said Cruz. "As a mother of three, a businesswoman, and fierce defender of our shared conservative values, Congresswoman Wagner is a wonderful addition to our team. Across the nation we are uniting the Republican Party, and I'm excited to have Ann's support in this Tuesday's critical Missouri Primary."
