We have some big things happening in our various litigations on the Election Hoax. Everybody knows it was Rigged. They know Biden didn't get more votes from the Black community than Obama, & certainly didn't get 80,000,000 votes. Look what happened in Detroit, Philadelphia, plus!Retweets: 61001Favorites: 277880

.@60Minutes never asked us for a comment about their ridiculous, one sided story on election security, which is an international joke. Our 2020 Election, from poorly rated Dominion to a Country FLOODED with unaccounted for Mail-In ballots, was probably our least secure EVER!Retweets: 42808Favorites: 189842

Democrats suffered crushing down-ballot loss across America. @nytimes. This is true. All statehouses won, and in Washington we did great. So I led this great charge, and I'm the only one that lost? No, it doesn't work that way. This was a massive fraud, a RIGGED ELECTION!Retweets: 60703Favorites: 268984

I'm not fighting for me, I'm fighting for the 74,000,000 million people (not including the many Trump ballots that were tossed), a record for a sitting President, who voted for me!Retweets: 84459Favorites: 496088

Why won't Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a goldmine of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state....Retweets: 46674Favorites: 194596

....Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots. You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!Retweets: 27436Favorites: 122980
