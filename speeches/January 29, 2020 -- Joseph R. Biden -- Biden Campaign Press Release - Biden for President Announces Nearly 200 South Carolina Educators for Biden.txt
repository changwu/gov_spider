    Columbia, SC – Today, Biden for President announced South Carolina Educators for Biden, which includes a chorus of nearly 200 educators from across the state who are endorsing Joe Biden for President. Palmetto State educators are announcing their support for Vice President Biden, citing his long record of demonstrated support for public schools, teachers, and students.
Biden has released a robust education plan that would invest in every child at birth, provide a path to careers for middle and high school students, provide more resources to schools, and give educators the pay and respect they deserve.
Last year, thousands of South Carolina educators courageously marched to the state capitol to demand just that from state lawmakers. Since then they have united and organized behind local leaders who prioritize an education policy that comes from the classroom. This group will undoubtedly boost our campaign's grassroots efforts on the ground with nearly 30 days left until South Carolina's primary.
Biden for President also named former Governor and Secretary of Education Dick Riley, former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum, and other education leaders as co-chairs of the campaign's South Carolina Educators for Biden effort.
"Joe and I are grateful for every leader who stands by us in this race, but as a teacher myself, I am especially proud of the many educators who have joined our campaign," said Dr. Jill Biden. "Joe understands that the best education policy doesn't come from politics —it comes from classrooms and the educators who do this work every day. He will honor our profession with the respect and dignity it deserves —and that includes appointing a Secretary of Education who has public classroom experience."
"I'm proud to stand with Joe Biden once again in the fight to improve our nation's education system and support our country's educators," said Dick Riley, former South Carolina Governor and former U.S. Secretary of Education. "He was an excellent partner in the Senate during my time in the Clinton Administration. I am confident a Joe Biden administration will not rest until every child, no matter their zip code or the color of their skin, has access to a high- quality education. Joe understands the necessity of making quality education accessible to everyone. With Joe as president and Dr. Jill Biden as first lady, teachers, and students will have two true education advocates in the White House."
"In his decades of public service, Joe Biden has always remained laser focused on providing students and educators the resources they need to succeed, said Inez Tenenbaum, Former State Superintendent of Education and Obama-Biden Administration Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. "As the husband of a teacher, he knows the challenges facing the education system and has a bold plan to address it."
