    Iowa has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, with cases surpassing 100,000 this week and COVID-19 hospitalizations hitting a new high. But President Trump isn't coming to the Hawkeye State to offer words of comfort to those suffering, or a helping hand to the Iowans who are out of a job, or an actual plan to get the virus under control. Instead, he's here to spread more lies about the pandemic and distract from his record of failure.
That's not good enough. Iowans whose lives have been thrown into chaos need real leadership — not more division. I've seen our country through dark times before, helping rescue an economy in crisis. And I've fought for the health care protections this administration is battling in the U.S. Supreme Court to undo. We're better than this moment under President Trump — and as President, I will bring this country together so that we can build back better.
