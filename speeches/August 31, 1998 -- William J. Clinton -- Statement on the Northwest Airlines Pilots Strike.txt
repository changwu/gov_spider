    I have asked Northwest Airlines and its pilots to redouble their efforts to resolve their differences. Senior members of my administration continue to be in contact with the parties, but it is up to the negotiating parties to reach an agreement. Specifically, I have asked Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater to meet with the parties' leadership. I hope that an agreement will be concluded soon in their interests and the interest of the American people.
