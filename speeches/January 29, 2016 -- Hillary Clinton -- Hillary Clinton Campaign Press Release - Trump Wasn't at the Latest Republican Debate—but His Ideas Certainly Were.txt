Something interesting is happening in the Republican presidential race: The closer we get to the Iowa caucus and the first primaries of this election, the harder it's becoming to tell the Republican field apart—because they're all sounding more and more like Donald Trump.
Case in point? Trump didn't have even have to attend the latest Republican presidential debate for his ideas to be center stage.
