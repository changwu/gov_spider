    The United States strongly condemns today's terrorist attack in Cairo that killed Egyptian Prosecutor-General Hisham Barakat and injured at least nine others. We offer our condolences to the family of Mr. Barakat, those injured in the attack, and the Government and people of Egypt. The United States stands by Egypt at this difficult time, as we continue to work together to fight the scourge of terrorism.
