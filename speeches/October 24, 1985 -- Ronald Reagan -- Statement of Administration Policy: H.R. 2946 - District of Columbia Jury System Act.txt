    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dymally (D) California and Bliley (R) Virginia)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2946 because it would establish a separate jury selection system for the Federal and local trial courts in the District of Columbia which would result in administrative difficulties, duplication of efforts, and increased costs to the Federal Government.
