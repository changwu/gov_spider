    Denver, CO â€” Newt 2012 announces its growing team in Colorado is going to be joined by longtime Republican activist, former University of Colorado Regent, and Larimer County GOP Chair Tom Lucero.
Lucero commented, "I have always admired Speaker Gingrich, particularly his leadership with the Contract with America. Because of his leadership Republicans were able to gain a footing in congress that has lasted almost continuously for two decades. I remember listening to his tapes while riding the campaign circuit in 1996. In addition to a vision for the conservative movement, Newt also provided the action that led to a Republican take over of congress."
Lucero continued, "as someone who spent twelve years fighting for conservative values at the University of Colorado, Newt is the one person who understands we are fighting on many fronts, including a cultural battle for the heart of America. Newt can articulate that vision of America and more importantly, will fight for that vision of America."
The campaign has already started focusing on the February 7 presidential straw poll, but is also keeping their eye on the prize -- delegates. "While we would like to win the straw poll, it's not nearly as important as getting as many delegates as possible. We have a long way to go and the only way we win is with delegates at the convention, not straw polls. Our goal is to deliver every delegate for Newt," Lucero concluded.
