    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith an exchange of Diplomatic Notes, together with the present agreement, extending the governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, signed at Washington on November 26, 1976, until July 1, 1983. The exchange of notes together with the present agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of Section 201(c) of the Act.
I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this extension at an early date. Several U.S. fishing interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement, and I therefore recommend that the Congress consider issuance of a joint resolution to bring this agreement into force, before the agreement expires on July 1, 1982.
