More evidence has been released that tax collectors singled out conservatives and critics of the Obama administration. Worse, the IRS has completely failed to make changes to halt the targeting of free speech based on the political and religious beliefs of conservatives.
It's no wonder the American people have completely lost confidence in the IRS.
Instead of wasting taxpayer dollars to target conservatives, the IRS must be dramatically downsized. We can start by simplifying the tax code and cutting the number of IRS bureaucrats, eliminating crony capitalist tax loopholes and lowering taxes, and repealing Obamacare.
