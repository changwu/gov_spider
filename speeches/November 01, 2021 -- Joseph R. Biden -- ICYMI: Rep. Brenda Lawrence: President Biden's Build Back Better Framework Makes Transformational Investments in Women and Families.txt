    Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, penned an op-ed for Ms. Magazine arguing that the Build Back Better Framework makes long-overdue historic investments in American women and families.
With the Build Back Better Framework, she writes, "We're making childcare affordable and accessible for mothers and fathers so no family has to pay more than seven percent of their income for this much-needed care. This will be life-changing for parents in my district in Michigan who have told me directly that childcare costs more than their home mortgage. That is the reality for so many hard-working American families, and that is the reality the Build Back Better Framework will change."
Rep. Lawrence highlights that the framework will also aid child care and home care workforcesâ€“ which are disproportionally women of color writing: "the president's agenda will boost the compensation of childcare workers to at least $15 an hour and help close the gender pay gap."
"I couldn't agree more with President Biden when he calls the Build Back Better Framework a once-in-a-generation investment in the American people," she concludes. "We're lifting women out of poverty, educating our children and lowering costs. This agenda is about who we are as a country and the values we represent."
