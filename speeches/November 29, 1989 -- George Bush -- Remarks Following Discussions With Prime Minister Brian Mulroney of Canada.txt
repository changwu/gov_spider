    The President. Let me just say that Prime Minister Mulroney has very generously come down here and given us a very full briefing -- his observations from a long and detailed trip that he took to the Soviet Union. I don't know why he is not more wiped out by jet lag, because I last saw him just a few weeks ago in Central America -- he'd come from Asia. Now he's been to the Soviet Union -- but it was most generous, Mr. Prime Minister, for you to come here. And on behalf of the Secretary of State and Brent Scowcroft, John Sununu, those of us who will be in the meetings, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your advice and your observations.
And it's a little unorthodox, but if you'll excuse me, I understand you're going to take some questions here.
The Prime Minister. I will.
The President. All right, thank you. And our love to Mila, and thank you, sir, very much. It was most generous of you.
The Prime Minister. Thank you very much.
