    Less than one week after announcing his run for president, Sanders eclipses goal of one million people signing on to support campaign
WASHINGTON -- Less than one week after asking Americans to join him as part of an unprecedented and historic campaign, Sen. Bernie Sanders has proven his grassroots support with over one million signing on in support of his campaign as of Sunday.
"I am thrilled that, in less than a week, more than one million people have signed on to volunteer and commit to do what it takes to win this campaign. We will win with the progressive vision we share, thanks to an unprecedented grassroots movement from coast to coast that has the courage to take on the powerful special interests that dominate the economic and political life of our country."
The sign ons include support from all 435 congressional districts in the country and 324,186 new people who were not part of Sanders' 2016 campaign.
This weekend, Sanders will hold the first events of his presidential campaign at Brooklyn College in Brooklyn, New York, and Navy Pier in Chicago, continuing to grow his base of support and speak directly to Americans about the need to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history, and what he has learned from his long history of fighting for economic, social, racial and environmental justice.
