  A Proclamation

Whereas certain lands comprising a portion of the hereinafter-described Gustavus Area of the Glacier Bay National Monument in Alaska, established by Proclamation No. 1733 of February 26, 1925 (43 Stat. 1988), and enlarged by Proclamation No. 23301 of April 18, 1939 (53 Stat. 2534), are now being used as an airfield for national-defense purposes and are no longer suitable for national-monument purposes; and
Whereas the other lands within the Gustavus Area, including several homesteads which were patented prior to the enlargement of the monument by the proclamation of April 18, 1939, are suitable for a limited type of agricultural use and are no longer necessary for the proper care and management of the objects of scientific interest on the lands within the monument; and
Whereas the lands comprising the hereinafter-described Excursion Inlet Area of the monument were erroneously excluded from the Tongass National Forest and included in the monument by the proclamation of April 18, 1939, and such lands are suitable for national- forest purposes; and
Whereas it appears that it would be in the public interest to exclude the said lands comprising the Gustavus Area and the Excursion Inlet Area from the Glacier Bay National Monument, and to restore the lands within the Excursion Inlet Area to the Tongass National Forest:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, c. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U. S.
