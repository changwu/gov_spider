    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Jeffords (R) VT and 15 others)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2432, which would authorize grants to States designed to improve access to assistive technology for people with disabilities. As we move into the 21st Century, it is important that Federal and State policies promote the design of products and environments that are readily useable by all Americans, including individuals with disabilities.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 2432 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB estimates that the net pay-as-you-go effect would be zero.
