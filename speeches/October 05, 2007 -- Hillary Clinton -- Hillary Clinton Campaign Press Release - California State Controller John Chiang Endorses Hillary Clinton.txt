    Chiang to Serve as California Co-Chair for Clinton Campaign
The Clinton Campaign today announced the key endorsement of California State Controller John Chiang who will serve as Co-Chair of Clinton's California Campaign. Chiang cited Clinton's sound economic policies and her commitment to creating well-paying new jobs as the reasons for his endorsement.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to help our local, state and federal economies flourish," said Controller Chiang. "I am pleased to join her team and I'm committed to helping get her elected."
As the chief fiscal officer for the eighth-largest economy in the world, Controller Chiang serves as the state's independent fiscal watchdog and oversees more than $100 billion in annual receipts and disbursements of public funds. He uses his audit authority to uncover fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars and provides fiscal guidance to our local governments. He helps administer $400 billion in state pension funds and among many other duties, he serves on 76 state boards and commissions, with responsibilities ranging from protecting our coastline to helping build new hospitals.
"I am honored to have the support of Controller John Chiang, a leader who believes that only by putting our country's fiscal house in order can we ensure our future security and growth," said Clinton.
Chiang joins other state leaders in endorsing Hillary Clinton, including State Treasurer Bill Lockyer, State Senate President Don Perata and State Assembly Speaker Fabian NuÃ±ez.
