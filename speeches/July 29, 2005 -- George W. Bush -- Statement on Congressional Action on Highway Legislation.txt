    I congratulate the Congress for completing a highway bill that will improve highway safety, modernize our roads, reduce traffic congestion, and create jobs. I am pleased that Congress met these objectives in a fiscally responsible way and without raising gas taxes. This important legislation will help provide the funding needed to carry out overdue work on critical highway and transportation projects, and it will strengthen and modernize the transportation networks vital to America's continued economic growth. I look forward to signing it into law.
