    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am pleased to submit for your consideration and enactment the "Honoraria Reform Act of 1989." This legislation would eliminate congressional honoraria over time by reducing the statutory ceiling on honoraria by 50 percent for calendar year 1990, and by eliminating honoraria altogether beginning January 1, 1991. Enactment of this legislation would put the legislative and executive branches on equal footing with regard to honoraria.
I have previously recommended a 25 percent pay increase for Federal judges, and today I am submitting separate legislation calling for pay increases for certain specialized professionals and other senior officials in the executive branch. The legislation to eliminate honoraria being proposed today is linked to the enactment by the Congress of a pay increase for Members of Congress. I will work with the Congress toward this end.
Sincerely,
George Bush
