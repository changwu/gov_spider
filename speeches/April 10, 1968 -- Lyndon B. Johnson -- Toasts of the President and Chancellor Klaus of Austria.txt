    Chancellor and Mrs. Klaus, Mr. Vice President and Mrs. Humphrey, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
In the dark days before World War II, the writer Stefan Zweig said of the disappearance of Austria from the map of Europe, "Nobody saw that Austria was the cornerstone of the wall and that Europe must break down when it was torn out."
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we celebrate what the Austrian people and their leaders have done to put that cornerstone back into the wall--so solidly that all of Europe is much stronger.
A native Austrian--Justice Felix Frankfurter-who became one of America's wisest men of law, liked to say that "there is no inevitability in history--except as men make it."
Perhaps never in the recorded ages of man has that been truer than in the era that we now live in. And perhaps that is both the greatness as well as the trial of our age.
We have seen in our era that men can make their own destiny.
We have seen men shape their destiny in countries that were once only colonies.
We see today the young people everywhere restlessly seeking to have a voice in their own future.
We have seen, on every continent, the unquenchable thirst for self-determination.
Nowhere has this appeared more clearly than in Austria--where a free and a proud people willed themselves a new nation out of the ruins of war.
Our guest this evening has played a leading part in showing that history is not inevitable, but rather responsive to the highest goals of the human spirit. He is a seeker of peace and harmony throughout Europe and around the world.
Mr. Chancellor, I can assure you that your efforts have not gone unappreciated in this city.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me this evening in a toast to the people of Austria, the President of the Republic of Austria, and to our most distinguished guest and his lady, Chancellor Josef Klaus.
