    America lost a national treasure today. Jimmy Stewart was a great actor, a gentleman, and a patriot. We will always remember his rich career of great performances that spanned several decades and entertained generations of Americans.
Like all Americans, Hillary and I will miss him greatly, but his works live on, and for that we can all be grateful.
