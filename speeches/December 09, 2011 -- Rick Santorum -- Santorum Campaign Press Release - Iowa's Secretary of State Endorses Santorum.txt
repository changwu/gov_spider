Urbandale, IA - Today Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum received the endorsement of Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz. Schultz is the first Iowa statewide elected official to endorse a Republican presidential hopeful. In 2008, Schultz endorsed Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for President.
Senator Santorum said: "I am honored to receive Secretary of State Schultz's endorsement today. Matt is a rising conservative star, not just in Iowa but for the entire nation. Matt built his own campaign for Secretary of State through grassroots campaigning and exciting activists - not through TV ads and occasional rallies in Des Moines. Matt went door-to-door, coffee shop to coffee shop and won over the people of Iowa. I learned from Matt Schultz how Iowa campaigns are run, and I am thrilled to have his vote of confidence today. I am excited to work with Matt over the next month as we execute our plan to win the Iowa caucuses."
Matt Schultz was elected in 2008 to Iowa's Secretary of State. Prior to his election in 2008, Schultz served on the Council Bluffs City Council from 2005 - 2008. Schultz has been committed to public service his entire life, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout and a twoyear Mormon mission to Argentina. Schultz holds an Associates Degree from BYU-Idaho, Bachelors Degree from the University of Iowa, and a Law Degree from Creighton University. Schultz and his wife Zola are the proud parents of three children: Levi, Hyrum, and Kendra.
