    Memorandum for Honorable Joseph C. Swidler, Chairman, Federal Power Commission
Today's failure is a dramatic reminder of the importance of the uninterrupted flow of power to the health, safety, and well being of our citizens and the defense of our country.
This failure should be immediately and carefully investigated in order to prevent a recurrence.
You are therefore directed to launch a thorough study of the cause of this failure. I am putting at your disposal full resources of the Federal Government and directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense and other agencies to support you in any way possible. You are to call upon the top experts in our Nation in conducting the investigation.
A report is expected at the earliest possible moment as to the causes of the failure and the steps you recommend to be taken to prevent a recurrence.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
