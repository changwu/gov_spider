    Chicago, IL -- On Wednesday, November 28, hundreds of women in key February 5th states will gather for events to kick off state-specific Women for Obama Leadership Committees and participate in campaign organizing activities. Michelle Obama will also lead a conference call and give a campaign update on the state of the national race for participating women.
Since the launch of Women for Obama in April, the group has played a key role in Barack Obama's campaign for President. By focusing on fundraising, grassroots and online organizing, Women for Obama has built a network of women who will play an instrumental role in sending Barack Obama to the White House.
The state-by-state committees in key February 5th states will join similar structures in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina set up to lead a national grassroots network of 20,000 women who are organizing on behalf of Barack Obama. February 5th state WFO launches and organizing events will include: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Minnesota and New Jersey.
