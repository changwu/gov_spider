    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of North Dakota State Auditor Bob Peterson, who will serve as a campaign's state Co-Chair. Peterson will work closely with Rudy's State Chairman and North Dakota Public Service Commissioner Kevin Cramer to grow the Mayor's support in the state.
"Rudy Giuliani used conservative principles to cut taxes 23 times in New York and restored fiscal discipline to city government. He has the executive skills and the record of turning a deficit into a surplus that this country needs in a President," said Peterson. "Rudy is the strongest Republican candidate to defeat the Democrats in 2008."
"We are so pleased with the support and organization we have in North Dakota. Rudy's message of strong leadership and his 12 Commitments to the American People are clearly resonating throughout the state," said Giuliani's National Political Director Mark Campbell. "We are glad to have Bob Peterson helping grow Rudy's team."
Peterson's announcement follows the recent endorsements of Cramer, Bismarck Mayor John Warford and State Public Service Commissioner Susan Wefald.
