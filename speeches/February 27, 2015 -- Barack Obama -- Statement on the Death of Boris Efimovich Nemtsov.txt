    The United States condemns the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov. And we call upon the Russian Government to conduct a prompt, impartial, and transparent investigation into the circumstances of his murder and ensure that those responsible for this vicious killing are brought to justice. Nemtsov was a tireless advocate for his country, seeking for his fellow Russian citizens the rights to which all people are entitled. I admired Nemtsov's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in Russia and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in Moscow in 2009.
We offer our sincere condolences to Boris Efimovich's family and to the Russian people, who have lost one of the most dedicated and eloquent defenders of their rights.
