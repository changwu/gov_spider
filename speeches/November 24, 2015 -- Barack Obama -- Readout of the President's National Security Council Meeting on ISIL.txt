    President Obama today convened his National Security Council to discuss the response to recent terrorist attacks by ISIL. The President was briefed that there is currently no specific, credible threat to the homeland from ISIL. The President was also briefed on ways we can enhance our existing security and intelligence cooperation with partners, building on recent discussions at the G20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey. The President directed his national security team to continue to intensify ongoing efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL, including working with our partners to increase our military cooperation in the counter-ISIL campaign, disrupting foreign fighter networks, halting ISIL expansion outside of Syria and Iraq, and disrupting any ISIL external plotting efforts. The President emphasized that degrading and destroying ISIL will continue to require coordination and cooperation among a wide range of global partners, and the United States is strongly committed to continuing to lead the shared efforts of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.
