    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal – a once-in-a-generation investment that will create millions of jobs, modernize our infrastructure, and tackle the climate crisis – passed the House and now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.
For far too long, Washington policymakers have celebrated "infrastructure week" without ever following through. The American people made it clear: we need to deliver. The President and Congressional Democrats proved we can.
Latino leaders praised the President and the lawmakers who worked across the aisle to pass the historic legislation, which will make a real impact in communities across the country, and put us on a path to win the economic competition for the 21st century.

Organizations
The Hispanic Federation: "We applaud Congress & @POTUS on passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. The critical investment it will make in our communities will create millions of jobs that will put Latinos, and all Americans, on a path to be competitive in the 21st century." [Tweet, 11/6/21]
Hispanic Technology & Telecommunications Partnership: "Access to high quality, dependable and affordable broadband is a critical tool for the success of the Latino community nationwide. Today only 65% of Latino households are able to afford the cost of having broadband service at home. The IIJA represents an important congressional investment in closing the digital divide and addresses the compounding barriers faced by historically under-connected communities: access, affordability and adoption." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Green Latinos: "With the House passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and the House procedural vote to advance the Build Back Better Act, we are on our way to helping millions of Latino families and all Americans on their path to recovery. Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and the Build Back Better Act will invest directly into our communities, improving the lives of millions, and invest in working and middle-class families across the country…" [Statement, 11/6/21]
Latino Victory Project: "This is a resounding win for the Latino community and for millions of working families across the country. The bill includes provisions that will bring much-needed benefits to the Latino community by creating more jobs, expanding access to high-speed internet, and improving public transportation. It will strengthen our economy by creating millions of good-paying jobs, and it will keep lowering the unemployment rate by putting more Americans back to work. The bill is a testament to President Biden and the Democrats' resolve to govern and work hard to deliver results for the American people. Now that the House advanced the rule for the Build Back Better Act, we urge members of Congress to pass the bill swiftly to help working families. It's time to deliver for the American people." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Voto Latino: "The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill is a massive achievement of a long overdue investment in America's aging roads and bridges, cleaner water systems, expanded broadband access, green energy solutions, and so much more. It's a sign the Democratic-controlled Congress can deliver for working families, combat climate change, create millions of good-paying jobs, and rebuild our communities for the benefit of future generations…" [Statement, 11/6/21]
Mi Familia Vota: "The investments are unprecedented, we will boost economic growth and create millions of good-paying jobs, bring supply chains back to the U.S. This bill will deliver the largest-ever federal investments in public transit and clean drinking water, in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, in bridges since the construction of the highway system, and the creation of universal internet access for American households. It will create jobs by fixing roads and bridges, replacing dangerous lead pipes to ensure our kids have clean drinking water, modernizing our electric grid, and making the largest investment in electric vehicle infrastructure in American history. Level the playing field and create economic opportunity for working people and communities of color by addressing economic disparities and rectifying decades of disinvestment." [Statement, 11/6/21]
The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement: "LCLAA celebrates the House's passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and looks forward to President Biden signing this bill into law. Through its $1 trillion investment in various areas of our infrastructure, the bill will create 1.5 million well-paying, non-outsourceable jobs per year if combined with the Build Back Better legislation making its way through congress—many of which will be union jobs and are sure to benefit working Latinos and bring thousands out of poverty and into a stable situation." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Corazon Latino: "Last night, we experienced a watershed moment that will reverberate for generations to come. Corazón Latino is proud of the House of Representatives for passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which contains spending plans that are critical for our families, our economic prospects, and our Madre Tierra. The investments made through this plan will secure the well-being of our nation starting with tangible gains at the household level and progressing to the jobs, green opportunities, and infrastructure that we need to fulfil our visions for a new tomorrow. We expect Congress to use the momentum of this achievement to immediately work to pass the Build Back Better plan; we must aim for our highest collective endeavor yet." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Latino Forward: "For decades, the American people have experienced the real costs of automotive repairs due to crumbling roads. We have seen video of numerous bridges collapsing and experienced substantial portions of our national power grid fail, both costing American lives. Today we are seeing price increases due to a struggling supply chain forced to use aging ports, rails, and roads, limiting the flow of both imports and exports, hurting our nation's economy. This is why Forward Latino applauds President Joe Biden's successful efforts that have brought together both Republicans and Democrats to pass the "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act." This important legislation will make a once in a generation investment in our nation's hard infrastructure without adding to the federal deficit. It provides funding to upgrade our bridges, ports, rails, and roads, will fund the replacement lead pipes in homes, and will provide affordable broadband access for all. It will upgrade and harden our nation's electrical grid while making a significant investment in fighting climate change by funding a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations. The "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act" will also create or sustain hundreds of thousands of good jobs paying a family-supporting wage." [Statement, 11/6/21]
