    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by the Flooding of the Mississippi River and Its Tributaries
I am saddened by the devastating losses caused by the flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries and the impact on the well-being and livelihood of our fellow Americans. Many parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster and to begin a massive effort to recover from the ravages of this flooding.
As part of this effort, I request heads of executive departments and agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the areas designated as disaster areas because of the flooding to use their discretion to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is faced with a personal emergency because of the flooding and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State or local officials having jurisdiction.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
