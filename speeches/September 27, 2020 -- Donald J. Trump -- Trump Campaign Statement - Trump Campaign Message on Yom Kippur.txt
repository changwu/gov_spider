    To honor Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish faith, Michael Glassner, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor, issued the following statement:
"As we reflect on the Day of Atonement, Team Trump offers our blessings to our Jewish friends in America and across the world. As we face these unprecedented times, we find renewed strength and hope through our faith. Under President Trump's stalwart commitment to the Jewish community and unparalleled defense of our religious liberties, we are able to pray and reflect in search for atonement and repentance to show our thanks for our many blessings. We continue to pray for peace and prosperity for all the days to come and are keeping our Jewish brothers and sisters in mind on the Highest of Holy Days."
