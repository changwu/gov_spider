    The Clinton campaign issued the following statement from Deputy Communications Director Phil Singer in response to the Obama campaign's failure to address the key question raised by a new report out today regarding its leadership PAC:
"The Obama campaign's failure to deny that it committed campaign finance violations speaks volumes. Instead of launching irrelevant attacks, Senator Obama should answer a simple question: Did Obama campaign officials direct the Hopefund to make contributions to officials and entities in states holding nominating contests? If the answer is no, they should just be direct and say so."
