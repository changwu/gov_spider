    Delaware House Republican Leader Greg Lavelle made the following statement on Delaware's upcoming primary:
"With businesses closing and gas prices on the rise, the American dream seems to be slipping away for many Delaware families. We need new leadership in Washington that will restore America's promise. After Mitt Romney's strong victories last night, it has become even clearer that he is, by far, the strongest candidate to defeat Barack Obama. He has a bold vision that is dedicated to reversing the failed policies of the last three years that includes repealing Obamacare, lowering taxes, and scaling back the size of government. Throughout his life, Mitt has proved to be a true problem solver. He knows how crucial the right business climate is to spur economic growth. I stand with Mitt because he has the proven experience and the bold plan to turn our country around."
