    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dingell (D) Michigan and one other)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2600, because the bill would (1) authorize excessive appropriations for the Securities and Exchange Commission for 1988 (6.1 percent more than the President's Budget request) and (2) impose rigid and unnecessary management constraints on the SEC in connection with the development and operation of the EDGAR system.
