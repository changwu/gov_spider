    Gov. Ruth Ann Minner to Chair Clinton's Delaware Campaign
The Clinton Campaign today released its Delaware Steering Committee, made up of elected officials and community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Delaware's February 5th primary. The Campaign has placed regional coordinators throughout the state, who will be responsible for organizing volunteers, planning activities, and reaching out to undecided voters in their regions of the state.
The Campaign also announced that Governor Ruth Ann Minner will serve as Co-Chair of Hillary's Delaware Campaign. Capitalizing on the momentum from Saturday's victory in the Nevada Caucus, the campaign is ready to compete and campaign aggressively for every vote in Delaware.
"I am proud to serve as Chair of Hillary's Delaware Campaign," said Governor Minner. "During these challenging times, we need a President who will walk into the White House on day one and immediately tackle the tough issues facing our country. Hillary is the only candidate in this race who has a real plan for jumpstarting our economy, a real plan for creating jobs and keeping those jobs at home where they belong, and a real plan for ensuring that every single American has access to health care. She's the kind of leader Delaware families need to move us forward."
