    MANCHESTER, NH -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the McCain 2008 Maine leadership team. These statewide and county leaders, representing all sixteen Maine counties, will work to bolster John McCain's support within Maine. John McCain arrives in the state today and will campaign in South Portland on Monday at the Maine Military Museum.
"John McCain's record of putting his country ahead of partisan politics makes him a perfect fit for Maine's discerning voters," said former Governor John R. McKernan, Jr., who serves as Honorary State Chair and is also a former First District Congressman. "McCain shares the priorities of most Mainers. He has plans to lead America to energy independence, create new jobs and expand access to affordable health care. In the months leading up to the election, our Maine leadership team will work on a person-to-person basis to spread John McCain's message of reforming government and building a more peaceful and prosperous America."
In addition to Honorary State Chair McKernan, Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins will serve as State Co-Chairs. House Republican Leader Rep. Josh Tardy (R-Newport) will serve as Maine State Vice Chair. First Congressional District Co-Chairs are former congressman David Emery and longtime Republican activist Jan Staples.
