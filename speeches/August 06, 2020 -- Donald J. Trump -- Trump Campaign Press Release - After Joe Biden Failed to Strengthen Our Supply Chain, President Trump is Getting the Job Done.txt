    Biden sold out American workers for decades. 
Americans finally have a President that stands up for American workers. President Trump's Executive Order today will help bring supply chains back to the United States and ensure we're producing essential medications in America rather than relying on foreign suppliers. This is a win for American workers and consumers.
President Trump has worked to restore U.S. supply chains since his first day in office. He signed an executive order in the opening months of his presidency to "assess and strengthen the manufacturing defense industrial base and supply chain resiliency of the United States," and last year President Trump publicly encouraged U.S. companies to move their production capabilities out of China and back to the United States. Due to President Trump's tough negotiations, many have already done it. President Trump's commitment to his America First agenda has already resulted in American companies bringing nearly $1 trillion back to the United States, and the Trump Administration has only turbocharged their efforts in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Joe Biden doesn't know anything about putting American workers first. His failed, old, liberal ideas will undo President Trump's progress and ship jobs and supply chains overseas, just as he did for decades. His globalist agenda helped China bleed America's production capacity dry. As a result of NAFTA and China's "most favored nation" trade status, both supported by Biden, 60,000 American factories closed and one in four manufacturing jobs were lost.
President Trump kept his promise to put America first. Hardworking Americans won't let Joe Biden betray them again.
