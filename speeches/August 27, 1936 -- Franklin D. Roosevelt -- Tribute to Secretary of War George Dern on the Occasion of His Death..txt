    An upright, able and honest public servant is lost to our national life in the death of Secretary Dern. Quiet and unassuming, he mastered with singular thoroughness all of the varied problems which fall within the jurisdiction of the War Department and administered his office with tact, discretion and good judgment. The Army of the United States has lost a devoted leader.
For many years George Dern and I have been close associates, first as Governors of our respective States, and lately, for nearly four years, in Washington. I am deeply grieved that he has left us.
