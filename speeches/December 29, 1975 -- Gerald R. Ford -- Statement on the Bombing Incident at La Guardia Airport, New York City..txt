    I AM deeply grieved by the loss of life and injuries which occurred tonight at La Guardia Airport in New York. It appears this senseless act involved the use of a bomb.
I have instructed Secretary of Transportation William Coleman and the FAA to investigate immediately and to give me a complete report on the tragedy as soon as possible. The Justice Department and the FBI have been directed to provide whatever assistance they can to the FAA and local law enforcement agencies.
