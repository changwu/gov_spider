    I applaud the Teamsters and UPS for coming together, negotiating in good faith, and reaching a tentative agreement today that will avoid a shutdown at UPS. While this agreement still awaits final ratification by Teamsters members, today's announcement moves us closer to a better deal for workers that will also add to our economic momentum. I've always said that collective bargaining works by providing workers a seat at the table and the opportunity to improve their lives while contributing fully to their employer's success. This agreement is a testament to the power of employers and employees coming together to work out their differences at the bargaining table in a manner that helps businesses succeed while helping workers secure pay and benefits they can raise a family on and retire with dignity and respect.
