    On behalf of the American people, Laura and I send our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in the devastating earthquake in Indonesia. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Indonesian people as they comfort all those affected by this terrible disaster.
Through financial and material support, the United States is assisting with recovery efforts in coordination with Indonesian authorities, and we stand prepared to provide additional assistance as needed.
