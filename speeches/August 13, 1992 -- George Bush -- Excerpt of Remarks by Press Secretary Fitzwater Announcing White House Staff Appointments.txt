    I'd like to announce several additions to the White House staff. Margaret Tutwiler will return as Assistant to the President for Communications. Robert Zoellick will become Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff. Dennis Ross will become Assistant to the President for Policy Planning. Janet Mullins will become Assistant to the President for Political Affairs.
All of these Presidential appointments will become effective on August 23, 1992. In addition, Steve Provost, who is currently on the staff, will become Assistant to the President and chief speechwriter.
