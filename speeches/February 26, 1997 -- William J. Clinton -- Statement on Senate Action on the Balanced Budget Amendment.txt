    I have made clear my concerns about the balanced budget amendment, and I am pleased that Senator Torricelli has made the difficult decision to oppose that measure.
Now it's time to get down to the hard work of balancing the budget. I look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to enact a plan that balances the budget in 5 years while protecting education and other critical investments in America's future.
