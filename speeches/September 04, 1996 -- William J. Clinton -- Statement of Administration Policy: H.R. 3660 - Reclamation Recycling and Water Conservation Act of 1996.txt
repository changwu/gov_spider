(House)(Hansen (R) UT)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3660, but would support an authorization of a limited program of demonstration projects to further test the water reuse concept. H.R. 3660 is objectionable because it would authorize 18 specific projects in Western States without a process for determining whether these particular projects warrant a Federal role and without objective criteria for establishing Federal priorities among them. The Administration would like to work with the Congress to design a program that addresses these concerns and provides further examples of how water reuse technology can help urban communities meet their local water supply needs and environmental protection objectives.
