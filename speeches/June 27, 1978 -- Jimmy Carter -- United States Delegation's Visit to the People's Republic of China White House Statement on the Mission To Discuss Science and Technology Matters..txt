    Dr. Frank Press, the adviser on science and technology to the President and the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will lead a 14-member delegation of U.S. Government science policy makers and administrators to China from July 6-10.
Dr. Press is undertaking this mission at the request of the President. The trip was first discussed with the Chinese during Dr. Brzezinski's May 20-23 trip to Peking.
While in the People's Republic, the delegation will be hosted by Peking's pertinent science and technology organizations.
Dr. Press and his group will be in Peking for 4 days of discussions with Chinese counterparts.
Dr. Press's visit is in keeping with the Shanghai Communiqu√© of February 1972, in which the United States and the People's Republic agreed that "It is desirable to broaden the understanding between the two peoples . . . in such fields as science and technology." Both sides undertook to facilitate the further development of such contacts and exchanges. It is our hope that Dr. Press's delegation will lead to a broader program with China in science and technology.
