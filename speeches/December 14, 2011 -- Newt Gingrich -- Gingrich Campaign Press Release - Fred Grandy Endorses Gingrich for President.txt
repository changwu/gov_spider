    Atlanta, GA - Former Iowa Congressman Fred Grandy today announced his endorsement of Newt Gingrich for President of the United States.
"I am proud to support Newt's campaign for president," Grandy said today. "I believe that his optimistic, solutions-oriented message is resonating well with the people of Iowa and with all Americans.
"As someone who worked with Newt while in Congress, I also am saddened to see some of his former colleagues attack his leadership style.  Newt's leadership is the major reason Republicans won control of Congress in 1994 and enjoy a majority today.  I believe that Newt is the best candidate to unite our party as we seek to unseat Barack Obama next year."
Grandy, whose hometown is Sioux City, Iowa, will attend Thursday's Republican debate as a leading Gingrich surrogate.
