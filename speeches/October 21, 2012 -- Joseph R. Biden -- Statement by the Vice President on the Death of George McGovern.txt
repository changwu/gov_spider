    Jill and I are profoundly saddened to hear about George McGovern's passing. I was honored to serve with him, to know him, and to call him a friend.
George believed deeply in public service. It defined him as a Senator and as a man. And he never stopped serving for his entire life â€“ whether it was his courage in World War II, his time in Congress, or his fight to eliminate hunger at home and abroad.
Above all, George McGovern was a generous, kind, honorable man. He will be missed, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family today.
