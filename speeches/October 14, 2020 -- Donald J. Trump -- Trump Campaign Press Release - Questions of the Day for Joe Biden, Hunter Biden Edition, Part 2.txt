    Why did you lie to the American people when you said you never discussed your son Hunter's foreign business schemes, including those involving the Ukrainian energy company Burisma?
According to emails obtained by the New York Post, you met with Hunter and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma adviser, in Washington, DC in 2015. What did you discuss?
In those emails, Hunter was asked to "influence" issues affecting Burisma. What did Hunter ask you to do, and what "influence" did you exert?
Why, then, less than a year later, did you pressure Ukrainian officials to fire the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma?
