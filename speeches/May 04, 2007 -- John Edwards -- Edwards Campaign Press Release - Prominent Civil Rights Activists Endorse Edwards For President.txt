    New Orleans, Louisiana â€“ During his visit to New Orleans and Baton Rouge today, Senator John Edwards received the support of three prominent civil rights activists. Actor Danny Glover, Louisiana civil rights activist Kwame Asante and Mississippi civil rights activist Derrick Johnson all endorsed Edwards for president.
Glover and Asante joined Edwards today in New Orleans, where they worked on a damaged house in the 9th Ward and then visited Orelia Tyler, whose home Edwards worked on during his presidential announcement. Today, Edwards is also speaking at the National Conference of Black Mayor' 33rd Annual Convention in Baton Rouge, where he will discuss how we can help New Orleans recover and how we can work to end inequality in our country.
Glover endorsed Edwards saying, "John Edwards brings everyone to the table. His words, actions, and policies speak to all of us. He brings integrity, honesty, and a spirit of activism that challenges each of us to do more to make this a better nation and a better world. I know him, I trust him, and I know he will be a great president."
Asante said, "There is no greater a need or more important a time for our country to have a president that responds to the call of the people. Senator John Edwards' attendance at the National Conference of Black Mayors Convention in Louisiana is an example of his desire to answer that call. I support John Edwards by joining him on Friday in the 9th Ward of New Orleans to continue the work of rebuilding homes in New Orleans."
Johnson said, "John Edwards brings a level of integrity that this country needs and deserves."
