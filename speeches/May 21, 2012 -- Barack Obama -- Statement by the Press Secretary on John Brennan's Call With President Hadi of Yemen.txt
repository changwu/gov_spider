    Today, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan called Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi to convey President Obama's deep condolences for the cowardly terrorist attack in Sana'a that brutally killed and injured more than 100 Yemeni soldiers. Mr. Brennan strongly condemned the despicable violence that struck as Yemen's military forces were preparing to celebrate their country's unity on Yemen's National Day. Mr. Brennan offered U.S. assistance on the investigation into this tragic incident and said that the United States would stand by Yemen's side at this difficult time. President Hadi thanked the United States for its support and vowed to continue his nation's fight against al-Qa'ida so that the Yemeni people can live in a secure, stable, and prosperous environment that is free of terrorist violence. Mr. Brennan and President Hadi reaffirmed the unshakable partnership between Yemen and the United States, and President Hadi pledged not to let terrorist acts interfere with Yemen's peaceful political transition.
