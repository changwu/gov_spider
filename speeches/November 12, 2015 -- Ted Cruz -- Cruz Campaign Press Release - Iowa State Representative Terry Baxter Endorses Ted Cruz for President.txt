    HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today welcomed the endorsement of Iowa State Representative Terry Baxter, a first term lawmaker from Garner.
Affiliated with the Evangelical Free Church, Rep. Baxter is the only ordained minister currently serving in the Iowa Legislature. He is the co-founder and Executive Director of Global Compassion Network, an organization that provides aid, domestically and internationally, to disaster-stricken areas.
"Terry and his wife Debby are wonderful examples of selfless public servants, and I am honored to have their friendship and support," Sen. Cruz said. "Terry's leadership is reminiscent of the Colonial era pastors who made up the 'Black Robe Regiment' that was so influential in shaping this nation. Like those early patriot pastors, Rep. Baxter understands the need for people of faith to participate as we work together to reignite the promise of America."
"I spoke to several campaigns following Gov. Walker's departure from the race, and ultimately settled on Cruz because I believe he is uniquely qualified to lead the country," said Rep. Baxter. "We need a strong leader who can clearly communicate a conservative message to a nation that desperately needs to be reminded of our founding principles. Ted Cruz has proven that he is unafraid to lead the fight on issue after issue, all the while reminding us of what made this country great, and urging us to once again be proud to be Americans."
In addition to joining the campaign's Statewide Leadership Team, Rep. Baxter will also help lead the "99 Iowa Pastors" coalition in the build up to the February 1st Caucus.
