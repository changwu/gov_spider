    With the signing of the Great American Outdoors Act, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to increasing access to the natural beauty of America's public lands. As Joe Biden attacks gun-owners, hunters, and other sportsmen, the Trump Administration is fostering a new generation of outdoorsmen to preserve and protect our country's natural landscape for years to come. Michael Waddell, host of Bone Collector TV, and Willie Robertson, CEO of Duck and Buck Commander, discussed all this and more on tonight's 'Team Trump Online! Triggered' hosted by Donald Trump Jr.

"President Trump has cemented his place in American history as one of the most impactful conservationists with the passage of the Great American Outdoors Act. This legislation will restore our country's public lands and preserve our natural heritage for generations to come," said Donald Trump Jr. "As Joe Biden and the radical left work to 'cancel' American hunters and fishermen, President Trump will always stand up for Americans' access to natural land and the way of life for millions of outdoorsmen and women across the nation."
"President Trump understands the importance of maintaining America's culture of self-sufficiency, which is rooted in our access to the great outdoors," said Michael Waddell, host of Bone Collector TV. "To preserve our shared American heritage as hunters and fishermen, we have to re-elect President Trump in November."
"I have known the Trump family for years and I am confident President Trump is firmly committed to keeping America's great outdoors open to people of all backgrounds and incomes," said Willie Robertson, CEO of Duck and Buck Commander. "It is vital that we re-elect President Trump to continue the restoration of our nation's lands and to guarantee hunters and fishermen have the access to nature they deserve."
