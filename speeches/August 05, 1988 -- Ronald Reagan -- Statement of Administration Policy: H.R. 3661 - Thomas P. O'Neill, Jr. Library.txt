    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conte (R) Massachusetts)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3661, which would require the Department of.Education to absorb the cost of over $14 million plus interest on an outstanding Federal facilities construction loan made to Boston College in 1981 to establish the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. .Library. It is inappropriate to single out this institution for such special treatment when other academic institutions are required to repay over 1,100 similar facilities construction loans amounting to over $827 million owed to the Department of Education.
