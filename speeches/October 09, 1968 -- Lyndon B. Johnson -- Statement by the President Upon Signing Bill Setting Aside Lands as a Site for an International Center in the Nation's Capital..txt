    TODAY we make the Federal City a more gracious and responsive host to our official guests from other lands.
In recent years, we have been faced with the problem of finding suitable sites for the growing number of embassies, chanceries, and international organizations. Many of the world's newer nations need room for their diplomatic staffs. Many of the older nations require larger quarters. Yet, the shortage of space has become more and more acute.
We set out to cope with this problem. Committees were formed. Agendas were prepared. Local groups were consulted.
Out of this process came a plan, and a practical solution to a perplexing problem.
The bill I sign today is the culmination of that effort. It sets aside surplus land at the old National Bureau of Standards site for a new international complex. In time, we will see this 34-acre site transformed into a distinctive and diverse international center which can be the pride of the Nation's Capital.
Under this new law, the center can be built without relocating or displacing a single District resident, and without any cost to the American taxpayer. Its use is in accord with the long range plan for the District of Columbia.
H.R. 1675 received the unanimous approval of both Houses of the Congress. It is a forward step in the conduct of our foreign relations and in the development of our Nation's Capital. I am pleased to sign it into law.
