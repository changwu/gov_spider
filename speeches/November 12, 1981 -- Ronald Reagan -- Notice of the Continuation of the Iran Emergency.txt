    On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order No. 12170, President Carter declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. Notice of the continuation of the national emergency beyond November 14, 1980 was transmitted by President Carter to the Congress and published in the Federal Register on November 12, 1980. Because our relations with Iran have not yet been normalized and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981 agreements with Iran is still under way, the national emergency declared November 14, 1979 must continue in effect beyond November 14, 1981. Therefore, pursuant to section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am signing this notice of the continuation of the national emergency declared November 14, 1979, and causing such notice to be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
