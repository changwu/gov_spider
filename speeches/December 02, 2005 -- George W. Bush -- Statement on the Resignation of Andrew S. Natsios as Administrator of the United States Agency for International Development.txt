    Andrew Natsios has served as a key member of my administration for more than 4 years. He has exemplified the compassion and generosity of the American people and our deep commitment to helping and improving the lives of those who are suffering. Under his leadership, USAID has implemented important reforms and helped us combat AIDS and malaria, rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq, provide humanitarian aid in Sudan, and assist victims of the tsunami and the recent devastating earthquake in South Asia. I thank him for his dedicated service to our country, and I wish him and his family well.
