The two Presidents discussed a range of issues, including efforts to stem insider attacks on U.S., coalition, and Afghan forces; the importance of continuing to encourage restraint and non-violence in reaction to inflammatory materials; and continued implementation of the U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership Agreement. The President expressed his condolences and remembrances on the eve of the one-year anniversary of former Afghan President Rabbani's assassination, and the two leaders agreed to continue our work together in support of an Afghan-led reconciliation process. The President reiterated his strong support for Afghan sovereignty, and the two leaders agreed to take additional concrete steps to implement the Strategic Partnership Agreement, including launching the U.S.-Afghan Bilateral Commission in coming weeks and beginning negotiations on a Bilateral Security Agreement.
