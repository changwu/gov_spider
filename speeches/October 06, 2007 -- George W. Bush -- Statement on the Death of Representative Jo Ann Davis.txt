    Laura and I are deeply saddened that Representative Jo Ann Davis lost her courageous battle with breast cancer today. Her determination to fight the disease is an inspiration to all of us.
Over the course of her four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, she was an effective advocate for the people of her district and a strong supporter of our men and women in uniform. She was a fine example of a public servant who worked hard to cut Government waste to ensure the people's money was used wisely. Her commonsense values will be missed on Capitol Hill.
Laura and I send our thoughts and prayers to her husband Chuck, their two sons, and the rest of the Davis family during this difficult time.
