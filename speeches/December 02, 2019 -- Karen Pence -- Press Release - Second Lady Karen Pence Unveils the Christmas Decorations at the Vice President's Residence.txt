    Enthusiasm for the Christmas Season fills the air at the Vice President's Residence. Today, Second Lady Karen Pence revealed the 2019 Christmas decorations and theme "Victorian Christmas" which highlights the historic Victorian-era Residence. Built in 1893 for the Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Queen Anne-style house was designed by Washington, D.C. architect Leon Dessez and was the grandest of all the homes built on the grounds. This year's theme reflects the rich history of the Residence and presents an appreciation for the living piece of history.
Devers Design, in Arlington, Virginia assisted in the design and installation of the decorations. With the help of more than 40 volunteers, together they filled 300 feet of indoor garland with fresh holly; crafted Victorian ornaments from paper cones filled with dried baby's breath and gold ribbons; strung yards of fresh cranberries; created three wreath chandeliers in the entrance marquee; and hung hundreds of ornaments and white and gold beads.
At the front gate of the Residence, 2,100 feet of garland and 160 velvet bows line the fence encircling the Residence property. In the front lawn, a 16.5 foot Frasier Fir is adorned with multi-colored lights and Christmas ornaments designed by children from Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition to the Frasier Fir in front of the Residence, throughout the historic home there are 7 Christmas trees all provided by Wyckoff's Christmas Tree Farm of Belvidere, New Jersey. The Wyckoff's Christmas Tree Farm was named the Reserve Grand National grower in 2019.
During this Christmas season, the Pence family will welcome over 3,000 guests into the Vice President's Residence over the Holiday Season. The photos below provide a look at Christmas 2019 inside the Vice President's Residence.
