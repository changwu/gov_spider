    The measures proposed today by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce harmful emissions from trucks and buses represent another major milestone in this administration's long-standing effort to ensure cleaner, healthier air for all Americans.
Air pollution has declined dramatically over the past quarter century, but stronger action is needed to protect public health and keep us on track to meeting our Nation's air quality goals. That is why last year I announced tough new tailpipe and fuel standards to dramatically reduce emissions from cars, SUV's, and other light-duty trucks. Today's proposal would establish stringent new standards for heavy-duty trucks and buses and the diesel fuel that powers them. These proposed standards would produce the cleanest trucks and buses ever, significantly reducing smog, soot, and other pollutants that contribute to asthma and other respiratory disease.
Americans today enjoy the cleanest environment in a generation and the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. I am confident that today's proposal—which will be refined in the coming months with input from the public, industry, and the environmental community— will produce even greater benefits for both our economy and our environment.
