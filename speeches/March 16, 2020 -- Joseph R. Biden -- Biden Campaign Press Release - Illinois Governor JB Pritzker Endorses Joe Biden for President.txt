    Today, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"As our nation faces some of the biggest challenges of our time, I know Vice President Joe Biden is the right candidate to beat Donald Trump and lead us into a new era. It's time to unite as Democrats to restore respect to our nation's highest office. Joe will stand on the side of working families and serve as a partner to us in Illinois as we work to create good paying jobs, expand healthcare and invest in education. After four years of Donald Trump's failure to lead with honor, tell the truth, or stand up for the middle class, we need a steady hand and a President who is ready to move our nation past the divisiveness and vitriol that have become the norm in 2020. I trust Joe to lead with his head and heart, to do what's right, and to get things done for the American people."
Governor Pritzker joins a growing list of prominent Illinois leaders supporting Biden, including U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth; U.S. Representatives Bobby Rush, Sean Casten, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Brad Schneider, Danny Davis, Mike Quigley, Robin Kelly, and Bill Foster; Secretary of State Jesse White; Attorney General Kwame Raoul; former U.S. Senator and Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun; Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot; and state legislators, mayors, and community leaders from across Illinois.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
