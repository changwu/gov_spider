    Alexandria, VA — Today, Senator Lindsey Graham made the following statement in light of President Obama's decision to withdraw down to 5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan:
"As always, President Obama, through stubbornness and a general lack of appreciation for what is necessary to win a war, is putting our gains in Afghanistan in jeopardy by insisting on a withdrawal down to 5,500 U.S. troops. President Obama is implementing a policy that will require our men and women in uniform to accept an incredibly high risk, with little support, simply because he's the president who promised to end wars.
"President Obama does not follow sound military advice. He seems to have learned nothing from his past mistakes. As president, I will follow the advice of my commanders and require a conditions-based withdrawal — not an artificial timeline. I view a residual force in Afghanistan as protection against 9/11; President Obama views this force as a broken campaign promise."<
