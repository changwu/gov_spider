    Dear Hugh:
You have requested my views on an amendment offered by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia to the Cooper-Church amendment to the Foreign Military Sales bill now being considered by the Senate.
As you know, I am opposed to the language of the Cooper-Church provision in its present form. Nevertheless, I fully appreciate the concerns of many Senators anxious that the Cambodian expedition not involve our Nation in another Vietnam-type conflict. As I reported to the American people last night, this has been the most successful operation of this long and difficult war and will be completed by June 30. The results will be fewer casualties and continued withdrawals from Vietnam---objectives that Senators share with me.
The Byrd amendment reaffirms the Constitutional duty of the Commander in Chief to take actions necessary to protect the lives of United States forces and is consistent with the responsibilities of my office. Therefore, it goes a long way toward eliminating my more serious objections to the Cooper-Church amendment.
You will recall that last year in Guam I outlined the Nixon doctrine establishing a policy for Asian nations to defend themselves, with American material assistance and technical help. If a stable lasting peace is to emerge in that beleaguered region, it is important that we promote regional cooperation. Therefore, I should hope that the Senate would also adopt an amendment supporting the Nixon doctrine of American material and technical assistance toward self-help.
I appreciate your continued deep interest in this subject and the untiring effort you and your colleagues have made in an effort to achieve meaningful legislation in the best interest of the American people.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable Hugh Scott, The United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510]
