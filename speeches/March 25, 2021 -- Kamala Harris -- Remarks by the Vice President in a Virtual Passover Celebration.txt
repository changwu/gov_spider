    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Rabbi, and everyone. Everyone, it's -- yes, next year, in person, Mr. President, and, you know, in Jerusalem. But it's good to be with everyone. And I am so honored to be a part of this celebration and that we are all here together to celebrate Passover.
And I especially want to thank Rabbi Brous for all of your work, and the Milton Gottesman Jewish Day School of the Nation's Capital for all of the work that you have been doing to make this special gathering happen.
And I also want to take a moment to welcome several distinguished guests who are joining our Passover celebration this evening: my friend and former colleague -- but friend, always -- Jacky Rosen, a former Rabbi -- well, still a Rabbi; I want to thank all of the members of Congress who are a part of this; and everyone for all of the work that you have done.
And, of course, I'm so glad to see the Second Gentleman in his element. I only wish -- you know, he talked earlier about those matching Passover outfits. I just wish we had a photograph to really fully appreciate the magnificence of that. (Laughs.)
But our family, like so many families in the United States and the state of Israel and around the world, will begin to celebrate this sacred holiday of Passover this weekend.
The Passover story is powerful. It reminds us of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of injustice. It urges us to keep the faith in the face of uncertainty. And it speaks to fundamental truths -- the truths that we all hold dear and must sometimes be reminded of -- which is that we all deserve freedom and it's our duty to fight for those who are not yet free.
And so, this year, as we dip our greens in saltwater and pour out our ceremonial wine and eat our bitter herbs, let us commit, once again, to repairing the world.
Happy Passover to all who celebrate. And indeed, next year, in Jerusalem; next year, in person.
And now, I am thrilled to introduce the children of IKAR for a final word.
