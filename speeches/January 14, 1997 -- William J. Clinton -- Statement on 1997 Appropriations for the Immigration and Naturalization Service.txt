    For many years, the Immigration and Naturalization Service did not receive sufficient resources to carry out some of its vital functions. As a result, control of our borders suffered and illegal immigration flourished.
Four years ago, we began an effort to revitalize the INS by providing the resources and commitment to fulfill our responsibilities. During this period, INS funding has grown 105 percent. Our borders have been greatly strengthened with more personnel and better technology, workplace enforcement has gotten tougher, and a record number of criminal aliens have been deported.
Today's announcement represents continuing wise management of the additional resources requested by me and provided by the Congress. And it represents my administration's continuing commitment to an immigration policy that recognizes the value of legal immigration while strengthening our efforts to restrict illegal immigration.
