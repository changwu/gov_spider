    Sam and Mrs. Martinez and your family, Secretary Mathews, Secretary Hills, distinguished guests:
Let me welcome you to the White House today for the swearing in of Sam Martinez as Director of the Community Services Organization and Administration [Community Services Administration]. I spent a good deal of time in Sam Martinez' native State, and I feel the next best thing to visiting Colorado is bringing one of its leading citizens to Washington.
Sam Martinez brings to Washington more than a decade of experience in dealing with public policy at many, many levels. At a time when the American people are concerned about maintaining the roles of the State and local units of government, his experience at those levels makes him especially valuable to all of us.
Sam Martinez began his administrative career as a principal at Fort Lupton High School in Colorado where he had been a teacher as well as a coach. His involvement in helping people at the State and local level began in 1964 when he was named assistant director of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. He served the people of Colorado as a special assistant to the Governor and as a State and regional director of the Colorado Office of Economic Opportunity.
Since that time, Sam Martinez began his responsibility in managing Federal programs and that role has expanded significantly. In the last few years he has served very constructively as Chairman of the Mountain Plains Federal Regional Council and Regional Director of the United States Department of Labor.
Sam Martinez and I share a personal commitment to help the poor and disadvantaged Americans served by the Community Services Administration. Its programs demand strong and very effective and very imaginative leadership. I am fully confident, Sam, that you will provide that leadership.
And now I ask the Executive Clerk, John Ratchford, to please administer the oath. John.
