    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/11/91)(House)(Dellums (D) California and 4 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1720 because it would unfairly authorize special Federal funding for activities which should be supported by District taxpayers or by grants obtained through competition with other local jurisdictions.
The Administration would not object to an extension of deadlines for the submission or implementation of planning documents set forth in the Saint Elizabeth's Hospital and District of Columbia Mental Health Services Act so long as it is clear that such extensions impose no new responsibilities or financial commitments on the Federal Government.
The Administration would not oppose the bill if Section 2 were amended in the Senate to clarify that funds made available for improvements to facilities are from those appropriated in FY 1988, and that the bill authorizes no new funds for this purpose.
