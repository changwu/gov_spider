    I join Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern in welcoming today's statement by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams committing to exclusively democratic and peaceful means in the political process in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein joins its voice to the vast majority of Northern Ireland's people who are determined to see, in Mr. Adams' words, that "violence is a thing of the past, over, done with, and gone." This statement is an important contribution to building the trust and confidence necessary to make the Good Friday accord a reality.
I am looking forward to meeting personally with all the party leaders in Northern Ireland. I will urge them to work for full and speedy implementation of the Good Friday accordâ€” the best way to put an end to conflict and ensure peace in Northern Ireland.
