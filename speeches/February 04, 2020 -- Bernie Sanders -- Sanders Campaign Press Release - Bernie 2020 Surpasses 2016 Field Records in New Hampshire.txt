    At first event of the swing, Sanders breaks record for largest Bernie 2020 rally held in Granite State
MANCHESTER, N.H. – As Sen. Bernie Sanders returns to the Granite State today to campaign ahead of the first in the nation primary, the Bernie 2020 campaign in New Hampshire announced it had surpassed the 2016 record for doors knocked. Just this past Saturday, Bernie 2020 knocked more than a door a second, or 69 doors per minute.
Tonight, at Sen. Sanders' first Granite State rally since the Iowa Caucuses, 1,324 people turned out in Milford to hear the candidate speak – breaking the previous Bernie 2020 state record and coming in at one of the largest 2020 rallies in New Hampshire of any candidate in the race to date.
"With just a week until primary day, I am confident in the dedicated volunteers, supporters, and staff who are powering this campaign in the Granite State," said Shannon Jackson, Bernie 2020 New Hampshire State Director. "I wouldn't want to cross the finish line with any other team."
In the week leading up to the Iowa Caucuses, Bernie 2020 knocked more than 93,000 doors in New Hampshire, bringing the total number of doors knocked since the start of the campaign to over 471,000, well above the campaign's 2016 record.
The Bernie 2020 ground game in New Hampshire is led by a base of more than 14,000 volunteers and supporters, and many more who pitch in where they can. The Sanders campaign has 17 offices throughout the state, including the northernmost office of any Democratic campaign this cycle, and has welcomed a staff of more than 150.
Since the campaign launched, Sen. Sanders has spoken directly to well over 24,000 Granite Staters at more than 50 events across all 10 counties.
Sen. Sanders' growing coalition of support in New Hampshire includes the state's highest ranking Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Andru Volinsky, 22 State Representatives, more than 100 community leaders, and seven local and county elected officials, as well as APWU-NH representing 1,000 postal workers and SEA/SEIU Local 1984 representing 10,000 employees across the state.
Growing support for Bernie 2020 in New Hampshire continues to be reflected in the polls, including a new poll out this week that shows Sen. Sanders leading among likely Democratic primary voters.
The Sanders campaign has aired seven ads in New Hampshire produced entirely by Sanders' in-house team: "Strive," "Our Side," "Patients Before Profits," "Fights For Us," "Belongs To Us," "Social Security," and "For All."
