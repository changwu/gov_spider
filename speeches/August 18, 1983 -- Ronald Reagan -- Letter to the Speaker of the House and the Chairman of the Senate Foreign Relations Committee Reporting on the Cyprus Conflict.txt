    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am herewith submitting a report on progress made in the past sixty days toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Since my last report to you there has been little progress toward settlement. It has been a period of reevaluation by both sides and the intercommunal talks have not resumed.
On June 15 the United Nations Security Council renewed the mandate of the UN Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The report issued at that time by the Secretary General on UNFICYP's activities and on general Cypriot developments is attached.
On July 4 UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar met in Geneva with Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash. Two days later the Secretary General's Special Representative, Ambassador Gobbi, returned to Nicosia where he remained until August 10 attempting to reconvene the intercommunal talks.
Our position continues to be one of full support for the Secretary General and his Special Representative. We support their efforts to reconvene the intercommunal talks as the best vehicle for an eventual settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
