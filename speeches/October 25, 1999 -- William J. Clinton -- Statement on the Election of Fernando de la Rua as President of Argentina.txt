    On behalf of the people of the United States, I congratulate Fernando de la Rua on his victory in Argentina's Presidential election. The Argentine elections were a model of civic participation and a testament to the strength and vibrancy of Argentina's democracy.
I look forward to working with President-elect de la Rua and to deepening the partnership between our two nations.
