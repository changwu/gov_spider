    While Floridians, including our frontline health care workers, continue to struggle every day with the far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives, Donald Trump comes to Florida with no apparent intention of addressing these issues and instead is there to raise money for his campaign with his Mar-a-Lago crowd. Throughout this pandemic, Donald Trump has ignored the problem, blamed others, tried to shield the magnitude of the pandemic, rewarded his friends while American families are struggling, and actively tried to divide our country. This isn't the behavior of a leader.
As deaths continue to rise due to COVID-19, Donald Trump should be focused on sending critically needed supplies to American hospitals and frontline workers. Instead, he's trying to distract Floridians from his failures, while standing by his friends and continuing to express admiration for dictators like Nicolas Maduro and Vladimir Putin — even after Putin placed bounties on American soldiers. Floridians and their families deserve better — and they need better. As president, I will lead with the transparency, respect, and dignity that all Americans deserve.
