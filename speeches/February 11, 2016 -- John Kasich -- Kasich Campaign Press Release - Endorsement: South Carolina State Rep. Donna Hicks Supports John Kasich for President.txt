    Today South Carolina State Representative Donna Hicks announced she has joined Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign as a member of the Kasich for America Steering Committee.
Said Hicks, "From my work in the legislature and as a small-business owner, I know that experience is the number-one ingredient for making a strong and effective leader. John Kasich's impressive record as a budget-balancer in Congress and as twice-elected Governor of Ohio is more than enough to convince me that he has the experience and history of accomplishment we so sorely need in the White House."
With her endorsement of John Kasich's campaign, Hicks joins the ranks of fellow State Representatives Chip Limehouse, Jeffrey Bradley and Gary Clary; as well as State Senators Paul Campbell, Jr., Ray Cleary and Greg Gregory in supporting his candidacy.
A Boiling Springs resident and business owner, Hicks has twice been elected to the South Carolina House as representative from Spartanburg County.
Said Kasich, "As a long-time community leader in upstate South Carolina and respected voice in the state legislature, Donna Hicks is a key addition to our Kasich for America team. Our team in the Upstate is already strong, and today it grows even stronger. I'm thrilled to have her on my side as we take our message to South Carolina voters."
