    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, and State and Other International Programs; the Federal Communications Commission; and the Smithsonian Institution. Overall, the discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
This transmittal also contains FY 2007 Budget amendments for the legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests for the legislative branch are commonly transmitted without change.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
