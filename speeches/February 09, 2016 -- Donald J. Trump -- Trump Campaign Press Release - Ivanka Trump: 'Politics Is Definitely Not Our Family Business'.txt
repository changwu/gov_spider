Tuesday on the Hugh Hewitt Show, Ivanka Trump said, "Politics is definitely not our family business."
The daughter of presidential candidate Donald Trump, and Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions of the Trump Organization said, "We don't even particularly love the word [politics]."
Hewitt asked Trump was what kind of advice she has given her father during debates and she said, "I try not to give him advice, especially in a context like that. You just want somebody to be relaxed and to be themselves."
"And you know, that's really the advice I give him, to just be himself. So, but you know, it's an incredible thing, and the learning curve has been obviously a steep one."
"You know, we've never been in politics. Politics is definitely not our family business," Trump said. "We don't even particularly love the word. So just seeing what he's done in six months is remarkable."
