    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 1103(b)(2) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Public Law 100 - 418; 102 Stat. 1129), I transmit herewith a report that includes my request for the extension of fast track procedures for the consideration of implementing legislation with respect to trade agreements entered into after May 31, 1991, and before June 1, 1993, together with a description of the progress made to date in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations, the anticipated schedule for transmitting such agreements to the Congress, and a statement of the reasons supporting my request for an extension of fast track procedures.
The fast track mechanism has played a vital role in U.S. trade policy for many years. It strengthens the hand of our trade negotiations and preserves the important role of the Congress in the shaping of U.S. trade policy. The continued availability of the fast track procedures over the next 2 years will ensure that our negotiators can bring to the Congress for its consideration trade agreements that will truly enhance the ability of the United States to compete internationally.
At a time when world events have reconfirmed the importance of U.S. leadership in multilateral efforts, maintaining fast track is essential to our leadership in the global trading system.
My request reflects my strong desire to continue the partnership between the Congress and the executive branch that the fast track represents. This partnership is essential if we are successfully to meet the world's growing economic challenges into the next century.
