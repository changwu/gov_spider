    I commend Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission Deborah Majoras for their work on the Identity Theft Task Force report released today. The report is the culmination of many months of hard work by numerous Federal Agencies. Identity theft is a serious problem in America, and my administration is working to combat this crime and to assist its victims. I thank the Attorney General, the Chairman, and their staffs for taking on this difficult and important assignment.
