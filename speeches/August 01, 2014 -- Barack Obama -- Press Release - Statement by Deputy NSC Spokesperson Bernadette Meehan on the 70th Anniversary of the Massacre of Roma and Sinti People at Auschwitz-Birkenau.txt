    Seventy years ago, on August 2, 1944, Nazis massacred almost 3,000 Roma and Sinti men, women, and children at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We mark the anniversary of this atrocity as a day of remembrance for the hundreds of thousands of Roma and Sinti people murdered during the Holocaust, as well as a reminder of the hatred and prejudice too many Roma and Sinti people still endure as part of their daily lives. As we honor the memory of all those who perished and express our solidarity with all who survived, we also mark this day to renew our commitment to preventing such violence and to speaking out against the intolerance that enables it.
