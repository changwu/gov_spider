    Republican presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) is targeting the Chinese Communist Party over purchasing farmland in Iowa and touts his support of ethanol production in a new radio ad in the early voting state.
"Sen. Tim Scott is a conservative fighter for American farmers. Tim Scott supports the renewable fuel standard and believes E15 should be sold year-round," a narrator says in the one-minute ad released Monday.
"Scott is working to pass a new farm bill that will strengthen our food security and create economic growth in rural communities, and he's fighting to stop the Chinese Communist Party from buying up our farmland," the ad continues.
Scott in the radio spot vows that "as president, I'll support the production of ethanol and other homegrown biofuels."
"I will stop China from buying our farmland, and I will fight for fair trade to ensure our farmers have access to foreign markets. God bless Iowa and the bountiful harvest you provide to our nation each and every year," he adds.
