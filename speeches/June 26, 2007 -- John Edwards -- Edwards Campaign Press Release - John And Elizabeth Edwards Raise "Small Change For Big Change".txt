    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – As the end of the second fundraising quarter approaches, Senator John Edwards and Elizabeth Edwards will hold grassroots fundraisers across the country to raise money and connect with supporters. The fundraisers are part of the "Small Change for Big Change" series of fundraisers the campaign launched earlier this month. The Edwards campaign has been built on reaching out to all Americans—not just those who can give the maximum donation to the campaign, so it has organized grassroots fundraisers around the country for supporters who share Edwards' commitment to changing our country.
This week, the Edwardses will hold "Small Change for Big Change" fundraisers in Houston, Texas; Tampa, Florida and Lexington, Kentucky. The fundraisers have helped build momentum for the campaign, raising money and energizing supporters. Thousands of people have attended "Small Change for Big Change" events in San Jose, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Washington, D.C and New York, New York.
