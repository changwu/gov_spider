    Laura and I are saddened by the passing of Lloyd Cutler. Lloyd Cutler served our Nation with dedication and distinction throughout his extraordinary career, including as Counsel and adviser to President Carter and President Clinton, and most recently on the Commission on weapons of mass destruction. He was a devoted public servant who had a profound influence on the legal profession. Laura and I extendour deepest sympathy to his family.
