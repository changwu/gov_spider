    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. DeMint (R) South Carolina and 203 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1057, which would permanently extend the expanded tax relief for adoption enacted in 2001. Adoption is a wonderful way to build a family and to provide a loving, permanent home to a child in need. Making the tax relief for adoptions permanent will provide financial relief to families taking this important step.
The President has called on Congress to make provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief acts permanent to prevent tax increases from hitting America's families, small businesses, investors, farmers, and seniors. Tax relief has greatly helped the economy weather the storms of recent years and fueled the economic recovery underway today. Making tax relief permanent will lay the foundation for sustained economic growth and job creation over the long term and enable taxpayers to better plan for their future.
The Administration is pleased that the House is acting now to make tax relief for adoption permanent. The Administration urges quick action in Congress to reduce the financial burden of families undertaking adoption by making this important part of the President's tax relief plan permanent.
