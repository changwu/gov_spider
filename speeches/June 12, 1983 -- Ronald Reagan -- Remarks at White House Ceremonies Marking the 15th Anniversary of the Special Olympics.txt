    First of all, welcome to the White House. And to those of you from Chile, Greece, Japan, and Kenya: Welcome to the United States. I hope you all enjoyed seeing "Superman III," starring Christopher Reeve. And isn't it great to have Christopherâ€”Superman-as a coach? This looks like it might be so much fun, I wish I'd worn my track clothes. [Laughter]
I understand that in Special Olympics, your torch is called the Flame of Hope. And that's exactly what your athletes represent today. By training and competing in these events, you're realizing your hopes for a fuller, more productive life. And you're kindling in the rest of us the hope that through individual effort we can make this a more caring world. And, Eunice, we're grateful for all you've done to give these special young people new opportunities for special growth.
We're grateful to these athletes for letting us share in their joy today. Thank you again, and welcome.
