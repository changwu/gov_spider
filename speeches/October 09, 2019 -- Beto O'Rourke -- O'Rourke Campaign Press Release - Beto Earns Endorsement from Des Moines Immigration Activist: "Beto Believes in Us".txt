    DES MOINES, IA — As President Trump ramps up his extreme and cruel immigration-deterrence policies, Beto O'Rourke's Iowa campaign announced the endorsement of Isabel Conn, a Mexican-American immigrant rights activist in Des Moines. Conn has long fought to help immigrants thrive in Iowa, including running the group Dance Without Borders and advocating to make Des Moines a 'welcome city' for immigrants. The endorsement highlights Beto's long record as an immigration advocate and his commitment to both listening to and fighting for America's immigrant community.

"I would like to feel welcome and I believe that Beto could do that for us — could make people feel welcome, could make people feel safe. That's the most important thing," said Isabel Conn, an immigrant activist in Iowa. "Safety in our communities — [enacting] immigration reforms that work, that do not divide families — I feel like Beto could do that. They're not criminals. They're workers, they're mothers, they're teachers, they're doctors, they're professors — they bring so much to this country and I believe Beto believes in us too."
In May, Beto announced a comprehensive immigration plan that would create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people and make naturalization easier for nearly 9 million eligible immigrants; establish a first­-of-its-­kind community­-based visa; end the cruel policies of the Trump administration; and promote security in the Northern Triangle with a $5 billion investment in Central America through non-governmental organizations, community groups, congregations, public-private partnerships, and spurring financial support from international partners.
