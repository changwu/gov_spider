    Pawlenty for President launched the first Iowa television advertisement in the 2012 presidential campaign today. "Results Not Rhetoric" focuses on Gov. Pawlenty's strong record of results in Minnesota. During his two terms as governor, he used innovative and conservative leadership to cut spending, reform health care and improve schools.
"We've had three years of empty talk and rhetoric that is not working and some candidates seem hungry to offer a lot more," said Pawlenty for President Communications Director Ann Marie Hauser. "But the question voters will ultimately ask is 'who has actually done it?' When they do, they will find Governor Pawlenty's results — not rhetoric — for American families are second to no other candidate in this race."
