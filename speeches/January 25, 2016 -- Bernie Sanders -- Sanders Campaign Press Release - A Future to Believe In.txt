    DES MOINES, Iowa – Making a closing case before Iowa's caucuses, Bernie Sanders presents his vision of an economy and political system that works for all Americans, not just the 1 percent. "There are those who say we cannot defeat a corrupt political system and fix a rigged economy," Sanders says in the spot set to begin airing in the Hawkeye State on Tuesday.
"But I believe we need to lift our vision above the obstacles in place – and look to the American horizon," he continues. "To a nation where every child can not only dream of going to college – but attend one. Where quality health care will be a birthright of every citizen. Where a good job is not a wish but a reality. Where women receive equal pay and a living wage is paid to all. An America where after a lifetime of labor there is time for rest and grandchildren. A nation that defends our people and our values but no longer carries so much of that burden alone."
Sanders has released comprehensive policy proposals to confront the problems facing the nation. He has detailed plans to make public colleges and universities tuition free, expand health care to all Americans, put 13 million Americans to work in good-paying jobs rebuilding the country's crumbling roads and bridges, pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, expand social security and defeat the Islamic State while avoiding perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
"I know we can create that America if we listen to our hearts. And that journey begins here in Iowa," Sanders concludes.
