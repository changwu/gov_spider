    Today, new analysis from the Treasury Department found that the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans are evading $163 billion a year in taxes.
The New York Times summarizes: "The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans are the nation's most egregious tax evaders, failing to pay as much as $163 billion in owed taxes per year, according to a Treasury Department report released on Wednesday."
The story continues, "The Treasury Department estimates that its tax gap proposals could raise $700 billion over a decadeâ€¦"
And the New York Times concludes that the Biden administration's tax enforcement proposals will focus on the suber-wealthy, writing: "Tax compliance rates are high for low- and middle-income workers who have their taxes deducted automatically from their paychecks. The rich, however, are able to use accounting loopholes to shield their tax liabilities."
