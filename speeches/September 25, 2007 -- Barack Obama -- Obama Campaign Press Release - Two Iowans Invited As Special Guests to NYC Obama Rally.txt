    Des Moines, IA -- Obama supporters Erin Wagner of Iowa City and Tracey Stovall of Des Moines were selected by the campaign to travel to New York and attend a Manhattan rally headlined by Senator Obama. Last week, our campaign announced that two Iowans who participated in our new "4 More" program would be chosen to attend the rally. Specifically, Obama supporters were asked to recruit four fellow Iowans to join Barack Obama's grassroots movement to bring true change to Washington, D.C. After reaching out to friends, family, and neighbors, participants logged onto http://iowa.barackobama.com/4more to let us know who they'd signed up.
"I support Obama because I support hope and his vision for change," Tracey Stovall said. "I have attended several rallies here in Des Moines and Barack Obama strikes me as a man whose heart belongs to the people. He believes things must change and isn't afraid to challenge the status quo. I am trying to convince many in my community that it doesn't take that many people to influence change. You must simply become engaged."
"I support Barack Obama because I sincerely believe in his message of hope and change," Erin Wagner said. "Our country is divided, but Barack Obama is a candidate that can unite America again."
"The road to change begins in Iowa," Senator Obama said. "Through the hard work of everyday people like Erin and Tracey, we are building a truly grassroots campaign driven by people ready for a fundamental change in the way we do politics in Washington, D.C."
Iowa City native Erin Wagner canvassed her dorm at the University of Northern Iowa and recruited 13 new supporters in a single day. Tracey Stovall was born and raised in Des Moines and is an active participant in Women for Obama. The rally will take place on Thursday, September 27th in New York City's Washington Square Park.
