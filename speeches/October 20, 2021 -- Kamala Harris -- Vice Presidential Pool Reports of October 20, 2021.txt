VP Print Pool Report #4
Here's what happened before Vice President Harris left the event to go to Capitol Hill.
Harris started speaking at 11:40 a.m. Staff sat in the audience, including her spokeswoman Symone Sanders.
Secretary Walsh spoke after the vice president. He wished Harris a happy birthday. Ahuja spoke next. Both Walsh and Ahuja wore the bracelets that indicate they received a coronavirus test from the White House today.
An aide handed the vice president a note during the speeches.
Pool was ushered out at 11:56 a.m., shortly after the vice president unexpectedly left the room to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
That's a wrap on pool duties for today. Have a good afternoon.
