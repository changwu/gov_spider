    Edwards invites supporters to create a 30-second original ad, contest gives regular Americans the chance to have their voices heard
Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, the John Edwards for President campaign launched "My Vote, My Voice," offering supporters the chance to have their voice heard by creating an original ad for John Edwards. The campaign is challenging supporters to submit a 30-second ad describing why they support John Edwards for president on the campaign's website – www.JohnEdwards.com/myvote – anytime between Friday, December 28th and Wednesday, January 16th.
"For decades, big corporations and powerful interests have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and deployed hundreds of lobbyists to try and silence the voice of the American people and block change and progress," Edwards said. "The American people – the people on Main Street – need a voice in Washington, and this contest is a chance for everyone in America to have their voice heard. Together, we can stand up to the powerful special interests that have taken over our democracy and fight to build a better future for our children."
The campaign is requesting that each ad submission focuses on one of Edwards' key proposals to build a better America: guaranteeing universal health care, halting global warming, ending the war in Iraq, restoring America's moral leadership in the world, ending poverty in America or strengthening the middle class.
The winning entries will be chosen by a panel of judges including: Elizabeth Edwards, John Edwards for President campaign manager Congressman David Bonior, Elizabeth Edwards' brother and NYU Tisch Film School professor Jay Anania, actor and activist James Denton, bloggers Jane Hamsher and Christy Hardin Smith of FireDogLake, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Joe Wineke, and Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson.
On Friday, January 18th, the campaign will announce a grand prize winner, and the ad will go on the air in February 5th states in the days leading up to "Super Tuesday." The grand prize winner will also have the opportunity to meet John or Elizabeth Edwards.
