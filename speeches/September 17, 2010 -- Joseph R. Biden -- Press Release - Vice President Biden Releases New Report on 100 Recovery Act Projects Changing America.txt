    Spotlights Some of the Most Innovative and Effective Recovery Act Projects Nationwide
WASHINGTON DC – Vice President Joe Biden today released a new report, "100 Recovery Act Projects that are Changing America." The report highlights some of the most innovative and effective Recovery Act projects across the country that are not only putting people back to work now, but helping transform our economy for years to come. The report can be viewed in full HERE.
"With Recovery Act projects like these, we're starting to turn the page on a decade of failed economic policies and rebuild our economy on a new foundation that creates good middle class jobs for American families," said Vice President Biden. "And we're not engineering this transformation alone – Recovery Act projects like these are drawing billions in private capital off the sidelines to help recharge our economy."
From wind turbine production in Muncie, Indiana to construction of a new commerce route in Appalachian Ohio, about 3 million Americans are on the job nationwide on Recovery Act projects like the ones in the Vice President's report. Together, they are conducting cutting edge research, rebuilding our nation's roads and bridges, growing small businesses, re-opening and re-inventing factories – and changing the American economy to make us stronger and more competitive as a nation.
