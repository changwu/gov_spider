I'm proud to have Henry and his wife Peggy, join the team. The people of South Carolina are amazing and I continue to lead all state polls by wide, double digit margins."
Lt. Governor McMaster added, "I am delighted to support Donald Trump. He is a man of accomplishment and speaks the truth in words everyone can understand, instills confidence in the people about our country's bright future, and reflects and believes in the strength and determination necessary for success. These qualities - and his quiet compassion for those in need - are essential to "making America great again." Now is the time for Donald Trump."
