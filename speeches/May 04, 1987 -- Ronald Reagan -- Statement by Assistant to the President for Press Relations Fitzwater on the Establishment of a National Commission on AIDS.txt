    Today the President approved the establishment of a national commission on AIDS. He directed his domestic policy staff to work with the Departments and Agencies to develop a charter.
The commission will (1) review research done to date and identify future areas of research that would be needed, (2) assess the long-term impact on our health care systems, (3) recommend ways to protect Americans who do not have the disease, and (4) suggest comprehensive, practical responses by both the public and private sectors.
The commission will report to the President on a periodic basis.
