Editorial
The Washington Times: Thanks To Trump Administration, The United States Has A Coronavirus Plan Of Action By Bradley Blakeman and Christos Makridis. It is not whether a pandemic will visit us; it is when. And, with the spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) worldwide, is it now and are we prepared? The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) describes a pandemic as a "global disease outbreak," such that an influenza pandemic occurs when "a new flu virus emerges for which people have little or no immunity." One of the most socially and economically challenging components of an influenza is the possibility of contagion — when a virus spreads rapidly and easily from person to person, which can cause serious illness in a short period of time across a large landscape. The economic and social consequences of a pandemic are significant. The Council of Economic Advisers published a report in 2019 in anticipation of the possibility of such a catastrophe, finding that pandemics can cause between $413 billion to $3.79 trillion in economic damages in a year.
Washington Examiner: Democrats' Attempt To Politicize Coronavirus Will Fail By Rob Wasinger. What a difference a month makes. In January, President Trump made the bold and tough decision to suspend travel from China after reports began to reveal the severity of the coronavirus outbreak there. For his efforts, he faced a barrage of criticism from leading Democrats and their mouthpieces in the media who labeled the ban extreme, premature, and (of course) racist. While the administration was busy setting up a task force to assess and deal with the new risk, Democrats took time out from flogging their latest Russia conspiracy theory to criticize the lack of diversity in the experts Trump had chosen for the coronavirus group. Now, as the coronavirus outbreak spreads to countries that exercised less foresight in clamping down on travel and other preventative measures than did the United States, the Democratic apparatus sees a political opportunity in anticipating a wider outbreak of the virus in the U.S. To that end, Democrats have now reversed course, hitting the administration for a lack of preparedness. Since all the other recent attempts to bring down Trump's administration have crashed and burned so spectacularly, why not try to politicize a potential pandemic?
The New York Post: Criticisms Of Trump's Coronavirus Response Are Sickening By Miranda Devine. Whom better to have as president during the coronavirus epidemic but a renowned germaphobe, the "build-the-wall" guy who refuses to kowtow to China? It's a unique set of characteristics showing that President Trump understood early the need for decisive measures such as travel restrictions on China, which he imposed in January. Yet for that sensible decision — in defiance of the World Health Organization — he was criticized by Democrats such as Joe Biden as xenophobic, and by China as racist. "This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria and xenophobia — hysterical xenophobia — and fearmongering," said Biden the day after the travel restrictions were imposed. Trump's travel restrictions began on Jan. 31. Australia and Singapore instituted their own travel limits the next day. Trump's move bought valuable time to slow the spread of the virus and ease pressure on the nation's health system before a vaccine is developed — which experts believe is at least 18 months away. But that hasn't stopped the barrage of fake criticisms, including that Trump had left the nation dangerously unprepared to cope with a pandemic by cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
