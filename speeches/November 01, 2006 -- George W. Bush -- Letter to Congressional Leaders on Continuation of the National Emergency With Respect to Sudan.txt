    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication,stating that the Sudan emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 2006.
The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency on November 3, 1997, and the expansion of that emergency on April 26, 2006, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and to maintain sanctions against Sudan.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
