Burton endorsed Edwards saying, "I supported John Edwards in the 2004 primaries and I'm proud to support him again because I believe he is the best candidate to lead our country and the best chance Democrats have at taking back the White House. Our country desperately needs John's leadership—he has a clear vision to change our country and detailed plans to provide universal health care and end poverty in America. He is committed to helping working and middle class Americans and building a country that works for every American."
