    HOUSTON, Texas — Bob Vander Plaats issued the following statement regarding Sen. Marco Rubio's false attacks on Ted Cruz:
"It's fair to have policy differences within the Party, and I think it's helpful to have that debate. What we shouldn't do is intentionally mislead Americans about the positions of others — and it's disappointing Senator Rubio has chosen that path," said Vander Plaats. "The record is clear: Senator Rubio supported the Gang of Eight, which granted amnesty and wouldn't have secured the border. Ted Cruz was a leading voice against the Gang of Eight and amnesty, and for securing our border. Perhaps even more disappointing is that Senator Rubio explicitly ran against amnesty to get elected in 2010. I think that deeply hurts his credibility with Iowans as they evaluate who they can trust as president to do what he said he would do."
