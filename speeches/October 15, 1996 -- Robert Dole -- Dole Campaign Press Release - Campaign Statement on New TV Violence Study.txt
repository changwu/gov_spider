    Dole/Kemp Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"Today's UCLA television study is more than just a measure of violence on TV -- it is, to a certain degree, a study in courage. Concerned parents everywhere deserve accolades for pressuring the entertainment industry to cut down on the gratuitous violence in its programming.
"Bob Dole is proud to have been one of the first to speak out on this vital issue. By standing up to the Hollywood elites, Dole showed how a leader can use the bully pulpit to change our children's world for the better. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, has yet to take on his big donors in Hollywood."
"Instead, Clinton put his faith in the yet-to-be-invented V-chip and the yet-to-be-instituted three hours a week of educational programming requirement. If Bill Clinton is serious about getting sex and violence off TV and out of our children's theaters, he should turn down the Hollywood money and turn up the volume on the call for family-friendly viewing."
