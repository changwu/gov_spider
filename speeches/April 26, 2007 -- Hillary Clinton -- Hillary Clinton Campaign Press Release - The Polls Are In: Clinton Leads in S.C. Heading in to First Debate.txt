    The Democrats head into this week's debate in South Carolina with Hillary Clinton holding a consistent lead in the Democratic primary. In the four latest state polls, Clinton leads Barack Obama, South Carolina-born John Edwards, and the rest of the field.
And in those polls that released results among African-Americans (who make up half of the South Carolina Democratic primary electorate), Hillary Clinton has an even bigger lead among these voters.

The League of Conservation Voters poll has Hillary Clinton at 31 percent, Barack Obama at 27 percent and John Edwards at 16 percent.
The National Education Association puts Hillary Clinton ahead with 31 percent of the vote, compared with 28 percent for Obama and 21 percent for Edwards. Among African-American voters, Clinton leads with 40 percent, compared to 35 percent for Obama and 9 percent for Edwards.
The Zogby poll has Hillary Clinton at 33 percent, Barack Obama at 26 percent and John Edwards at 21 percent. Among African-Americans, Clinton leads with 43 percent while Obama has 30 percent and Edwards 7 percent.
The SCIndex poll put Hillary Clinton at 32 percent, Obama at 23 percent and Edwards at 21 percent. Among African-American women, Clinton leads with 41 percent, compared to 29 percent for Barack Obama.

Both the NEA poll and the Zogby poll also show that those who support Hillary Clinton say they support her more strongly and are less likely to change their minds than those who support the other candidates.
