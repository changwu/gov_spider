    Today two Montana businessmen and entrepreneurs, Greg Franks and Greg Trangmoe, endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President. Franks and Trangmoe will serve as Montana State Co-Chairs for Kasich for America.
Greg Franks is the owner of Digital Video Systems in Billings, Montana. He first met John Kasich as a volunteer during a field House Budget Committee hearing held in Billings in February of 1995. Said Franks, "I quickly realized that John Kasich was not the typical politician who just offered lip service â€” he actually said what he was going to do and got it done. Those initial hearings led to the first balanced budget in my lifetime, and it hasn't been done since Kasich left Congress. If our nation is going to get our economy back on track, then we must restore fiscal discipline to Washington, and who better to do that than the last person who got that done."
Greg Trangmoe is a computer engineer and attorney in Stevensville, Montana, providing consulting services to entrepreneurs and start-up businesses. He did not follow politics until he happened upon a 1990s Meet the Press interview with Kasich that thrust him into politics, and led him to becoming a technology advisor for Kasich's 2000 presidential bid. Said Trangmoe, "Kasich's straight-forward message of fiscal responsibility and personal accountability struck a chord and inspired me, and I immediately became a believer in him. Now, two decades later, I know that John Kasich's experience and independence make him the right person to lead our country to renewed prosperity while upholding the values important to Montanans."
Said Kasich, "Franks and Trangmoe are trusted friends and advisors, and I am grateful for the confidence they continue to place in me. They know what it takes to be successful in Montana, and I am thrilled to welcome them to the team."
