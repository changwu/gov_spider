    Supports H.J. Res. 77 to express disapproval of Obama's request to increase debt ceiling in accordance with BCA of 2011
LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul joined his fellow House Republicans in support of a resolution to condemn President Obama's request for the second and last federal debt-ceiling increase authorized under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
The resolution is being circulated by Congressman Tom Reed (NY-29). Reed, Paul, and other House Republicans are signing on to convey their displeasure at the unusual move to skirt fiscal responsibility, and the indignation of their constituents.
"Ron Paul is the nation's foremost advocate for limiting out of control growth and spending in the federal government. It's natural, then, that he would enthusiastically support a gesture to shame President Obama for asking for a debt-ceiling increase so soon after the last one, and for Obama to do so under Executive Branch policies that do nothing to curtail spending," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
