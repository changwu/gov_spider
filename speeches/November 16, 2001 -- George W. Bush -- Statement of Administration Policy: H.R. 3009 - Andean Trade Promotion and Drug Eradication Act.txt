    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Crane (R) IL and 21 cosponsors)
The Administration is committed to extending and expanding the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), which expires on December 4, 2001. Renewal of the ATPA is a high priority for the Administration, as the ATPA represents a critical intersection of our trade and anti-narcotics policies. To achieve a program with the greatest potential benefit to the region and to the United States, the Administration supports as much expanded product coverage as can be agreed by Congress this year. Through strengthening the legitimate economies of the beneficiary countries, the ATPA is a key component of our efforts to combat the scourge of narcotics in the Andean region and in the United States. There are clear links between drug trafficking and terrorism and it is in our national interest to combat the drug trade and to promote healthy, strong economies and democracies. The Administration supports H.R. 3009 as an important step toward achieving these goals.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
Any law that would reduce receipts or increase direct spending is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Accordingly, H.R. 3009, that would reduce revenues, will be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement. The Administration's scoring estimates are under development. The Administration will work with Congress to ensure that any unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current law or the enactment of any other proposals that meet the President's objectives.
