    Today, former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President. Senator Campbell joins other former U.S. Senators who have endorsed John Kasich, including former Majority Leader Trent Lott, former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, and former U.S. Senators from New Hampshire John E. Sununu and Gordon Humphrey. Following Senator Campbell's endorsement, the Kasich for America campaign named him Colorado State Co-Chair.
Said Senator Campbell, "I served in Washington with John Kasich and saw his determination and leadership firsthand. With his vast experience and proven success in both Washington and as governor of Ohio, he is the ideal leader to help get our economy and nation back on track. Additionally, as a strong defender of states' rights, I support the governor's plan to move money, power and influence out of Washington and return it back to the people in the states who understand their local needs far better than the bureaucrats in Washington do. I am honored to endorse him, and I look forward to working with our strong Colorado team to put him in the White House."
