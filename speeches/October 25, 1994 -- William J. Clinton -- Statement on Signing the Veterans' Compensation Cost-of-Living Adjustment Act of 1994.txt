    Today, I have signed into law S. 1927, the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1994."
In signing S. 1927, I am pleased to extend a most deserved benefit to our Nation's servicedisabled veterans and the surviving spouses and children of those who gave their lives in defense of our beloved freedoms. This Act not only maintains the value of benefits so dearly earned, but underscores a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay.
S. 1927 provides a 2.8 percent increase in compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, effective December 1, 1994. This is the same percentage increase that Social Security beneficiaries and veterans' pension recipients will be receiving in January.
I salute the more than two and one-half million individuals who will directly benefit from this increase and all veterans and their families. Moreover, to those proud men and women still in uniform, our actions today bear witness to our Nation's commitment to you for your contributions to our security and well-being.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 25, 1994.
