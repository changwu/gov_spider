    Hi. There you go. Thanks very much for that wonderful warm welcome. And I want to thank Robin for her very kind introduction. And you know I just happened to have the chance this morning to see the next president of the United States of America.
(APPLAUSE)
And he told me to bring along two messages for you. One is, his heartfelt thanks for the enthusiasm and the energy which has sparked this convention because of your participation. We're extremely grateful.
(APPLAUSE)
And the other message is, be sure to watch television tonight, or be right here on the floor because you are going to here a speech that you will always remember. So, be sure to be tuned.
(APPLAUSE)
CROWD: Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole!
DOLE: Hey, boy, you all know how to do it.
(APPLAUSE)
Thanks, well. That's the kind of enthusiasm we need.
(APPLAUSE)
That's great. And let me just say that...
(UNKNOWN): You're beautiful, we love you.
(APPLAUSE)
DOLE: Well...
(APPLAUSE)
I think I just better sit down on that one, don't you? I mean, that's, wow, what a lovely compliment. Thank you. That's great moral support to keep chugging here.
Oh, and let me just say how proud Bob and I are of Robin Dole. You know, she mentioned the fact that she's been working with troubled teens. And I just want to share with you that one weekend -- it was a holiday weekend and we wanted Robin to go with us on a little trip. And she said, to her father and to me, she said, Elizabeth, she said, you know, I've made a commitment to these young woman that I'm working with to meet them on Sunday -- to go to and event with them.
And she said, they've had too many broken promises in their lives. And I'm not going to break my promise to my girls.
(APPLAUSE)
So, she is truly making a difference, a positive difference in the lives of these troubled teens. So many of them have had real problems of neglect or other difficulties, and Robin is really making a difference.
DOLE: And of course, right now she's making a difference in her father's campaign, as well.
And what is the purpose of the campaign? What's this campaign all about? The answer is you right here before me today. Because you are the future, and that's what this campaign is all about -- the future, you.
(APPLAUSE)
And I remember so well a few years ago when Bob told me about some young people who visited his office as majority leader. They came in from every state -- a young man and a young woman, high school students.
And they mentioned to him -- one of the young men said, "You know, Senator Dole, it seems that everyone has a representative. The teachers have someone representing them in Washington, the lawyers have someone, the doctors have someone, the businessmen and women." And he said, "Who represents us, the young people? Who fights for the future? Who fights for the future?"
And Bob said, you know, I've always remembered that question. And he is going to continue fighting for a better future for every one of you, every one of you.
(APPLAUSE)
And this is not a matter of rhetoric with Bob Dole. There's a record that shows he's already done that time and time and time again as the majority leader of the United States Senate.
(APPLAUSE)
Let's look at just a few of those issues that he's fought for. Bob Dole -- and this is 1995, just last year, now -- led the Senate to pass the first balanced budget in a generation. In a generation.
(APPLAUSE)
And you know what happened? President Clinton had campaigned saying he was for a balanced budget. When it went to the White House, he vetoed it, didn't he? He vetoed the balanced budget.
(BOOS)
Now, what would that balanced budget mean for you as young people? First of all, it means that interest rates will drop 2 percent when you balance the budget. So if you want a home loan, a student loan, a car loan, whatever, business loan, it's going to cost you a lot less, isn't it?
Not only that, but when you have children, a child born today can expect to pay $ 187,000 in that child's lifetime just to pay the interest on the national debt.
Why in the world would we pass that on to you and to your children? What a terrible legacy.
Now, Bob Dole, as president, I guarantee you, will balance the budget and he will, on the first day he's in office, submit a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.
(APPLAUSE)
Now, let's talk about taxes for a minute.
DOLE: Anybody want to reduce taxes?
(APPLAUSE)
Bob Dole led the Senate in 1995 to pass legislation that would have cut taxes $ 245 billion. And, once again, it was vetoed. Another veto.
Remember the promise when Bill Clinton was running for office? I'm going to give you a tax cut, middle income Americans.
And what did he give us? A veto of Bob's legislation and the biggest tax increase, literally, in the history of the United States of America. That's what he gave us.
(BOOS)
Now, why is it important to you to have that tax cut? Well it means that you can keep more of your hard-earned income for yourselves, for your family. And right now...
(APPLAUSE)
Don't you think something is terribly wrong when the average worker has to work three our every eight hours just to pay his or her taxes?
CROWD: (Yes!)
DOLE: When we pay more in taxes than we pay for food, shelter and clothing combined? When most people, average people, have to work all the way up to May 7, just to get their taxes paid before they can consider their income their own? Something's wrong.
Well, let me guarantee you, with Bob Dole, you're going to have a fairer, flatter, simpler tax system, and also -- here's a big one -- we're going to get rid of the IRS as we know it.
(APPLAUSE)
I thought you'd like that one.
(APPLAUSE)
Now, let's talk about crime and drugs for a moment, because, heaven knows, this is an area that affects our society today, that's undermining our families.
As we all know, drug use among youth has been skyrocketing in the last three years; 13 years there was a decline. Now, marijuana use is skyrocketing -- also, LSD, cocaine, the rest. So, we've got a major problem that has to be turned around. And we're going to fight crime and fight drugs and it's going to be an all-out war.
(APPLAUSE)
Bob Dole is going to appoint judges who'll be tough on crime, tough on crime, as strict constructionists.
(APPLAUSE)
And there won't be silence from the White House as there is now on the drug issue. There'll be a war on drugs. Bob Dole will be speaking up constantly, helping our young people to say, "No" -- to say, "No."
(APPLAUSE)
Also, when I think about what my husband went through in World War II, he and I want to make certain that not one of you in this room ever has to have that experience. And you can be sure, as commander- in-chief, he will do everything to ensure peace through strength.
Now, let's look at the record.
(APPLAUSE)
You'll remember when you look at the record, when Bill Clinton was campaigning for office and he said, I'm going to cut defense, maybe $ 60 billion. He was elected and he slashed $ 127 billion out of the defense budget.
A year or so later, he went up to Congress to present his State of the Union message and he said, I'm not going to cut defense any more.
DOLE: And then his budget went up shortly thereafter that, and again, it slashed billions and billions more out of defense. So, Bob Dole had to keep putting in what Bill Clinton took out, because they were cutting defense too far too fast.
And we want to make certain that the military never becomes again a hollow military. You know, when my husband was training in World War II, they trained with broomsticks because we weren't ready.
We can never let that happen again.
And while we may think, well, you know, there's nothing to fear because the Evil Empire's gone, pretty much. Well, there's plenty of threats, aren't there? All around the world there are lots of threats out there.
And we have to make sure that we are strong so that no tyrant, no terrorist will ever again threaten the United States of America.
(APPLAUSE)
And, certainly, we want to make sure that every young person gets a great education and that you're able to go as far as your skills and talents will take you well prepared. And that's why I'm very proud that Bob wants to offer those opportunity scholarships so that lower- income and middle-income parents will have the same opportunities that wealthy parents have today to choose the school that's best for their child which...
(APPLAUSE)
Hi. How are you all doing down here?
And that school may be outside their district or it may be a private school or it may be a religious school, but everyone should have the opportunity for the best education that can be provided.
So, let me just conclude here with a little test, now. And now schools out, at least for a while. Maybe, I think some schools are starting up again fairly quickly, aren't they? It's getting late August here.
But, anyway, let's take a quick test now. I want to know when you all leave San Diego, how many of you are going to continue to work hard to make Bob Dole president of the United States of America?
(APPLAUSE)
Great. Wow.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. I like it.
CROWD: Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole!
DOLE: Wow. My poor (OFF-MIKE).
CROWD: Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole!
DOLE: Wow. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
Great!
And now I want to know, next question -- everybody sit down...
(LAUGHTER)
... so you can stand again.
(LAUGHTER)
How many are going to be 18 years old and going to polls to vote and bring along every single friend, neighbor and person you can find to vote for Bob for president?
(APPLAUSE)
DOLE: Great. All right.
Thank you. Thank you, OK.
(LAUGHTER)
What's the last one?
How many people feel that Bob Dole is the better man who will lead America to a better future?
(APPLAUSE)
Great.
CROWD: Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole!
DOLE: Thank you.
CROWD: Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole!
(APPLAUSE)
DOLE: Thank you. OK.
Let me tell you, you all passed that test with flying colors. And with your help and God willing, Bob Dole will pass his test with flying colors on November 5, 1996.
Thank you, and God bless you.
Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
