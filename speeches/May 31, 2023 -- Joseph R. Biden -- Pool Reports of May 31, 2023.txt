In-town pool report #10/Biden remarks after summer hazard briefing
Please see the following report on Biden remarks that were delivered earlier to the pool during a spray in the Roosevelt Room following his summer hazard briefing from cabinet members and other administration leaders. (His debt ceiling remark, fully transcribed, is at the bottom.)
BIDEN REMARKS ABOUT SUMMER HAZARDS AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
(Checked audio against WH livestream playback: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Vtfc5imt0)
Biden said he received a "significant briefing" from cabinet members regarding severe weather preparedness.
"Last year hurricanes and other extreme weather events in the United States caused over $165 billion dollars in damage."
Regarding Typhoon Mawar that last week hit Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands that caused "tremendous damage," Biden said: "Our hearts go out to the people who are affected. But the pace of the recovery there is an example of the importance of investing in our infrastructure." He cited recently installed cement utility poles and electric and communications systems in Guam.
"Summer is bringing a more active wildfire season to the United States. This year alone wildfires have destroyed an area almost as big as the state of Maryland." Biden added that over the past two years, a third of Americans have been "personally affected" by extreme weather and said the impacts of climate change are "rapidly intensifying."
Biden said his Investing in America agenda includes new investments "to make communities stronger, make our communities more resilient."
He cited the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act -- "They both include record funding to increase community resilience to drought, flooding and wildfires."
"For example, I'm traveling to Colorado this afternoon where the Forest Service is funding $1.1 million to treat 600 acres of hazardous fuel such as trees and brush."
Biden also said his administration has invested in advanced satellite technology to predict the paths of wildfires and storms, and said his administration has funded 130 water projects "to address the drought crisis in the West, including projects that are going to conserve tens of millions of gallons of water in drought-stricken areas like the Colorado River Basin."
Biden said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NOAA have funded hundreds of projects across the U.S. to address flood and coastal resilience.
Biden said the U.S. is "hardening the electric grid to withstand stronger storms."
Biden promoted Build.gov as a way to track, by region, infrastructure developments under his administration.
"I want to close by thanking the brave Americans, and I mean that sincerely, the brave Americans who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. The firefighters and first responders including FEMA personnel who run toward the danger while everyone else runs the other way."
Added that the U.S. has firefighters in Canada right now helping to battle a current wildfire raging in Nova Scotia.
REPORTERS SHOUTED QUESTIONS ABOUT DEBT CEILING
Reporters shouted questions over each other. No question was singled out by the president.
Biden quipped to cabinet members at the table with him that he predicted reporters would not ask him anything about severe weather preparedness.
"I told these guys you wouldn't ask anything about what we just talked about. Was I right? I just wanted to show you I was right," he said to the leaders at the table.
"We're going to deal with the debt ceiling. I think things are going as planned. God willing I'll be landing in Colorado tonight in preparation for my commencement speech at the Air Force Academy tomorrow. By the I land Congress will have acted, the House will have acted and we'll be one step closer. Thank you very much."
