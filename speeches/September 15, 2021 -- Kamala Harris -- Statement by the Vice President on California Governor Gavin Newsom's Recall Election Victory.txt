    Congratulations to my friend, Governor Gavin Newsom. The pandemic has reminded us who we can count on, and Californians know they can count on Governor Newsom. He is focused on beating back COVID-19, and helping the state make a big comeback. In resoundingly rejecting this recall attempt, California's voters made it clear that the American people want leaders who stand for women's rights, voting rights, and workers' rights.
