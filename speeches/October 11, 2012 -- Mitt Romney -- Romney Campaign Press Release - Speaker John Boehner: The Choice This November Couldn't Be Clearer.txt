    Speaker of the House John Boehner made the following statement on tonight's vice-presidential debate:
"Tonight, voters heard two distinct visions for the future of our country. Vice President Biden promised four more years of higher taxes, skyrocketing debt, and painfully high unemployment while Congressman Ryan outlined a plan for a real recovery that will create jobs, provide tax relief for the middle class, and clear the cloud of debt that is dragging on our economy. Â The choice for Americans in November is a big one, and Paul Ryan detailed a clear vision for a prosperous, thriving economy that fosters private sector job creation and opportunity for all."
