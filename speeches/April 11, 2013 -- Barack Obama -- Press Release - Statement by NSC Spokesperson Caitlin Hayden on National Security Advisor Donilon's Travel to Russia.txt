    National Security Advisor Tom Donilon will travel to Moscow April 14-15 to meet with senior Russian officials and review next steps in our bilateral relationship, as well as a range of key foreign policy, security, and economic issues on our international agenda. This visit offers an important opportunity to consult with senior officials ahead of President Obama's meetings with President Putin later this year.
