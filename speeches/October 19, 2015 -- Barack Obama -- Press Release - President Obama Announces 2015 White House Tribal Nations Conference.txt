Each federally recognized tribe will be invited to send one representative to the conference. This will be the seventh White House Tribal Nations Conference for the Obama Administration, and continues to build upon the President's commitment to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and to improve the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, with an emphasis on increasing opportunity for Native youth.
