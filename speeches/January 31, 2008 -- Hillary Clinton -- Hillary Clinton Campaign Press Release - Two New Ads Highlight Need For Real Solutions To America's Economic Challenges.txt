    With the stakes higher than ever, the Clinton Campaign today launched two new ads in February 5th states across the country touting Hillary's ability to tackle the economic challenges facing America
The first 30-second spot, entitled "Free Fall," features a skydiver free falling as headlines flash across the screen detailing the housing foreclosure crisis and stock market woes. As the parachute opens, the ad makes the case that Hillary is the candidate who can address the problems plaguing our economy and protect our children's future.
In the second 30-second spot, entitled "Can Do," Hillary vows to carry Americans' voices with her to the White House and bring people together to solve America's problems. The ad outlines her plan to jumpstart our economy and create millions of new jobs.

"Free Fall"

[Announcer] Our economy could be heading into freefall.

[On Screen] Free fall continues. More newspaper headlines.

For millions of Americans, foreclosures, interest rates, and health care costs are spinning out of control.

With your job and family security in the balance, the stakes have never been higher in choosing our new president.

The person you can depend on to fix the economy and protect our future.

[On Screen] Still shot of Hillary Clinton

[Hillary Clinton:] I'm Hillary Clinton and approved this message.
Hillary for President
"Can Do"

[Hillary Clinton:] Americans still have that can-do spirit.

We know you can't solve economic problems with political promises.

The stakes are too high, the future too important.

We can turn our economy around and build a new age of prosperity.

I will bring more than my 35 years of experience to the White House.

I will bring your voice... and your spirit.

We are Americans, and together there's no problem we can't solve...

I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message because the stakes have never been higher.
