    LOS ANGELES, CA-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today called for a new American energy doctrine in a speech at the Green Xchange Global Conference in Los Angeles, California.
"The climate cannot tolerate the indecision of our leaders," Richardson said. "We need bold action now to fix the situation. My energy plan consistently has been measured as the boldest, most integrated, and most comprehensive platform offered by any candidate.
"It is going to take more than having the right stance on the issues. I am the only Democratic candidate who has real executive experience on energy, security, and the environment. The best plan will work only if the next President challenges the nation and commits to moving quickly."
Governor Richardson proposed that the United States return to its rightful place as a world leader.
"By adopting strong energy rules and incentives at home, we will show the world the America that it used to see-- an innovative country that leads by example," Richardson said. "As we make these changes at home, we also will conduct international negotiations aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
"We need real diplomacy. I have been tested as a diplomat throughout my career, and I will bring that experience to the negotiating table."
Richardson elaborates on his energy doctrine in his new book Leading by Example: How We Can Inspire an Energy and Security Revolution.
