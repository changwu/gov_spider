"Wall Street banks shower Washington politicians with campaign contributions and speaking fees," the narrator says as the ad opens. "And what do they get for it? A rigged economy, tax breaks and bailouts."
"$200,000 an hour for them, but not even 15 bucks an hour for all Americans. Enough is enough" the ad concludes.
