    I welcome the Japanese Diet's approval for ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This action is a singularly important event in the life of the treaty, which is a pillar of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to contribute to the broader goal of nuclear arms control.
Japan, one of our closest allies, has one of the world's most extensive, peaceful nuclear programs. Ratification of the treaty will clearly add to the treaty's vitality and effectiveness and to the extension of the international safeguards regime. It should also facilitate Japan's peaceful nuclear endeavors and enhance Japan's influence on nuclear arms control.
As I have frequently stated, our efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation are receiving high priority. I am encouraged by the progress being made in this field. We are thus especially gratified by this further demonstration of Japanese dedication to the same goal. We trust that Japan's example will encourage yet broader adherence to the treaty and its objectives.
