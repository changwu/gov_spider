Pool Report 6/No Qs
President Biden left the State Dining Room at 3:47 after mingling with guests and posing for many selfies. He did not answer reporter questions.
Immediately ater signing the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, Biden heard and looked quizzically at journalists who shouted questions about what he's doing to reopen the Black Sea and about why he hasn't sanctioned Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, who allegedly did business with his son.
Another journalist asked a question about Jamal Khashoggi.
A fourth journalist loudly shouted at the president: "Why have you stopped taking questions from the press? What are you afraid of?"

Pool Report 8/Briefing room event
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine are hosting a briefing room Q&A with parents to discuss the baby formula crisis.
There's at least one baby stroller and a smattering of infant wails.
The pool was not informed of the event and it's unclear if the footage will be released publicly.

Pool Report 9/Formula event over
The briefing room Q&A with parents about the baby formula crisis ended without any questions going to White House reporters, who joined the event as it was underway.
Many of the parents seemed to be bloggers or representatives of parents groups.
Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus coordinator, joined Jean-Pierre and Admiral Levine on the stage and took some parent questions on COVID-19 vaccines.
As the briefing ended, members of the White House press corps asked Jha and Levine if they would stay for some additional press questions, but Jean-Pierre led them off stage.
As they departed, a reporter shouted, "Admiral Levine, could you share any information about when President Biden learned of the baby formula crisis and who briefed him?" She did not respond.
After departing the room, Levine returned moments later to pose for photos with babies behind the podium
"Admiral Levine, are you able to say anything about when President Biden was briefed?" a reporter asked Levine near the podium.
"I'm not answering any questions. Thank you. Nice to meet you, though," Levine replied.
