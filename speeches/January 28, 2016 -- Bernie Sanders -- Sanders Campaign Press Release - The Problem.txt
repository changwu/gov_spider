    DES MOINES, Iowa â€“ A new ad released by U.S Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Thursday, details how too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks have rigged the nation's economic and political systems in their favor at the expense of working families.
Goldman Sachs "just settled with authorities for their part in the crisis that put seven million out of work and millions out of their homes," the narrator explains.
"Our economy works for Wall Street because it's rigged by Wall Street and that's the problem," the ad says. "As long as Washington is bought and paid for we can't build an economy that works for people."
Sanders has proposed a plan, backed by 170 economists and financial experts, to remake the financial system to serve America's working families.
