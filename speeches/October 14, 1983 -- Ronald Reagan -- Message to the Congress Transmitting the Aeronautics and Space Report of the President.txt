    I am pleased to transmit this report of the Nation's progress in space and aeronautics during calendar 1982, Aeronautics and Space Report of the President, 1982 Activities. It is provided in accordance with Section 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2476).
Inauguration of operational flights of the Space Transportation System in 1982 promises greatly broadened contributions from space now and for the Nation's future. Following the Shuttle's earlier test flights, which carried scientific experiments into space as well as the first Department of Defense payload, the first operational mission delivered two commercial satellites to orbit, demonstrating that the Space Shuttle provides practical, utilitarian, round-trip access to space.
Other space projects expanded vital civil and military communications, weather observation, earth resources monitoring, and studies of life sciences, the earth, the sun, and the universeâ€”supporting the national space policy goals I enunciated in July 1982. In outlining the space policy, I reaffirmed the United States commitment to explore and use space for the national well-being and to maintain U.S. leadership in space transportation, space science, applications, and technology.
Aeronautics projects in 1982 advanced new technology for both civil and military aircraft and supported the strong aeronautical industry essential to the Nation's security and economy. Research in basic technology continued to uphold U.S. leadership in aviation.
The Nation can be proud of these and other achievements reported for 1982.
