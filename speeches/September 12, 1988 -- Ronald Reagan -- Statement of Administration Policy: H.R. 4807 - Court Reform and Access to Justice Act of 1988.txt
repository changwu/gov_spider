    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kastenmeier (D) Wisconsin)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4807 but will seek amendments in the Senate to restrict or eliminate the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to hear cases on the basis of diversity of citizenship and to provide for a "legal impact statement," as recommended by the Department of Justice in its testimony of October 14, 1987, before the House Judiciary Committee. These reforms will help to alleviate the heavy caseload of the Federal judiciary and ensure that the Federal courts are able to concentrate on cases of truly national or Federal significance.
