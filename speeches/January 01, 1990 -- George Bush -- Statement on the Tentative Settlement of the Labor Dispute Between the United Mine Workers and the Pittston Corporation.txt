    I am delighted with the news that the collective-bargaining process has produced a tentative agreement that will bring an end to the 9-month-old dispute between members of the United Mine Workers and the Pittston Corporation. Secretary Dole, [Federal mediator] Bill Usery, Rich Trumka of the United Mine Workers, and Paul Douglas of the Pittston Corporation deserve congratulations for their work in achieving this agreement. And I want to wish the families and communities of the mineworkers a very happy New Year, as they look forward to the benefits of a new contract.
