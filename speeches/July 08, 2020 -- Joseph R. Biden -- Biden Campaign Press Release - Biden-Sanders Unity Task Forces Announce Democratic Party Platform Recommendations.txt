    Today, Biden for President and Friends of Bernie Sanders released the following statements on the Platform Recommendations submitted by the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces.
"For the millions of Americans facing hardship due to President Trump's failed coronavirus response, this election offers the chance to usher in a stronger, fairer economy that works for our working families," said Vice President Joe Biden. "I commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to Senator Sanders for working together to unite our party, and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come."
"While Joe Biden and I, and our supporters, have strong disagreements about some of the most important issues facing our country, we also understand that we must come together in order to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history," said Senator Bernie Sanders. "I want to thank all the members of the six task forces who worked hard and in good faith to create these compromise agreements. Though the end result is not what I or my supporters would have written alone, the task forces have created a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction and substantially improve the lives of working families throughout our country. I look forward to working with Vice President Biden to help him win this campaign and to move this country forward toward economic, racial, social, and environmental justice."
