    Rudy Giuliani National Campaign Co-Chair and Senior Policy Advisor Steve Forbes made the following statement today regarding the Club for Growth White Paper:
"In praising Mayor Giuliani's 'years of remarkable fiscal discipline', the Club for Growth confirmed today why many conservatives agree with me that Rudy is the true fiscal conservative we need as President. Mayor Giuliani used fiscally conservative principles to achieve unprecedented pro-growth results in the nation's largest city and one of it's most liberal."
"We need a President that can actually turn conservative philosophy into real results as Rudy did when he cut taxes and limited spending in New York City for the first time in history."
