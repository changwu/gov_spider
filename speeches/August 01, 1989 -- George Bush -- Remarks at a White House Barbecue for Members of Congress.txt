    Well, what a great, sheer pleasure it is to have these Oak Ridge Boys here at the White House, and what a marvelous evening! Richard and Duane and Joe are in good health, but Steve got out of a sickbed to join us here tonight, and I want to thank him, especially, for being with us. And let me just say on behalf of our family -- I loved that family song -- and on behalf of our family, dispersed to the winds -- Barbara is sick at heart that she's not here, but she's looking after the grandchildren in Maine and sends her greetings.
These are not easy days, either in the Congress or in the White House. There are some overwhelming events that concern everybody here. But even though they're complicated times, I think an evening like this, of just plain relaxation with friends, is very, very significant and very important. And I'm grateful to all these people on the stage and their families who are with us -- and some of their kids are here -- for bringing us this touch of joy, touch of brightness in our lives.
And to every Member of Congress here, let me just repeat that this is a special evening for me -- a special evening, I think, for our country -- when we can have the executive branch, and many of my associates in that branch here tonight, and the legislative branch come together in a spirit of just plain good will. Thank you all very, very much. And once again, my heartfelt thanks to the Oak Ridge Boys. They are fantastic.
