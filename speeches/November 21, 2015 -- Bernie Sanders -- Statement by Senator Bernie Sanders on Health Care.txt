    CHARLESTON, S.C. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday issued the following statement:
"I am disappointed that Secretary Clinton does not think we should join every other major country in guaranteeing health care through a cost-effective, Medicare-for-all, single-payer system that would save the average family about $5,000 a year.
"Further, I am surprised that Secretary Clinton now opposes Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's Family and Medical Leave Act which is supported by 19 other Senate Democrats and more than 100 House Democrats.
"The middle class is disappearing and we need bold action to rebuild it."
