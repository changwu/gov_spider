    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to the United Nations Human Rights Council vote in condemnation of Israel:
"Our single vote in opposition is just and the abstentions of our friends are welcome, but at this point they are meaningless gestures. It is time to stop ceding moral authority to the UNHRC and tell the truth about this hopelessly biased and anti-Semitic institution. There is no equivalency between Israel's right to self-defense and Hamas' genocidal aggression against the Jewish people. There is no equivalence between Israel's extraordinary efforts to protect civilians and Hamas' use of the Palestinian people as human shields. Being party to any body that believes there is only perpetuates this injustice. The United States should stop legitimizing the UNHRC with our membership and withdraw now."
