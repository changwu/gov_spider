    Re: Notification Pursuant to Public Law 94-505
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
This is to advise the Senate that I have today exercised my power as President to remove from office the current appointee to the position of Deputy Inspector General (Acting Inspector General) for the Department of Health And Human Services. The removed appointee may be involved in investigations which would be aided by some continued association with his office. We will want to review these situations to consider asking him to continue his participation on an appropriate basis.
Uncovering fraud, waste and mismanagement of federal funds as well as the promotion of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of federal programs and operations will be an important priority in my Administration. The Deputy Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services will have a critical role in the achievement of this objective. As is the case with regard to all positions where I, as President, have the power of appointment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the ability, integrity and commitment of the appointee to the position of Deputy Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services.
I will be submitting to the Senate in the near future my nomination of an individual for this position who has my confidence and who meets the appropriate qualifications. If this individual wishes to be considered for reappointment, he may indicate his interest and he will be judged in competition with other applicants.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
