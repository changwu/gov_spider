    Lt. General James H. Doolittle's life spanned a period of American history that combined vast technological advancements with unparalleled change in our Nation's world role. At every step along the way, General Doolittle was among this Nation's trusted leaders.
General Doolittle was a pioneer in aviation. An accomplished and acclaimed airman in the years between the World Wars, he helped push the envelope of aviation and ensured that the United States was at the forefront of this emerging technology. When America entered the Second World War, General Doolittle's daring and courage emboldened an anxious and uncertain Nation. He gave the world its first example of the steel that would allow the United States to lead the Allies to victory. In peacetime, he again served the Nation as a leader in industry and aerospace.
General Doolittle's love for his Nation will long survive him. His willingness to serve his country despite personal danger will long stand as an example of the grit and determination that has driven our Nation since its founding. Hillary joins me in mourning the loss of a patriot, a pioneer, and a hero.
