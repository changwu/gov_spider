    SANTA FE, NM -- Democratic Presidential candidate Governor Bill Richardson will be attending the AFSCME Forum in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, June 19th at 8:00 am. At 9:00 am, Governor Richardson will address the Take Back America Conference. In his remarks to the Take Back America Conference, Governor Richardson will outline his progressive agenda for moving America forward -- in particular, his plan for ending the war in Iraq and bringing every American soldier home by the end of this calendar year.
"I am optimistic about the future of our country," said Governor Richardson. "We must begin the hard work of making our nation energy independent and ending the bloodshed in Iraq."
Governor Richardson will be introduced at the Take Back America Conference by the Bolanos brothers. Born to an immigrant father, all four brothers volunteered for service in Vietnam, making them the only family in the United States to have four brothers serve in that conflict at the same time.
"It is an honor to be introduced by four men so dedicated to the security of our nation and the protection of our values," said Governor Richardson. "These patriots believe, as I do, that the only way to properly honor our troops in Iraq is to bring them home now."
