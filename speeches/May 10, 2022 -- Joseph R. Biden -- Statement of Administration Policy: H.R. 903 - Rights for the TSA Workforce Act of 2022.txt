    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Thompson, D-MS, and 231 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 903, the Rights for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Workforce Act of 2022. This legislation is an important step in ensuring equitable pay for the TSA workforce and is aligned with the 2023 President's Budget request to improve pay for TSA employees. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact and fund this important legislation.
