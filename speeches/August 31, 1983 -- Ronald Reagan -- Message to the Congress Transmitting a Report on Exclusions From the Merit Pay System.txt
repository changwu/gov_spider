    To the Congress of the United States:
Supervisors and management officials in GS-13, 14, and 15 positions throughout the Federal Government are covered by the Merit Pay System as required by Chapter 54, Title 5, U.S. Code, unless otherwise excluded by law.
Upon proper application from the heads of affected agencies and upon recommendation of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, I have, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5401(b)(2)(B), excluded three agencies and units of agencies from coverage under the Merit Pay System.
Attached is my report describing the agencies and units of agencies to be excluded and the reasons therefor.
