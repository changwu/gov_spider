    Columbia, SC — Following Wednesday's debate — where Cory Booker commanded the audience and proved, once again, why he is the strongest candidate in this race — Cory for South Carolina announced that seven South Carolina elected officials, activists, and community leaders endorsed him in this race. This latest round of endorsements adds to a growing list of South Carolinians supporting Booker for president.
"On stage Wednesday, Cory was commanding and presidential, and that clearly resonated with leaders here in South Carolina," said Christale Spain, Cory for South Carolina state director. "In question after question, he presented his vision for our country and showed why he is the best candidate to unify this nation and take on Donald Trump. As Cory said, 'At this moral moment in America, we need leaders who will inspire us to fight again' — and that's exactly what he will do as our nominee and as our president. We're proud to have these leaders stand with us in this fight."
The newly-announced endorsers are:

Quin Cureton, School Board Member, Newberry, SC
Verhonda Crawford, City Council Member, Chesnee, SC
Darreyl Davis, School Board Member, Fairfield, SC
Hamilton Grant, South Carolina State University Trustee
Alana Grant, Small Business Owner, Columbia, SC
Frenchi King, Pastor of Trinity Baptist Church, Florence, SC
Terry Davis, City Council Member, Mullins, SC

Cory Booker has held 67 public events in South Carolina since announcing his candidacy for president in February. Last week, Cory for South Carolina announced that more than a hundred women community leaders have endorsed Booker as part of their "Women for Cory" rollout.
