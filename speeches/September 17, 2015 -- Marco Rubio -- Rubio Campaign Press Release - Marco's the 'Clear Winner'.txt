Rubio is just hitting home runs all night. Really surprised how little time Cruz has gotten.

incoming from conservative activists so far: @CarlyFiorina @marcorubio getting ++ reviews. @ScottWalker better this time. #CNNDebate — John King (@JohnKingCNN) September 17, 2015
Marco Rubio is not a showman, so he doesn't speak much. But when he does, he has not stumbled at all tonight. #GOPDebate #CNNDebate

For the second half of the debate, could any of the others touch @marcorubio in terms of substance, fluency, passion? Bravo, Marco! — Michael Medved (@MedvedSHOW) September 17, 2015


Rubio is crushing it. And he's right: Ask Trump detailed foreign policy questions as his new best friend Hugh did.

On foreign policy, it's Rubio's show. No surprise there, but there's no one on that stage that comes close. #GOPDebate

I keep waiting for Rubio to screw up. I am still waiting....

That was about 20 minutes before the end of the debate. Don't worry — Stu's still waiting.
