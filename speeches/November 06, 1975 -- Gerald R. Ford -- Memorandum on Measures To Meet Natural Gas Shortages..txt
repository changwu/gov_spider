    Memorandum for Members of the Energy Resources Council
Subject: Coordinating Near-Term Natural Gas Activities
Last May, the Federal Energy Administration was given responsibility for leading an interagency effort to develop policy recommendations to deal with projected natural gas shortages for this winter. In August, I approved recommendations from the ERC, including proposed legislation and administrative actions.
I have asked Frank Zarb, in his capacity as Executive Director of the Energy Resources Council, to assume responsibility for coordinating efforts of the agencies represented on the Energy Resources Council concerned with expected natural gas shortages. I also have asked that the activities of ERC agencies be conducted in close cooperation with those of the Federal Power Commission.
I trust each of you will extend to him and to the interagency task force he has established full cooperation on this critical and urgent matter.
