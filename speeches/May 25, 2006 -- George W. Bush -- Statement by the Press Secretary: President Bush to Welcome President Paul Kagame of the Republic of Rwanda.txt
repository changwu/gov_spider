    President Bush will welcome President Paul Kagame of the Republic of Rwanda to the White House on Wednesday, May 31, 2006. President Bush looks forward to discussing our excellent bilateral relations, including Rwanda's successful participation in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The leaders will also discuss Rwanda's strides toward reconciliation, democracy, and inclusiveness, and the important role of women in advancing these vital objectives. The United States' role in Rwanda's economic growth and development through trade, investment, and assistance will also be discussed. President Bush will take this opportunity to recognize Rwanda's contributions to stability in the Great Lakes region, as well as its peacekeeping contributions in Sudan.
