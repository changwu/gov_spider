    I AM very pleased to have the report on financing health care of the aged prepared by the bipartisan National Committee on Health Care of the Aged under the sponsorship of Senators Anderson and Javits.
The thoughtful proposals of this expert group of leaders from medicine, education, industry, and insurance should prove extremely helpful in our effort to obtain action in the Congress on this vital matter. I was very pleased to see that the report endorses the fundamental principle of financing certain basic health costs of our older citizens through the social security system; and I look forward to working with the members and sponsors of this Committee in ending the long neglect of this growing national problem. This report makes sure the enactment by this Congress of this badly needed legislation.
