    Today, Great Britain lost a leader with a strong will and strong convictions, and the United States lost a stalwart friend. I had the privilege of being in Margaret Thatcher's company numerous times when she was Prime Minister, and she was always forthright in her views and undaunted in her commitment to advancing her nation's interests. I'm glad I had the chance to know her, and today the Thatcher family is in my thoughts and prayers.
