    President Biden's economic plan is working. A new poll from Gallup finds that a record 59.2% of Americas say they're thriving – the highest rating since the question was first asked more than 13 years ago. This comes on the heels of consumer confidence hitting its highest level since March 2020. The Consumer Confidence Index – a measure of consumers' assessments of the economy – increased from 120 in May to 127.3 in June, exceeding consensus expectations of 119.0. This latest increase in June marks the fourth straight month of gains, as Americans continue to feel the results of President Biden's historic economic and health plans.
It's clear: thanks to President Biden's leadership, Americans are thriving and more optimistic about current economic conditions, as well as the future.
