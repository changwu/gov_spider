On Russia's bombing rebels in Syria:

This is part of a very cunning strategy on the part of Putin. What he's saying, is I'm going to destroy all the non-ISIS fighters and I'm going to turn to the world and say, "Okay, the only two people left in Syria are ISIS and Assad. We're on Assad's side, whose side are you on?" He wants to eliminate any other option to toppling Assad.
On the creation of a "safe zone" in Syria:

We're doing nothing to help those people on the ground, which is why I've said we need to create a safe zone in Syria, with the cooperation of our allies. And that will address three points: Number 1, allowing a non-radical-jihadist group to organize and prepare themselves. Number 2, to stem some of this flow of migrants that are leaving the region and going into Europe. If they had a place they could stay safely, they wouldn't make that journey. And number 3, to ultimately have something in place for a future without Assad.
