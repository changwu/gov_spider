    President Bush. Tonight I'll have a statement; His Majesty will have a statement; and then we'll ask you all to leave. We've got some business to do.
First, Your Majesty, welcome to the Oval Office. It is such an honor to have you here. America has got a great friend in the Kingdom of Bahrain. It's a place where we've had longstanding relations, a place where we've had mil-to-mil relations for, I think, nearly 50 years. And you have been a stalwart when it comes to peace, and we're so appreciative that you're here.
His Majesty hopes that we're able toâ€” like me, hopes that we're able to resolve this issue peacefully in Iraq. But if Saddam Hussein does not disarm, for the sake of peace and security for not only the people in the region, for people here in America, we will go in and disarm him. And I have made that clear to His Majesty in prior conversations. He fully understands the position of the United States, and he has been incredibly supportive, for which I'm grateful.
Welcome.
King Hamad. Thank you, Mr. President.
And I thank the President for his wonderful reception and the clear objectives for security and development, especially in our region.
And this is something we really need at this level of leadership. The decisionmaking process and the objectives are very clear concerning the well-being of the people of the region and of the world. And I thank him for receiving me today.
I came all the way from Bahrain to here, really to show this warm relationship and to support the President in what he's doing for our stability and purpose.
Thank you very much.
President Bush. Thanks very much. Thanks. I appreciate you coming.
