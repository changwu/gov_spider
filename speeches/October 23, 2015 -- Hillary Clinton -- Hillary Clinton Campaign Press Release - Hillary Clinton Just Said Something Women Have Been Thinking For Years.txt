Hillary has never been afraid to speak her mind, especially when it comes to defending women and girls. At the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum this morning, she didn't hold back. Here are three of her most powerful quotes:
1. Anyone who is sick of Hillary standing up for women had better get ready for a long campaign.


2. She said something women have known for years.


3. And she called out GOP hypocrisy.
