    Good morning, everybody. I just want to say very quickly, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to meet with my colleagues from the south and participate in the meeting. UNASUR is doing some excellent work in their efforts in the region on things like energy and security. I have a lot to learn, and I very much look forward to listening and figuring out how we can work together more effectively. So hopefully, the meeting itself will go more smoothly than getting you guys in to take pictures. [Laughter]
All right? Thank you, everybody.
