    I am deeply grateful to the Members of both parties in the House who joined together today to take a wise, courageous step forward for America. This bipartisan vote in support of recommendations by the Scowcroft Commission sends an important signal to the world: Americans are uniting in a common search to protect our security, reduce the level of nuclear weapons, and strengthen the peace.
We now look to the Senate to send this same message by supporting the resolution the House passed today. The challenge before us remains great, and I will continue to consult and work closely with Members of the Congress on both sides of the aisle.
