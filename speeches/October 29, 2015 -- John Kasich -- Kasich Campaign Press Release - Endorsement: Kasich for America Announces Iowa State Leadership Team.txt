Today, in advance of Ohio Gov. John Kasich's Monday, November 2 visit to Iowa, 28 current and former public officials and business and community leaders endorsed John Kasich for President, and were named to the Iowa State Leadership Team. The Leadership Team will work under the direction of State Rep. Mary Ann Hanusa, Kasich for America's Iowa State Campaign Chair, and former Speaker of the Iowa House Brent Siegrist, both of whom previously endorsed Gov. Kasich.
Included among those who announced today is Iowa State Representative David Sieck, the former president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association. Said Rep. Sieck, "I am excited to join the Kasich Team. It is important to have a President from the Midwest â€“ someone who not only understands agriculture, but who holds the common-sense conservative values that Midwesterners share. John Kasich has an unmatched record of success both in Washington and Ohio to share with Iowans, and I look forward to helping him do that in the weeks and months ahead."
"We have an incredible team in Iowa," said Kasich. "Mary Ann Hanusa is a strong, remarkable leader, and with the respected officials and activists we have added to the team today, our operation continues to strengthen and grow. I am particularly excited to welcome aboard Representative Sieck. His understanding of the state and of the concerns of Iowans will prove immensely valuable as the campaign continues to move forward."
