    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after the Federal Reserve announced that it would hold off on raising interest rates:
"It is good news that the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates today. At a time when real unemployment is over 10 percent, we need to do everything possible to create millions of good-paying jobs and raise the wages of the American people. It is now time for the Fed to act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago."
