Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U.S. Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion...Retweets: 18912Favorites: 82459

.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee I wonder if they helped him make the choice!Retweets: 20471Favorites: 86807

The @USNavy's first female Admiral Alene Duerk once said: 'It was a nice distinction to have and to be recognized as the first but I wanted to make certain that I used that notoriety to do as much positive as I could.' Alene did just that and America is forever grateful! https://t.co/tOqkzqGVG7Retweets: 12594Favorites: 54602
