    A joint team at NSC and OMB received a preliminary briefing today from the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), which is a statutory body of IG's. At the request of the NSC and in coordination with the Department of Defense and the Department of State, CIGIE is conducting a review of the operations of the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction, who has been in place since the close of the Bush Administration. We are committed to minimizing waste, fraud and abuse in our reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, and strong and effective IG operations in Afghanistan are important to those efforts. We appreciate the expertise and independence of CIGIE in evaluating the IG's operations in Afghanistan, and we look forward to receiving CIGIE's final report in a few weeks.
