    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to the Administration's FY 2004 budget submission for the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Justice, Labor, and Transportation; the Office of Personnel Management; and the Farm Credit Administration. I also ask the Congress to consider the enclosed proposals for the Department of the Interior and the Social Security Administration.
This transmittal also contains FY 2004 budget amendments for the Legislative Branch. Appropriations requests of the Legislative Branch are historically transmitted without change.
Further, in accordance with provisions of Public Law 108-11, the FY 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, I hereby request and make available $280.0 million for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with the Act, TSA would utilize these resources solely for expenses incurred to hire, train, and deploy initial passenger screeners.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
