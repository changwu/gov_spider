    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the 23rd Annual Report of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The report reviews the important role that arms control and the men and women of the Agency play in strengthening our country's national security.
The United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has primary responsibility for leading the Administration's efforts to reduce the world's nuclear arsenals, to negotiate a complete ban or reductions in chemical weapons, to reduce conventional forces in Europe, and to reinforce the barriers against war through confidence-building measures.
Soviet actions in the area of arms control in 1983 were a disappointment. We developed several sound positions, demonstrated our willingness to be flexible, and consistently invited the Soviets to walk through the door to serious negotiations. We hope that the Soviet Union will be willing to do this in 1984.
For its part, the United States will leave no stone unturned in its pursuit of reductions in nuclear arsenals. In 1984 we will renew our efforts to use the arms control process in ways that enhance our national security and improve global stability.
The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's 1983 report testifies to this Nation's continuing search for a peaceful and more stable world.
