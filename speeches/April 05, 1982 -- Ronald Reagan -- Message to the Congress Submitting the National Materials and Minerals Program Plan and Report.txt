    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit the National Materials and Minerals Program Plan and Report to Congress, pursuant to the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980.
This national minerals policy recognizes: • the critical role of minerals to our economy, national defense, and standard of living;
• the vast, unknown and untapped mineral wealth of America and the need to keep the public's land open to appropriate mineral exploration and development;
• the critical role of government in alerting the Nation to minerals issues and in ensuring that national decision-makers take into account the impact of their decisions on minerals policy; and, the need for long-term, high potential payoff research activity of wide generic application to improve and augment domestically available materials.
This policy is responsive to America's need for measures to diminish minerals vulnerability by allowing private enterprise to preserve and expand our minerals and materials economy.
