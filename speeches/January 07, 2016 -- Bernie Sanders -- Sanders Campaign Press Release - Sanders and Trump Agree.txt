    CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa â€“ Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Thursday commented on Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump's appearance in Burlington, Vermont, Sanders' hometown.
"Donald Trump and I finally agree on something. He wants to run against me. I want to run against him. It would be an extraordinary campaign and I am confident I would win," Sanders said as he arrived here for a four-day swing through Iowa.
"The American people will not support a candidate trying to divide us up by where we came from. They will not support a candidate who does not favor raising the minimum wage and who thinks wages in the country are too high. They will not support a candidate who thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. They will not support a candidate who wants to give huge tax breaks to billionaires like himself."
Sanders outperformed Trump 51 percent to 38 percent in a recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University.
