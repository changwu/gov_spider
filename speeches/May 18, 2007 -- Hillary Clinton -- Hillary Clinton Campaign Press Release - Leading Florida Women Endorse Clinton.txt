    Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of leading Florida women officials and community leaders today, illustrating her growing support in the Sunshine State.
"I am pleased to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States," said State Senator Arthenia Joyner. "She has a demonstrated commitment to working on the challenges facing families across America -- challenges like college affordability, access to health care, and the immediate crisis in skyrocketing gas prices."
West Palm Beach Mayor Lois Frankel said Clinton has a unique understanding of the needs of Floridians and their families. "I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton for President because I know her and admire her," Frankel said. "She's been one of Florida's great allies for more than a decade. Nobody understands Floridians, the challenges facing Florida, and the vital importance of Florida to our nation's success better than Hillary Clinton. She is the only candidate ready to lead the country now, without any on-the-job training."
