    The Radios made a significant contribution to the victory of freedom during the cold war. All friends of liberty appreciate the strong support of the German Government and in particular the Bavarian officials over the last four decades. With this move, the Radios begin a new chapter in the continuing struggle to consolidate democracy throughout the former Communist bloc. I am grateful to President Havel and the Czech Government for its generous offer and look forward to working with it to ensure the Radios' important work continues.
