    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to acceptance, an amendment to Article VI, paragraph A.1 of the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as amended. The amendment was recommended unanimously by the Board of Governors of the Agency on June 6, 1984, and approved by the Agency's General Conference on September 27, 1984. I also transmit the report of the Department of State on the amendment.
The amendment, if approved by twothirds of the members of the Agency, will increase from nine to ten the members of the Agency designated for a seat on the Board of Governors by virtue of their status as most advanced in the technology of atomic energy without regard to geographical distribution. This expansion will accommodate the entry of the People's Republic of China into the organization, which occurred on January 1, 1984. Under the amendment, the People's Republic of China will be able to occupy a seat on the Board of Governors without displacing any of the other designated members (currently these are Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, the USSR, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this matter, and give advice and consent to acceptance by the United States of the amendment to Article VI, paragraph A.1 of the Statute, as amended.
