    Less than a year ago, I signed Public Law 99-258, which extended the same statute of limitations as the act that I sign today extends an additional 2 years. I reluctantly sign S. 485, and I do not intend to sign another extension. This extension of the statute of limitations will maintain the status quo while the Congress completes development of a sound legislative solution to the complex and unique land management problems concerning submerged lands in Alaska. I strongly urge the 100th Congress to resolve these problems as soon as possible.
