    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 2017, the District of Columbia Emergency Highway Relief Act, a law to enable our Nation's capital city to advance critically needed highway construction projects. By temporarily waiving the District's cost-sharing requirements for these projects, this legislation assists the District during its period of fiscal crisis in a very practical and important way without imposing any additional cost on the American taxpayer.
Recognizing the importance of maintaining the District's highways for its residents, commuters from throughout the national capital area, and thousands of tourists from around the Nation and the world, this Administration initiated legislation to secure a similar temporary waiver for the District. With bipartisan and intergovernmental support, and through the dedicated efforts of members of the congressional delegation from this region, this legislation was expeditiously passed by both houses of Congress.
The District will be held accountable for the funds advanced for highway construction under this bill. The District is required to repay its share and must establish a dedicated highway fund to ensure it is able to make this repayment and to meet its matching share requirement in the future.
This legislation will enable the District to begin rebuilding its infrastructure almost immediately, as projects that were stalled for months due to a lack of funds can now quickly resume, creating many new jobs and safer streets for all who come to our Nation's capital.
