    Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris convened state legislators and advocates in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Vice President thanked the Nevada legislators for their leadership fighting on the frontlines for reproductive rights.
The Vice President emphasized that access to safe and legal reproductive health care is not a partisan issue. The state legislators and advocates discussed ways that they have safeguarded reproductive health care and abortion access in Nevada. They noted the prevalence of misinformation and disinformation surrounding reproductive health care and shared other challenges facing women in their state. They also discussed the unique impact of Dobbs on women service members and veterans. Vice President Harris expressed concern about how other rights may be at stake following Dobbs, including access to contraception and same sex marriage. The Vice President, state legislators, and advocates committed themselves to fighting to protect access to abortion.
The Vice President is bringing together leaders from across the nation who are on the frontlines fighting to protect a woman's right to make her own reproductive health decisions. As part of that work, the Vice President has recently met with state legislators from 17 states to discuss protecting reproductive rights, including Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. She has also convened health care providers, constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general, disability rights leaders, higher education leaders, and advocates.
