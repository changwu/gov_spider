    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Wednesday filed a report with the Federal Election Commission showing it raised nearly $46 million in March.
"Bernie's grassroots campaign has now out-raised Secretary Hillary Clinton for three months straight," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "We're honored to have the strong support of 2.2 million passionate donors who have given more than 7 million times. It's because of them that our campaign can take on the establishment and win eight of the last ten primaries and caucuses."
In March, Sanders' grassroots campaign received 1.7 million contributions from more than 900,000 individual donors. Sanders' campaign has now raised more than $200 million since he launched his campaign in April 2015, including more than $110 million in the first quarter of 2016.
The average contribution for the month was $26.20, just under the long-term average Sanders cites in his stump speech.
Unlike other candidates, Sanders' small-dollar donations allow him to run his primary campaign without the help of a Wall Street-funded super PAC. More than 96 percent of Sanders' money comes from donors who have not maxed-out to his primary campaign and can give again. In fact, only 127 donors maxed-out to the campaign in March.
Sanders' campaign reported more than $17 million cash on hand.
