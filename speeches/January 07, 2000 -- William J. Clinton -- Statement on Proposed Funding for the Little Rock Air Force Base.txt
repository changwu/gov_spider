    I am pleased to announce today that my budget for next year will include $30 million for a C-130J flight training simulator at the Little Rock Air Force Base. The Little Rock Air Force Base, the preeminent training location for C-130's, has long served a highly significant role in our Nation's system of national defense.
In fiscal year 2002 my budget provides $10 million for a facility to house this simulator. I am also calling for upgrades to the existing simulators—one each in fiscal year 2001, fiscal year 2002, and fiscal year 2003—for a total of over $12 million. Also, due to the strong efforts of Representative Snyder, we will also fund over $9 million for a much-needed fitness facility at the base.
Finally, my budget will call for four C-130J's, two for the Air Force and two for the Marines.
I believe the simulators, the associated facilities, and the planes I am announcing today will support the Little Rock Air Force Base as it continues to serve the vital function of training our Nation's pilots, and will ensure a strong C-130 fleet, continuing its vital role in protecting U.S. national interests.
I want to specifically thank Senator Blanche Lincoln and Representative Vic Snyder for their tireless efforts on behalf of the base. Without their attention to every detail of this program, I would not be making this announcement today. I look forward to working with Congress to ensure that these important components are fully funded in next year's budget.
