Quad-City Times
The U.S. faces serious challenges. Our national debt must be dealt with. ISIS is an evil that must be destroyed; otherwise thousands will continue to be murdered. Adversaries such as Russia will continue to bully America to advance policies that harm us. The federal government is a bureaucratic embarrassment with no accountability. Millions of our citizens feel they have no chance and are trapped in generational poverty.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich stands out as the most capable candidate to deal with these enormous challenges. He was one of the architects of balancing federal budget in the 1990s, and led Ohio from an $8 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus. Gov. Kasich is passionate about helping the most vulnerable Americans; his record of welfare reform, tax cuts for low-income Ohioans, and expanding treatment and housing to individuals with mental illness, show he is a man of compassion. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years, Kasich made sure the military was prepared to defend the U.S. Throughout the 1980s, Kasich was a strong ally of President Reagan and his national security agenda, and understands "Peace through Strength."
I encourage all Iowans to thoroughly research each candidate and not base their vote on Twitter, political pundits or the media. In comparison to the other candidates, Kasich provides the most comprehensive record of fiscal discipline and plan to destroy ISIS. Mr. Kasich is a proven leader and demonstrated such with his accomplishments as governor of Ohio.
