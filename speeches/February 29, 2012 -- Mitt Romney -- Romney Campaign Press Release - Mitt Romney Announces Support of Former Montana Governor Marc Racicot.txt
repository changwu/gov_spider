    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Montana Governor Marc Racicot.
"I'm honored to have the endorsement of a man who has spent so much time in the service of this country," said Mitt Romney. "First as an officer in the Army JAG Corps, then as a state prosecutor, and finally as the Governor of Montana, Governor Racicot knows what sort of leadership we need to restore American greatness and bring this country back to where it belongs."
Announcing his support, Governor Racicot said, "The people of Montana and a clear majority of the people of this country have been seriously and adversely impacted by the perilous circumstances confronting this nation. A prolonged combination of crippling debt, unbridled government spending and a stagnant economy imposes more damage and destruction on Montana and American families every day.  We need a president with a clear plan to move with the urgency required to bring down the federal deficit while encouraging economic growth and prosperity.  Mitt Romney will be that president, and that's why he has my support.  I urge my fellow Montanans and fellow citizens across the country to join me."
