    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Senators Hecht (R) and Laxalt (R) Nevada)
While the Administration supports S. 2506 as passed by the Senate, which would establish a 44,000-acre Great Basin National Park in Nevada, it opposes the bill as reported by the House Interior Committee, which establishes a 109,000-acre park. The additional acreage is currently part of the National Forest System, managed for multiple uses, including recreation, wildlife habitat, hunting, grazing, mineral development, and timber production. Except for recreation, wildlife habitat and grazing, these uses must be discontinued if the entire area is designated as a National Park, resulting in substantial economic losses for the neighboring communities. These losses would outweigh any economic benefit to the localities associated with increased tourism resulting from park designation.
