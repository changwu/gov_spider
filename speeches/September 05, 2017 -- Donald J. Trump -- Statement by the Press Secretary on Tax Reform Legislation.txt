    This afternoon, key leaders from Congress and the Administration had a productive meeting at the White House with President Donald J. Trump to discuss the priority of enacting historic tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, and pro-America. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to reducing the crushing burden of the Nation's self-destructive tax code, which hurts our companies and our workers, and discussed their desire to make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand. They discussed House and Senate committee hearings on tax reform and agreed that committee activity should continue so that Congress can move to mark-ups on legislation as expeditiously as possible. President Trump expressed his resolve to encourage action and build public support for the passage of tax reform that creates jobs and raises wages for American workers. The leaders also discussed the critical need for funding to support the Hurricane Harvey rebuilding and recovery efforts in Texas and Louisiana.
