    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(McCurdy (D) OK)
H.R. 1455, as reported by the House Select Intelligence Committee, increases direct spending without sufficient offsets. The Administration would have no objection to House passage of H.R. 1455, provided it contains offsets as required by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990. The bill eliminates the principal features (title VI) that were the basis of the President's veto of similar legislation (S. 2834) in the 101st Congress. The Administration, however, continues to be concerned that the classified annex to the Committee report raises constitutional concerns under the Presentment Clause of the Constitution and the INS v. Chadha decision. Specifically, the classified annex purports to require prior congressional committee approval of specified Executive activities.
Scoring for the Purpose of PAYGO and Discretionary Caps
H.R. 1455 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). No offsets to the direct spending increases are provided in the bill. A budget point of order applies in the Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If, contrary to the Administration's recommendation, the Senate waives any such point of order that applies against H.R. 1455, the effects of enactment of this legislation would be included in the look back pay-as-you-go sequester report at the end of the Congressional session.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 1455 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
