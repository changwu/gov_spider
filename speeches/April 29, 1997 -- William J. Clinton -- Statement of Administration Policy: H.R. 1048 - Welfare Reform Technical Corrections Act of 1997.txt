    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Reps. Shaw (R) FL and Levin (D) MI)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1048, which will help ensure the effective implementation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.
Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 1048 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's scoring estimate of the bill is under development.
