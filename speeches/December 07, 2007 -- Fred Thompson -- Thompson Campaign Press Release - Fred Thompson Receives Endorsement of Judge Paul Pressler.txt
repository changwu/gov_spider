McLean, VA-Today former Texas Court of Appeals Judge Paul Pressler endorsed Fred Thompson for President.
"Fred Thompson has the experience, convictions and dedication to make him a great candidate and a great President," said Judge Pressler. "He knows Washington but is not part of the Washington system. Fred is the consistent conservative in the presidential race and is the most electable."
Judge Paul Pressler is a graduate of Princeton University and the University of Texas Law School. He was a Texas state legislator and went on to serve as a District Judge from 1970 to 1978. Judge Pressler was appointed Justice of the Texas Court of Appeals in 1978 and served until 1992. He has since retired but maintains an active international private practice. As a young attorney and family man, Judge Pressler was deeply concerned over the theological drift he saw in the Southern Baptist Convention. He was one of the two chief architects of the "Conservative Resurgence" of the SBC in the late '70s and early '80s. Because of his tireless efforts, he is revered among Southern Baptists as a warrior and hero.
"I am deeply grateful to receive the endorsement of Judge Paul Pressler. Judge Pressler is a leader of great integrity," said Senator Thompson. "His service in the legislative and judicial branches of government provides him a unique perspective on the role of the Presidency. In his private life, he has been a stalwart conservative leader in the Southern Baptist Convention and is deeply respected and influential. I appreciate his confidence in me, my consistent record, and my plans for our country."
