Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!Retweets: 30199Favorites: 125633

Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI 'SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT.' Andrew McCarthy says 'There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.' If so this is bigger than Watergate!Retweets: 8933Favorites: 27591

Despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and 'Haters' but that's the way it is!Retweets: 32409Favorites: 137132

Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE ' Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day!Retweets: 19148Favorites: 80528
