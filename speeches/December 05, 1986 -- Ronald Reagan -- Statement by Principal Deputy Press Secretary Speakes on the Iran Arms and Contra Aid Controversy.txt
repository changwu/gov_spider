    The President met this afternoon with the bipartisan leadership of Congress. The President said he would consider the recommendations of Senator Dole and others for a special session of Congress and was reserving judgment at this time. The President told the leaders that it was important to expedite and consolidate the number of congressional inquiries being planned. He stressed his commitment to cooperate with the Congress in the conduct of its investigation and to get all the facts so that the issue could be put to rest. The congressional leaders discussed with the President their respective plans for how they intend to organize their investigative committees. The meeting concluded with a brief discussion on the presentation of the fiscal year 1988 budget and other matters to be considered in the initial weeks of the 100th Congress.
