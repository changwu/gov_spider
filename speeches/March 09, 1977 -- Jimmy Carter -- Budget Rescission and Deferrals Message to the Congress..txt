    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I am withdrawing one previously proposed rescission and reporting revisions to three deferrals previously transmitted.
The withdrawal is for the business loan and investment fund of the Small Business Administration. Two of the revised deferrals are increases which relate to programs in the Department of Defense while the third reflects a decrease in a Department of Transportation deferral. The combined effect of these revisions is to increase the amount deferred by $27.7 million.
The details of the rescission withdrawal and each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
