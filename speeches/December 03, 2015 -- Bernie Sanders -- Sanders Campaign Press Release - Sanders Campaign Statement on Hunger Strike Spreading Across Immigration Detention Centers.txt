    BURLINGTON, Vt. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' Latino outreach director Arturo Carmona issued the following statement Thursday in support of a nationwide hunger strike against inhumane conditions in immigration detention facilities:
"Sen. Sanders is committed to a humane and secure immigration policy, which includes ensuring that people escaping violence and severe poverty are given a fair opportunity to present their claims. These aspiring Americans should not be criminalized, subjected to dehumanizing solitary confinement or indefinitely detained. The United States must meet our international responsibilities to families seeking refuge. Sen. Sanders' immigration platform promotes alternatives to detention, closes private prisons and would allow thousands of non-violent immigrant detainees to reunite with their families as they wait for their day in court."
