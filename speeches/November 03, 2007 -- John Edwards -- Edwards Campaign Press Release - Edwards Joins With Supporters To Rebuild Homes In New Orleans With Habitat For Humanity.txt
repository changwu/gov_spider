    As part of "American Heroes Week," Edwards honors the people of New Orleans and their dedication to rebuilding the city
New Orleans, Louisiana â€“ Today, as part of "American Heroes Week," Senator John Edwards traveled to Louisiana to honor the people of New Orleans who have shown great determination and commitment to rebuilding their city. Edwards was joined by supporters and other Habitat for Humanity volunteers in New Orleans' Upper 9th Ward for a day of rebuilding the area devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
"While President Bush continues to fail New Orleans, the American people and the residents of the city have not. Almost all of the progress that's been made has been the work of the proud residents of the city and generous Americans, working without and often in spite of the federal government. These determined and courageous people are the real American heroes. Their perseverance should serve as an example to all of us of what is possible when we come together to build the America we believe in."
Edwards and his supporters joined other Habitat for Humanity volunteers in a build at the area known as "The Musicians' Village." A project of New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity (NOAHH) conceived by award-winning musicians and New Orleans' natives Harry Connick, Jr. and Branford Marsalis, The Musicians' Village concept consists of 72 single-family, Habitat-constructed homes for displaced New Orleans musicians and other qualifying Habitat partner families. Its centerpiece is the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music, dedicated to the education and development of homeowners and others who live nearby.
In September, the campaign launched the "Build with John" online contest, keeping with Edwards' promise to create big, bold change on the issues that matter by giving supporters the chance to work alongside Edwards in an effort he cares deeply about - rebuilding New Orleans. Five supporters were chosen randomly from thousands who entered the contest via the campaign website. They are:

Details of Edwards' proposals to promote post-Katrina recovery are included below.

An Eight-Point Plan for Getting New Orleans Back on its Feet
To promote further post-Katrina recovery efforts in New Orleans, Edwards has proposed eight steps to restore safety, rebuild the infrastructure, create jobs, and hold contractors and government officials accountable for progress.
Addressing the nursing shortage and supporting the proposed biomedical corridor
Edwards will invest in nursing school capacity, offer up to full scholarships for nurses who commit to working in New Orleans and improve working conditions to keep nurses from leaving and to bring more back. Expanding nursing education programs will ensure access to health care while helping fuel development of the proposed biomedical corridor.
Create good jobs to bring residents home
Displaced New Orleans residents will not return unless there are good jobs to return to. Edwards will make sure the jobs of rebuilding New Orleans carry good, local prevailing wages. He has proposed hiring 50,000 Gulf Coast residents to fill stepping stone jobs dedicated to civic works - rebuilding infrastructure that will help local and returning residents gain skills and experience.
Providing new resources to make the city's streets safe
Edwards will provide funding federal funding for 500 new officers, and help the local law enforcement recruit returning skilled Iraqi veterans. Edwards will pay for the new law enforcement initiatives with an aggressive prosecution initiative to recover money from private contractors that used crony connections to secure Katrina/Rita recovery contracts and then ripped off taxpayers.
Protecting the Gulf from future storms
We are in the second hurricane season after Katrina and New Orleans' levee system is still not where it needs to be to protect the city from another major hurricane. Making matters worse, the president recently vetoed the Water Resources Development Act, which would fund flood protection and coastal restoration projects in the Gulf. As president, Edwards will do whatever is necessary to ensure that Katrina never happens again. That means stronger levees and the restoration of coastal wetlands, which are a natural barrier for storm surges.
Fully funding the "Road Home"
Edwards is calling on Congress and the president to keep their promises to people of the Gulf to "do what it takes" by helping make up the $3 billion difference. A fully-funded Road Home would help rebuild the region by bringing back residents and creating good renovation and home repair jobs. With the program running out of money by early next year, the time to act is now.
Providing affordable housing connected to opportunity
We must both provide affordable housing and end the old racial and economic isolation of pre-Katrina New Orleans. Edwards supports the construction of affordable rental and owner-occupied housing in economically integrated housing close to transportation, good schools and good jobs.
Putting someone in charge
Edwards will appoint a Chief Recovery Officer to channel presidential leadership, ensure accountability, cut red tape and deliver results for the people of the Gulf Coast.
Passing "Brownie's Law," so agencies like FEMA get the job done
Edwards will enact a new requirement - "Brownie's Law" - ensuring that senior political appointees actually are qualified to perform the job to which they are appointed. Brownie's Law will require that heads of executive agencies and other senior officials have demonstrated qualifications in the field related to their job.
