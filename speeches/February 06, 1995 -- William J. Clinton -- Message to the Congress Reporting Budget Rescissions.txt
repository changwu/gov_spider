    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 23 rescission proposals of budgetary resources, totaling $1.1 billion. These rescissions, when combined with other discretionary savings proposals contained in the FY 1996 Budget, will reduce FY 1995 budgetary resources by $2.4 billion.
The proposed rescissions affect the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Small Business Administration; the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board; and the National Science Foundation.
