    Q. Mr. President, the Democrats say the Republicans are stonewalling the budget process. They won't participate. Are the Republicans refusing to participate in the budget process?
The President. Sam [Sam Donaldson, ABC News], the Republicans, for all the 6 years that I've been here, every year, have offered a sound, solid budget; and the Democrats come back with a continuing resolution. And they haven't given us a budget yet.
Q. Will there be one this year, or will there be a continuing resolution this year? Will you get one this year, or will it be another continuing resolution?
The President. I'm still trying. It's a good budget. It meets the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings terms. And the Democrats have refused to present a budget of their own.
Q. They want taxes, new taxes.
The President. I know. They're not going to get those either. Nice talking to you.
Q. Thanks a lot.
Q. If I could think of a question on Iranâ€”I can't think of one. [Laughter]
