    Economic Program
Q. Mr. President, speaking of construction, should Lani Guinier withdraw?
The President. I'll have more to say about that later. But this is the most important thing I'm working on. This is the illustration of why the economic program is important. Housing sales at a 7-month high last month, creating jobs for people like this because of low mortgage rates. If we can keep the interest rates down by passing the economic program, getting the deficit down, you're going to see a lot more jobs, a Lot more homes, a lot of money putting into this economy. That's the real important thing that this administration was elected to do and that's what I'm working on.
