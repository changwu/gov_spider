    Michigan Congressman Mike Rogers today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"American intelligence professionals around the world need to have a clear mission, clear authorities and strong support from the policy makers they serve.  But if we don't know who we are or why we are engaged around the world, it creates confusion for our brave intelligence professionals conducting dangerous missions in dangerous places. Lives have been put in jeopardy because the Obama Administration cannot keep a secret. Intentional leaks coming out of this Administration also are intended to undermine our allies' ability to protect themselves. This is not how you treat our friends.  A President Romney will restore the time-tested model of rewarding loyalty to the United States with loyalty from the United States."
