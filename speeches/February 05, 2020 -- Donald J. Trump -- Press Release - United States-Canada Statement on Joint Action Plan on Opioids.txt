On January 31, 2020, officials of the governments of the United States and Canada convened in Washington, D.C. at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy to move forward with a bilateral initiative to find solutions to the opioid crisis affecting both nations.
When President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met on June 20, 2019, the leaders emphasized their shared concern for the increase in opioid-related deaths on both sides of the border. The United States and Canada agreed they would work more closely together to find solutions to the opioid crisis by developing a joint action plan. The two countries will boost their collaboration to combat opioids trafficking, including fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, and address the health consequences of problematic opioid use through public health, law enforcement and border security cooperation, as well as share information and best practices. The United States and Canada have been working together to determine key areas of focus requiring additional cooperation. The two countries also cooperate on opioid-related work in the G7 and through the North American Drug Dialogue, which most recently met in December 2019.
At the January 31, 2020 meeting, the steering committee of the Joint Action Plan on Opioids moved forward with a framework and established working groups aimed to enhance current bilateral exchanges and engagements and to find new solutions to several key law enforcement, border security, and health challenges facing both countries.
