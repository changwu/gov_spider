    Barbara and I are saddened by the death of Friedrich August von Hayek. I presented him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 because he was one of the great thinkers of our age who explored the promise and contours of liberty.
Professor von Hayek revolutionized the world's intellectual and political life. Future generations will read and benefit from his works.
