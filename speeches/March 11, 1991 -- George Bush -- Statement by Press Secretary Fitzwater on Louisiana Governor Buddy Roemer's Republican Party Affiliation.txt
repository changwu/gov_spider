    The President today welcomed Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer's announcement that he has switched his party affiliation from the Democrat Party to the Republican Party. The President looks forward to working closely with Governor Roemer as the most recent addition to the ranks of Republican Governors.
As Governor Roemer stated, "The reason is simple. After more than 10 years of public service, it has been my observation and increasing conviction that it is the Republican Party that is becoming most open to new ideas, new thinking, new people, most open to team building, to opportunity building."
Governor Roemer, a former four-term Congressman, was elected Governor in 1987 and is the first sitting Governor to switch parties in modern history. This follows a number of Democrat officeholders, more than 200, who have switched their affiliations in the past 2 years.
Governor Roemer telephoned the President last week to discuss his decision to switch party affiliations. The President has invited the Governor to come to the White House on Monday, March 18, 1991.
