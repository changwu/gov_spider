    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send you the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1985. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and information sciences; engineering; and education in those fields.
Achievements such as those described in this report are the basis for much of our Nation's strengthâ€”its economic growth, military security, and the overall well-being of our people.
We face challenges in science, engineering, and technology, but I am confident about our ability to meet those challenges. The National Science Foundation has been and will remain a key part of the national effort to expand our research achievements and productivity and to remain competitive in world markets through innovation and new discoveries.
I commend the Foundation's work to you.
