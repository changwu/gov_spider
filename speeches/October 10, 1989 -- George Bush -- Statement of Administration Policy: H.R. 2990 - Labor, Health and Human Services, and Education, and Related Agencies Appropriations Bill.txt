    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsors:	Whitten (D), Mississippi; Natcher (D), Kentucky; Byrd (D), West Virginia; Harkin (D), Iowa)
The Committee on Conference on H.R. 2990 has reported the FY 1990 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. The President's senior advisors would recommend that the President sign this bill provided it does not contain the Senate language in section 204 concerning abortion.
The Administration finds unacceptable the Senate's attempt to expand Federal funding for abortion beyond cases where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. In a letter dated August 2, 1989, regarding the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, the President stated that he would veto a bill with language permitting use of appropriated funds for abortions other than those where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.
The House is urged to insist on its position so that the President can be presented a bill that he can sign.
