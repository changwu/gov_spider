Gov. John Kasich says no to Syrian refugees
Gov. John Kasich on Monday said Ohio should not accept any new Syrian refugees amid concerns terrorists might sneak into the country posing as refugees.
"The governor doesn't believe the U.S. should accept additional Syrian refugees because security and safety issues cannot be adequately addressed," Kasich spokesman Jim Lynch said in a statement. "The governor is writing to the President to ask him to stop, and to ask him to stop resettling them in Ohio. We are also looking at what additional steps Ohio can take to stop resettlement of these refugees."
