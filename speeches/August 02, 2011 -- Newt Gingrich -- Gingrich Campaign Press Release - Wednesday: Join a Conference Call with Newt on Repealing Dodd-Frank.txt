    Newt believes that creating jobs and restoring economic growth requires the complete repeal of Dodd-Frank. This conference call is for Newt to have a conversation with people whose industries have been affected by Dodd-Frank, and learn about their experiences, answer their questions, and begin a dialogue so that together we can repeal this job-killing law.
