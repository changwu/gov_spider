    To Mother Teresa of Calcutta
I would like to express my personal congratulations for your richly deserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1979.
Your work on behalf of children, refugees, the poor and the sick has been a great inspiration for many years to those of us who cherish and espouse human rights. Mankind is in your debt for your fine contributions and for the example you have provided of selfless concern for others.
I wish you every continuing success in your service to humanity.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
