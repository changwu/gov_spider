    THE NATIONAL Wage Stabilization Board will continue to administer the wage stabilization program.
I asked the Advisory Board of OWMR this week to add to its agenda a study of the wage stabilization program. This Board has been studying problems of Government expenditures, the shortage of certain materials, and the over-all inflationary problem. The Advisory Board will, of course, consult in detail with the Wage Stabilization Board on this new topic as it has been doing from time to time in the past. The Advisory Board, as the name implies, is not an administrative agency. It was established by the Congress to advise the President and the Director of OWMR on broad problems of national reconversion policy.
