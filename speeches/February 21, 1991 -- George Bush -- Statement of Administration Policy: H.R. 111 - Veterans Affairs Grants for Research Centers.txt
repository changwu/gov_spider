    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 2/22)(House)(Edwards (D) TX and 3 others)
The Administration strongly supports medical research. The National Institutes of Health alone awards over $4 billion annually in grunts to medical schools and universities for research. This research includes the types of research specified in H.R. 111. In light of this substantial commitment, the lack of any clear benefit to any Department of Veterans Affairs mission from the research, and the many competing priorities for Federal research support, the Administration opposes H.R. 111.
H.R. 111 would create a new grant program, authorizing $50 million for each of FYs 1992 through 1995, to establish new medical research centers at certain State medical schools. New State research centers are not a priority for Federal research assistance. H.R. Ill would also cause the Department of Defense to divert research funds from higher priority defense bio-medical research projects.
