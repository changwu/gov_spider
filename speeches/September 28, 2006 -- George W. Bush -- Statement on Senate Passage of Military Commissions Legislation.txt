    Today the Senate sent a strong signal to the terrorists that we will continue using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks on America. The "Military Commissions Act of 2006" will allow the continuation of a CIA program that has been one of America's most potent tools in fighting the war on terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.
Our most solemn responsibility is protecting America's security, and I thank the Senate for passing this vital legislation.
