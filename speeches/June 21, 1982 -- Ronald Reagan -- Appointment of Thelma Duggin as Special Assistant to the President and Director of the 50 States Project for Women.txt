    The President today announced the appointment of Thelma Duggin as Special Assistant to the President and Director of the 50 States Project for Women. Ms. Duggin will continue to serve in the White House Office of Public Liaison under the direction of Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Assistant to the President for Public Liaison.
The 50 States Project reflects President Reagan's campaign commitment with the 50 Governors in an effort to identify and correct State laws which discriminate against women. The groundwork for the program was begun in May 1981 with a Presidential letter to the Governors seeking their assistance in identifying and correcting discriminatory State laws. In October 1981, the Governors' representatives met at the White House to exchange information and promote cooperation between the States. In her new capacity, Ms. Duggin will work to carry out the project in all 50 States.
Since April of 1981, Ms. Duggin has been serving as Deputy Special Assistant in the Office of Public Liaison. Her responsibilities include outreach to the black community and youth organizations. Before joining the White House staff, she served as a field coordinator with Wright McNeill and Associates, which directed the Black Community Involvement program for the Republican National Committee.
Ms. Duggin, 32, is a native of Mobile, Ala., and holds a degree in education from Edgewood College in Madison, Wis.
