    To the Congress of the United States:
As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the Congress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and Engineering Indicators—1998. This report represents the thirteenth in a series examining key aspects of the status of American science and engineering in a global environment.
Investments in science and engineering research and education have enjoyed bipartisan support. They are critical to America's ability to maintain world leadership and fulfill our potential as a Nation as we begin the transition into the 21st century.
This report provides a broad base of quantitative information about U.S. science, engineering, and technology in an international context. I commend Science and Engineering Indicators—1998 to the attention of the Congress and those in the scientific and technology communities. It will assist us in better understanding the new developments and trends in what is rapidly becoming a global knowledge-based economy.
