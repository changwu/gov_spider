    St. Patrick's Day brings out all of the innate warmth, goodness and joy of living that Irish people have brought to this land. It joins us all in celebration of a legacy that is a vital part of our national character and way of life.
Rosalynn and I welcome this annual opportunity to greet our fellow citizens of Irish ancestry and to share in the sentiments of countless others who become Irish on this special day.
