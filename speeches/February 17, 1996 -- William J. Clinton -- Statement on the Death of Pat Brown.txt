    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of Gov. Pat Brown's death.
I am very grateful for the warm friendship and wise counsel he generously extended to me and for what he meant to America.
More than any other individual, he built modern California, with its great universities, highways, and vital water system.
He loved people, and he loved politics. Always positive and optimistic, he believed in the promise of America, and he brought out the best in people, because they knew he was committed to their future.
He was blessed with a wonderful wife and five children, who carried on his traditions of public service. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bernice, Jerry, Kathleen, Barbara, and Cynthia, and Pat Brown's grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. May his great heart and good spirit be with them always.
