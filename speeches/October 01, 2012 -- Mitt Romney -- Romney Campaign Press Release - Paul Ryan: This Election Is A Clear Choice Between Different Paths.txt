PAUL RYAN: "We're entering what we call the debate and choice phase of this campaign. And we're going to give the people of this country the right and opportunity to choose a different path. We're offering very specific pro-growth plans to get us a dynamic pro-growth economy that fosters opportunity versus four more years of the same which means a stagnant economy that fosters government dependency. You stick with the President's path or you choose the better future. Stagnation versus growth. Dependency versus upward mobility and opportunity."
