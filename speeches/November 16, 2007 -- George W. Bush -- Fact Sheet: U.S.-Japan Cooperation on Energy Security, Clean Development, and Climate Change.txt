    President George W. Bush of the United States of America and Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda of Japan met on November 16, 2007, in Washington, D.C.
The Two Leaders Reaffirmed That Japan And The United States Would Continue Close Cooperation And Coordination In Addressing Energy Security, Clean Development, And Climate Change
The United States and Japan will work closely together:



    To make the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Bali in December a success and establish a "Bali Roadmap" that will advance formal negotiations on an effective post-2012 framework.



    To ensure, in connection with the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit in Japan next year (July 7-9, 2008), that members fulfill their G8 commitments on climate change and energy security, and to cooperate to make tangible progress toward the establishment of an effective framework on climate change beyond 2012 under the UNFCCC.


    To advance the Major Economies Process leading up to a leaders meeting in 2008 that concludes with a detailed contribution to a global agreement under the UNFCCC by 2009, pursuing an agreement that is based on commitments by all major economies to take action, allows for flexibility and diversity of approaches, and is environmentally effective and economically sustainable.


    To focus major economies' discussions of a future global framework on key elements, including:

A long-term global goal for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, consistent with economic development objectives;


National plans that set mid-term goals to advance the global goal, with each country selecting its own mix of binding, market-based, and voluntary measures that are environmentally effective and measurable;


Collaborative technology development and deployment strategies for key sectors, including low-carbon fossil power generation, transportation, land use, near-zero carbon energy (e.g., nuclear, wind, and solar), and energy efficiency -advanced by international sector-based discussion;


Financing mechanisms to support adoption of cleaner, more efficient technologies, along with the reduction and elimination of trade barriers for clean energy goods and services;


Improved measurement and accounting systems to track progress; and


Robust programs on forestry, adaptation, and technology access for all UN members.




    To highlight the value for a future global framework of a sector-based approach and public-private cooperation, as demonstrated successfully in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP).


    To continue our leading role in research and development of clean energy and climate technologies and encourage other major economies to increase public funding, as the United States and Japan have, for research and development of clean energy and climate technologies in order to promote the commercialization and adoption of such technologies, increase energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while strengthening energy security and economic growth.

To further enhance cooperation in the field of nuclear energy under the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership and the U.S.-Japan Joint Nuclear Energy Action Plan, in light of a growing interest in nuclear energy in the Asia-Pacific region, to provide a clean power generating option without greenhouse gases in a manner ensuring nuclear non-proliferation, safety, and security.
