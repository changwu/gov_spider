    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am pleased to forward the enclosed report on the Federal agencies' implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a). The report covers calendar years 1990 and 1991.
In addition to the data required to be reported by the statute, the report also describes agencies' efforts in training their employees to carry out the provisions of the Privacy Act responsibly and reliably.
While agencies continue to meet their responsibilities under the Act, they are becoming increasingly concerned about how the Act's provisions will work in a computerized environment. A challenge for the years ahead will be to harmonize the provisions of the Privacy Act with the technologies that are now coming into play.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
