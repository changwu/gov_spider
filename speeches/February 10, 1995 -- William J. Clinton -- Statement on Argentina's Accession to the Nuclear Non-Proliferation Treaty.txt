    I warmly welcome Argentina's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) this morning. In joining the NPT, Argentina has taken an historic step to reinforce its own security and to unite with 170 other NPT parties in the global effort to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. I salute President Menem and his government for their foresight and courage in making Argentina a champion for nonproliferation in Latin America and around the world. In the State of the Union Address, I pledged that the United States would lead the charge for indefinite extension of the NPT when the treaty's future is considered this April. Argentina's NPT adherence will help us reach that goal.
