    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1659, because it is unnecessary and establishes a costly precedent for Federal funding.
The bill creates automatic new spending not subject to the appropriations process and not in keeping with the FY 1990 Budget Resolution. It would thus increase the deficit by up to $100 million in outlays and hinder efforts to avoid a sequester.
Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has already required the installation of explosives detection systems, such as Thermal Neutron Analysis-type equipment. The airlines are fully capable of bearing the costs of this equipment, either through the existing security surcharge approach or through negligible increases in ticket prices. H.R. 1659 would transfer these costs to the Federal Government, thereby increasing the deficit by $100 million in FY 1990.
The Federal Government's traditional role is to perform the research and development necessary to achieve security improvements and then transfer the technology to the private sector. The taxpayer has already committed approximately $56 million to research and development in explosives detection technology over the past 8 years. Forcing the FAA to purchase the units will also slow their deployment by requiring acquisition through the Government's lengthy procurement process.
The Administration also opposes provisions in H.R. 1659 that would: (l) impose security measures on foreign carriers that are unnecessary or counterproductive; (2) interfere with the FAA's enforcement program by exempting airport operators from accountability for total airport security; and (3) require statutorily the screening of passengers and baggage on commuter airlines.
