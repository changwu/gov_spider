    Today, Biden for President announced 19 new endorsements from current and former elected officials across the state of Ohio â€“ a state often called "the mother of presidents" and a critical swing state in this election.
"As an Ohio native, I'm thrilled to announce a great group of Buckeye endorsements ahead of next week's debate in Westerville. Ohio is crucial to this election, and this campaign will never take it for granted. The legislators and leaders joining us today will not only deepen our broad, diverse coalition, they represent the America we're fighting for," said Greg Schultz, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "It says a lot, and means a lot to have these trusted public servants's support. Together, we'll keep building the strong, grassroots momentum to move this campaign and this country forward."
