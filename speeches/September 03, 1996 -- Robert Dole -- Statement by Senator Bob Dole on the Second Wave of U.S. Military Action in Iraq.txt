    Today, Bob Dole released the following statement from Des Moines, Iowa on U.S. military action in Iraq:
"As stated earlier today, I support the men and women of our armed forces as they continue their assignment in Iraq. From news accounts, this appears to be a part of the same military operation that began yesterday and involved returning to some of the same sites originally targeted. We must await further information to determine not only the success of this action in a military sense, but its success in accomplish the larger goals the United States must achieve in Iraq: the withdrawal of Saddam's troops in Northern Iraq; the release of Kurdish prisoners; a halt to interference by both Iraq and Iran among the Kurds; the re-establishment of the U.N. weapons inspection effort; and an end to Saddam's support of international terrorism."
