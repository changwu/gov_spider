    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kasich (R) OH and Sikorski (D) MN)
The Administration opposes H.R. 49. 83 because it is unnecessary in light of the current Federal employees incentive awards program, which is working very well. In particular, the special temporary program for awards by Inspectors Generals (IGs) should not be made permanent. This program has seldom been used, and IGs can recommend awards under the regular incentive awards program. Moreover, the proposed authority for IGs to grant awards to former employees and certain non-Federal employees is an undesirable departure from the current practice of giving these awards only to current Government employees.
Further, the bill would increase significantly the maximum amount for IG and incentive awards. For example, non-Presidential incentive awards, which are currently capped at $25,000, would be increased to as much as double the GS-18 pay level, or more than $156, 000 at current pay levels. This increase is excessive, particularly given the lack of evidence that such an increase is needed.
