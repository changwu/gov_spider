    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Davis (R) VA and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration supports H.R. 858, which would extend coverage under the whistleblower protection provisions of the District of Columbia Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 to personnel of the courts of the District of Columbia. The change would protect these employees from losing their jobs or otherwise being penalized for disclosing violations of the law or misuse of government funds or resources. Similar protection is already provided to most District employees.
