    I welcome Japan's announcement that it will provide $1.5 billion toward immediate reconstruction needs in Iraq. I applaud this bold step, which will help mobilize international support for efforts to build a stable, peaceful, and democratic Iraq. Japan recognizes that this effort is critical to security and peace not only in Iraq and the Middle East but also for Japan and throughout the world. Japan's own history shows the power of international cooperation to help a great people build democracy and prosperity and become a beacon of freedom that inspires all nations.
I also commend Japan's announcement that it is working on a larger aid package in preparation for the October 23-24 Madrid Donor's Conference. We look forward to working with Japan and other countries to make the Madrid Conference a success for the people of Iraq.
