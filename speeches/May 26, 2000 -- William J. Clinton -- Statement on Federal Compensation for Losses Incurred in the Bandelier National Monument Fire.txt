    This administration is committed to ensuring that all those who have been affected by the fire that began at Bandelier National * Monument are fully compensated for their losses. At this time, we are working with the New Mexico delegation to craft legislation that would govern Federal compensation and make available the funds needed to pay for this legislation. We are committed to working with the Congress to ensure that this matter is addressed as promptly as possible.
