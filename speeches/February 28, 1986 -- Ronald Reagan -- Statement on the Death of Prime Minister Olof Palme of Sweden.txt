    I have learned with great shock of the tragic death of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. My sorrow in the face of this senseless act of violence is profound. Olof Palme was one of the world's most respected leaders, a man who made compassion the hallmark of Swedish policy. The world will remember him for his devotion to democratic values and his untiring efforts to promote peace. I offer my most sincere condolences to the family of Prime Minister Palme and to the Swedish people in their hour of grief. I also pray for the speedy recovery of Mrs. Palme.
