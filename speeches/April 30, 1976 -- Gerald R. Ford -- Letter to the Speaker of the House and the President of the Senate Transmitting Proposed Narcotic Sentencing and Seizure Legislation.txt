    THERE IS transmitted herewith a bill containing the Administration's proposals for increasing the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in protecting the American people from trafficking in heroin and other narcotic drugs.
This legislation, which implements the recommendations contained in my special message to the Congress on drug abuse, would, if enacted, improve our ability to put the traffickers of hard drugs into prison. It would also improve our ability to take the easy profits out of drug trafficking as well as our capacity to detect and apprehend drug smugglers.
Considering the terrible toll that narcotic addiction takes, it is a matter of high priority that our laws be made more effective in curbing the narcotic traffic. If the law does not act as a deterrent, the risk of arrest and seizures becomes merely a cost of doing business for the narcotic traffickers. Unless there exists a reasonable certainty of punishment after conviction, traffickers have little reason to get out of the trafficking business. I therefore respectfully urge that these proposals receive consideration this session.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
