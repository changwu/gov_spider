    It was with regret that I received today Judge Douglas Ginsburg's decision to withdraw his name from further consideration for the United States Supreme Court. Judge Ginsburg believes that a prolonged confirmation process will not benefit the Nation or the Court. I commended Judge Ginsburg for his record and qualifications when I announced his selection, and I commend his selflessness and clear thinking now. I will move promptly to name another nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.
