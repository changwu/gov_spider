    Last week the U.S. Navy and Philadelphia signed several important agreements that are good for the city, the Navy, and our Nation. I want to thank Mayor Rendell, the people of the United States Navy, and others who were critical to this important achievement. These agreements, combined with the decision by the Norwegian company Kvaerner to invest here, will help transform Philadelphia's huge and historic naval shipyard, generating thousands of high paying jobs, helping to revitalize America's commercial shipbuilding industry. Working together, this remarkable partnership of business, labor, and Government will modernize the shipyard and train workers to produce state-of-theart commercial ships. Congratulations to the people of Philadelphia on an important new economic venture.
