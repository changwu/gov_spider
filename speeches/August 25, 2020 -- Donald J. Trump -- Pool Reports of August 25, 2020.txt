 in-town pool report #3: hurricane briefing 
Passing along from the White House:
Today, President Donald J. Trump joined Chief of Staff Mark Meadows for a briefing by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf and Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Peter Gaynor on the status of Tropical Depression Marco and Hurricane Laura in the Gulf of Mexico and the proactive preparations taken by the Administration. Administrator Gaynor stated that while Tropical Depression Marco continues to weaken, Hurricane Laura continues to strengthen. Current forecasts show Hurricane Laura will become a major hurricane over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and approach the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts late Wednesday or early Thursday. President Trump was briefed on the risks of life-threatening storm surge, wind, and rainfall hazards, including widespread flooding that could extend beyond Laura's center along the Gulf Coast. Administrator Gaynor stated that FEMA has pre-staged emergency response resources and commodities at strategic locations across the Gulf Coast that are ready to respond. He confirmed that these agencies continue to closely coordinate with State and local emergency managers to ensure evacuees have access to shelters equipped to limit the spread of COVID-19. The President stated that although emergency response in the United States is federally supported, it is also locally executed and State-managed. He directed his Administration to continue close coordination with State, local, tribal, and territorial partners to prepare for and respond to these storms. President Trump reinforced that individuals should follow guidance from their local emergency management officials and take early action to protect themselves, their families, and their property.

 In-town pool report #6: POTUS and FLOTUS in rose garden 
POTUS entered the Rose garden at 10:37 pm to a round of applause from the roughly one hundred guests in attendance. POTUS took a seat in the front row as a video introduction to Melania Trump played on a monitor set up by the podium.
FLOTUS then entered the Rose Garden at 10:39 pm, entering from the residence side and walking around the perimeter of the garden on the colonnade to the podium. The crowd applauded and she began speaking at 10:41 pm.
Melania Trump's remarks will be live streamed so pool will not provide quotes, but will send any color from offscreen.
