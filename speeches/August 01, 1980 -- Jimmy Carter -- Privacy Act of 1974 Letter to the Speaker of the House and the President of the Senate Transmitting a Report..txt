    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am herewith forwarding the Fifth Annual Report of executive branch activities implementing the Privacy Act of 1974.
The report shows that Federal agencies have successfully incorporated the Act's requirements into their daily activities and made the Federal workforce sensitive to privacy concerns.
With the success of these efforts in mind, I urge the Congress to proceed with its consideration of the Administration's legislative privacy proposals. Together, we have done much to identify and protect the privacy rights of our citizens, but our task is not yet finished.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
