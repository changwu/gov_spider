    I thank the leaders andâ€”from Congress for coming down to discuss the Iraq funding issue. Yesterday was a day that highlighted differences. Today is a day where we can work together to find common ground. I will inform the Speaker and the leader of our serious intent, and to that end, I am going to name our Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten, along with Steve Hadley and Rob Portman, to work with members of both parties to fund our troops.
I think it's very important we do this as quickly as we possibly can. I'm confident that we can reach agreement. I know that it's going to require good will, but we all care deeply about our country and care about this issue. And so I want to thank the Members for coming down again. I'm looking forward to our discussions. I'm looking forward to what will be constructive set of discussions and negotiations.
Thank you all.
