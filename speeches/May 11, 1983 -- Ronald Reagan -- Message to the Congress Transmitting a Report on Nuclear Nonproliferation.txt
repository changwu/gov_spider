    To the Congress of the United States:
Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is a long-standing and fundamental security objective. My Administration is strongly committed to that goal and has actively pursued it by reinforcing essential non-proliferation measures and by adopting new approaches where these will serve our nonproliferation interests.
As noted in my March 31 statement, for arms control to be complete and world security strengthened, efforts to halt the spread of nuclear arms need to be increased. We are undertaking further efforts with key countries on the need for urgent movement to strengthen measures against nuclear proliferation.
The activities of the Administration with respect to non-proliferation and peaceful nuclear cooperation during 1982 are described in the report called for by Section 601 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-242). The report has been prepared by the Department of State in collaboration with other concerned departments and agencies.
