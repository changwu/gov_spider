    Tonight, the sun set in Des Moines and Urbandale with two heroes no longer here. Des Moines Sergeant Anthony Beminio and Urbandale Officer Justin Martin started the day as they always did, pinning the shield on their uniforms as they kissed their loved ones goodbye to patrol the streets while the city slept. They knew the risks, but they walked out the door because that's who they were. Like law enforcement officers across the country, they were defined by duty, courage, and honor. They loved their cities. They would do anything for the people who counted on them. But as we've seen too often, a coward with a gun in his hand and malice in his heart assassinated these two heroes in cold blood. And as we've had to do too often, Jill and I join the nation in mourning with their broken-hearted families and their grieving brothers and sisters in blue.
And yet even in our sadness, we're still grateful for the swift actions of Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert, Urbandale Police Chief Ross McCarty, and their entire force who rushed to the scene and later quickly apprehended a suspect. We're inspired by the people of the Des Moines area who've rallied together in unity and prayer. And we're reminded that even in the face of evil, we are a nation still defined by goodness, by heroes like Sergeant Beminio and Officer Martin, by men and women in uniform across the country, who tomorrow morning as the sun rises, will live the words of Isaiah, "Here I am. Send me."
May God bless Sergeant Anthony Beminio, Officer Justin Martin, their families, and all who loved them and may God protect our law enforcement everywhere.
