    We welcome the formation of the Iraq Study Group, under the auspices of the U.S. Institute of Peace. This study is being undertaken by a respected group of Americans and we welcome their effort. This study will provide an independent look at the way forward in Iraq, a critical issue for U.S. national security, by people outside the government. The Administration will provide appropriate cooperation to the effort including, on a case-by-case basis, facilitating travel, access to people, and access to documents. We look forward to receiving the group's insights and advice.
