(House Rules)
(Rep. Lucas, R-OK)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3102, the Nutrition Reform and Work Opportunity Act of 2013. The bill would result in millions of Americans losing access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is one of our nation’s strongest defenses against hunger and poverty. These cuts would affect a broad array of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, including working families with children, senior citizens, veterans, and adults who are still looking for work. Slashing SNAP also weakens our nation’s farm and rural economies.
Congress should approach the reauthorization of the Farm Bill in a comprehensive manner. The Administration has called for the enactment of a multi-year Farm Bill that supports rural America while achieving significant deficit reduction. The President’s Budget proposes specific balanced reforms that would accomplish this goal without creating hardship for vulnerable Americans. The Administration urges Congress to follow that path and reject the harmful cuts contained in H.R. 3102.
If the President were presented with H.R. 3102, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
