    Vice President Pence and Prime Minister Trudeau met in Ottawa on May 30, 2019 to discuss the bilateral relationship and issues of mutual concern.
Canada and the United States reaffirm our strong partnership and the shared values that bind our two countries. Our nations believe in democracy, human rights, and respect for the rule of law, and we work together to promote these shared values in many places around the globe.
For this reason, the United States and Canada stand together to firmly reject the wrongful detention of two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and call for their immediate release. China's actions are damaging its international reputation and a deep concern for all countries that uphold the rule of law.
Canada and the United States welcome constructive, results-oriented engagement with China that concretely demonstrates respect for the rule of law, human rights, and fair and reciprocal trade.
