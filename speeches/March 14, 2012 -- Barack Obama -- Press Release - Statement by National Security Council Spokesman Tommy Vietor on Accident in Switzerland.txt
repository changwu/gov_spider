    The President sends his deepest condolences to the victims and their families of last night's bus accident in Switzerland. The loss of so many young lives is especially heartbreaking. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Belgian communities of Lommel and Heverlee and all the people of Belgium at this difficult time. As a close friend of both Belgium and Switzerland, the United States stands ready to provide whatever assistance may be helpful.
