    "The United States has arranged a meeting in Washington to deal with the crisis in Israel. American strategy for this meeting, and @ respect to the Middle East peace process generally, must be clear and decisive, We must demand an unconditional end to the violence. Our friend Israel must not be asked to make concessions as a means of restoring order.
"The recent violence has been fomented by those who would end any hope for a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel has taken great risks for peace including allowing the arming of 30,000 Palestinian police, who have used their weapons to fire on Israelis. The government of Prime Minister Netanyahu deserves the full support of the United States at this moment of crisis."
