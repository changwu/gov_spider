    Every year at this time the harvest season is celebrated throughout the hills and valleys of rural America, where country music has its roots. Country music chronicles the richness and fullness of American life, the hopes and dreams, joys and sorrows of those who have raised a great Nation from a bountiful land.
Because it expresses the simple human emotions we all share, country music is in tune with our everyday experiences, whether we live on a farm or in the city. This authentic American art form has grown to be one of the most popular styles of music in our Nation today.
It is fitting, therefore, that October be designated as "Country Music Month." I commend the Country Music Association for its contribution to this annual observance, and I invite all Americans to join me in saluting the talented performers who have given us so many hours of listening pleasure through country music.
