    THE Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defense has played an invaluable role in developing the close and effective cooperation of Canada and the United States in our common defense. I am confident that it will render equally signal service to the defense of our two countries in the years ahead. On this twenty-fifth anniversary of the Board, I am happy to extend my congratulations and best wishes.
