    Clinton Campaign Responds To Sen. Obama Attacks
Senator Obama attacked Senator Clinton today for not standing up to the oil industry. Really? Senator Obama is the only candidate that voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill and took more money from oil company executives than any other candidate last month:
Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said: "Sen. Obama might say he doesn't take contributions from oil companies, but he took more money last month from oil company executives than any other candidate. He might say he'll stand up to the oil companies but he's the only candidate who voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill that was written by energy lobbyists and has been called the best energy bill corporations could buy."
"With gas prices this high, talk is cheap. The American people need solutions."

Bush's 2005 Energy Bill Was Written By The Energy Lobby, Who Spent Millions To Ensure Passage
Public Citizen: Energy lobby gained 'exclusive, private access to lawmakers' to advocate for 2005 Energy Bill 'starting with vice-president Dick Cheney's energy task force': "On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into the law the energy bill; on July 28, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 275 to 156 to approve the energy bill; and on July 29, the U.S. Senate voted 74 to 26 to approve the energy bill. Since 2001, energy corporations have showered federal politicians with $115 million in campaign contributions—with three-quarters of that amount going to Republicans. This cash helped secure energy companies and their lobbyists exclusive, private access to lawmakers, starting with Vice-President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force, whose report provided the foundation of the energy bill passed by Congress and signed by President Bush on August 8."

Sen. Obama Has Acknowledged Pernicious Influence Of Lobbyists On Energy Policy He supported
Obama: 'You can look at how Dick Cheney did his energy policy...he met with oil and gas companies forty times, and that's how they put together our energy policy': "The one thing I have to remind folks, though, of – we've been talking about this through Republican administrations and Democratic administrations for decades. And the reason it doesn't change – you can take a look at how Dick Cheney did his energy policy. He met with environmental groups one, he met with renewable energy folks once, and then he met with oil and gas companies forty times, and that's how they put together our energy policy. We've got to put the national interest ahead of the special interest, and that's what I'll do when I'm President of the United States." [Democratic Presidential Debate, 7/23/07]
