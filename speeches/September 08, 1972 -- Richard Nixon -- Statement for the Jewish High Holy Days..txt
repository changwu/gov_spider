    THE SPIRIT of self-examination and moral rededication in which fellow citizens of the Jewish Faith across the country observe the High Holy Days is one from which all of us can draw courage and inspiration. It is the spirit on which the greatness of the Jewish people has been built. And it is also the spirit in which America's greatness has flourished.
So as we send greetings to our Jewish friends on the coming of a New Year in their calendar, it is well that we reaffirm the ethical principles and traditional values we so proudly share. As we ponder the message of these solemn religious days, we are reminded of the dynamic leadership which Jews have always displayed in man's struggle for freedom, human dignity and justice. And we find sustenance and strength not only in the significance of their beliefs, but in the substance of their deeds.
May the New Year bring our fellow Americans of the Jewish Faith nearer to the fulfillment of their individual hopes, and may it bring the world a just and lasting peace.
