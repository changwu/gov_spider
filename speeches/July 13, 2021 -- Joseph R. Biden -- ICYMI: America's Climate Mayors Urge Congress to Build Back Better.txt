    Today, as part of the bipartisan network of Climate Mayors, more than 140 leaders from across the country wrote a letter to congressional leaders urging them to address climate change, create economic opportunity, and confront injustice as they work on infrastructure and economic recovery packages to build back better and create good-paying jobs in support of a resilient, clean energy future.
"Cities across the United States are hubs of leadership, innovation, and resilience," the mayors wrote. "We are committed to rebuilding stronger and better, to mitigate structural inequities, to tackle an increasingly destabilizing climate, and to build opportunities for Americans to thrive and reach their full potential … Cities are ready to meet this moment and build an economy that is inclusive, robust, and sustainable."
The group of mayors – chaired by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and co-chaired by Madison Mayor Satya-Rhodes Conway and Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego – urged Congress to ensure federal programs and funds benefit disadvantaged communities and advance environmental justice, include workforce standards for good-paying jobs and careers, and funding like block grants that provide flexibility for cities to meet their specific and unique socio-geographic challenges.
And, the mayors pledged to be partners throughout an equitable and sustainable recovery, underscoring that in cities big and small they meet the needs of disadvantaged communities, create good jobs, and build stronger communities if Congress makes the investments needed to build back better.
