Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the New Hampshire Romney for President Legislative Leadership Team. These 40 Republican legislators represent citizens from across the Granite State and will play an instrumental role in building on Governor Romney's strong grassroots support there.
"I'm honored to have the support of so many New Hampshire Republican leaders. Their help will be invaluable as we work unite Ronald Reagan's Conservative Coalition. Together we can make America better by strengthening our military, our economy, and our families," Governor Romney said.
New Hampshire House Republican Leader Mike Whalley said, "Governor Romney has run a campaign that respects the New Hampshire people, primary and process. He is a conservative leader on the issues that are important to voters in our state, and we know he will continue the fight to keep taxes low and cut government spending.
