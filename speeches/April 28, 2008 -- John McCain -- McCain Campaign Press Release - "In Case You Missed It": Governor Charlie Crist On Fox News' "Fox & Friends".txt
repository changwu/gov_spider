GOV. CRIST: "We're working hard to balance our budget and make sure that we have an opportunity to cut gas tax as much as we possibly can. It's hard to do in a tight budget year, but people need relief. Senator McCain understands that and that's why he's pushing for it, and I think it's exactly the right thing to do."
