    Dear Mr. __________:
In accordance with section 514(a) of Public Law 103-236 (22 U.S.C. 1928(a)), I am submitting to you this report on implementation of the Partnership for Peace (PFP) initiative.
The ongoing adaptation of Europe's security structures to post-Cold War realities remains one of our highest foreign policy priorities. A central element of this adaptation is the extension of NATO's zone of stability and security to Europe's emerging democracies. Over the past two and a half years, the Partnership for Peace has made a significant contribution to this goal by forging new cooperative ties between the Alliance and its Partners. This U.S. initiative has united NATO Allies with countries recently emerged from communist and traditionally neutral states in a partnership based on respect for democratic principles, peaceful resolution of disputes, and practical cooperation.
For all Partners, PFP will be an enduring instrument for forging stronger ties with NATO. For those Partners interested in joining NATO, PFP is the best path to membership. As you will see from the enclosed report, NATO and its Partners have made impressive progress in broadening and deepening the Partnership over the past year. We are working with our Allies and Partners to build on the Partnership's early momentum in the shared conviction that cooperation and common action are the best means to achieving lasting security throughout the Euro-Atlantic area.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
