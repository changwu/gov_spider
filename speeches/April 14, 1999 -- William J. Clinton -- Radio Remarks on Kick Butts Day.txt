    Today, on Kick Butts Day, young people all across America are speaking out against teen tobacco use. These kids are right. It's tragic— and it's wrong—that every day 3,000 kids become regular smokers. So I urge Congress to stand with our kids and stand up to the tobacco companies who are targeting our children. I urge you to make sure the tobacco settlement funds are used to reduce youth smoking. It's time all of us worked together to give our children the healthy future they deserve.
