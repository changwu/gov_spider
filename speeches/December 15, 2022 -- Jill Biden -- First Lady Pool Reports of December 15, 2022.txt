FLOTUS Pool #2 - Dr. Biden Remarks
Pool was brought into a room where FLOTUS is hosting the brunch with African First Ladies at 11:09am.
FLOTUS began her remarks at 11:10am, opting to step away from the podium and mic and instead speak to attendees as she walked around the room.
"I feel so weird. I'm gonna walk down," said Dr. Biden. "I'm a teacher. I mean, I just have to walk around."
She highlighted the African American museum's dark history, and how it can be used to strengthen relationships.
"This special place really preserves the memory of some of our nation's darkest moments. But it also features some of the what is the best to come in the United States."
"I brought you here because I wanted to really explore and celebrate the sheer cultures and traditions that connect us that continue, really and strengthen our relationships today."
She also noted the significance of the food.
"We know food fills our stomachs, but also feeds our souls," said Dr. Biden.
She said the lunch being served for lunch showcase "many of the foods that Americans eat every day, and they're part of the traditions that transplant to the to the countries throughout the African continent."
