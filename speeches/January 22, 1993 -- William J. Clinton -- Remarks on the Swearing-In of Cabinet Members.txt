    The President. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today I am proud to present to you and to the American people a Cabinet of talented, diverse, and seasoned leaders.
I'm deeply gratified to the United States Senate for their quick confirmation of 18 nominees only 2 days after the Inauguration. The Senate acted with historic dispatch because it recognizes that our Nation needs action now on our problems. I very much appreciate that, and like them I am ready to get to work.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to now present the Chief Justice to administer the oath of office. Mr. Chief Justice.
Chief Justice Rehnquist. Would you each raise your right hands and repeat after me. And the first phrase is "I, blank," and obviously there you insert your name— [laughter] —"do solemnly swear."
[At this point, the Chief Justice administered the oath of office.]
The President. Let me, first of all, say I'm glad no one said "I, blank." [Laughter] There will be time enough for those blanks in the days ahead. [Laughter]
I think now we're supposed to adjourn to the State Dining Room, is that correct? Is that right?
I also want to recognize my Ambassador to the United Nations-designate, Madeleine Albright, who has not quite been confirmed by the Senate, but I think she will be soon. Because she teaches at my alma mater, I thought she ought to have a separate swearing-in ceremony. [Laughter]
So I think that's it. Let's adjourn, please, to the reception in the State Dining Room. Thank you.
