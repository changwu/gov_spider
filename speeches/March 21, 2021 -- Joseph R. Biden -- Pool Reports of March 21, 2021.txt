pool report #5/Biden comments on border 
The president stopped and spoke with pool for a minute.Are you thinking of going to the border?
"At some point I will, yes."
Do you want to see what's going on in those facilities first hand?
"I know what's going on in those facilities."
Why isn't the message to migrants to stay home resonating and can more be done?
"A lot more. We're in the process of doing it now, including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was they can stay in place and make their case from their home country."
The president stepped off Marine One, saluted, turned and held Dr. Biden's hand as she stepped down. They walked together and then president peeled off as questions were shouted.
Dr. Biden waited at the doorway until he was done and they walked inside together.
We have a lid.
