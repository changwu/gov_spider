    Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this historic occasion. The commissioner and I—that would be Frank Robinson, the Hall of Fame—[applause]—welcome you for the first all-star game here on the South Lawn of the White House.
We've got 50 players from 50 States, plus the District of Columbia, who have shown—come to show off their great baseball skills. And we're excited you're here. We welcome you; we welcome your families.
We want to thank Kenny Chesney for lending his great talent. We're proud you're here, Kenny. Thanks for coming.
I do want to welcome our baseball coaches today. We've got four fabulous coaches who've agreed to come: Ryne Sandberg, Hall of Famer—he's kind of pulling for the Cubs this year; John Smoltz of the Atlanta Braves. Our second game coaches: from the Baltimore Orioles, Kevin Millar—he'll be—here he is; and finally, two-time All-Star, Rick Monday. There he is. Hi, Rick. Thanks for coming.
I do want to welcome our announcers today, Mike and Mike. Yes, sir! Mike Golic and Mike Greenberg, we're proud you guys are here. We expect them to call a good game.
I do want to say that a member of my Cabinet, Carlos Gutierrez, has joined us. Mr. Secretary, thank you for coming.
And finally, Mr. Commissioner, we are so lucky to have Shelby Shayler with us today. She will be presenting you and I with the first ball, but not quite yet. Before we do, we're going to recite the Little League oath.
Are the players ready? All right, here we go.
[At this point, the pledge was recited.]
Play ball!
