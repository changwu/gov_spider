    I strongly condemn the senseless violence that claimed the life of an off-duty police officer, and injured others, in Birmingham, Alabama, this morning.
This bombing was an unforgivable act that strikes at the heart of the constitutional freedoms and individual liberties all Americans hold dear. It is specifically in order to protect those liberties that I signed into law legislation that makes it a Federal crime to interfere with a woman exercising her constitutional right to visit a women's health center. We will continue to enforce that law to its fullest extent, and to protect our Nation's family planning clinics.
Federal agents are already in Birmingham to assist local law enforcement officials in bringing the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.
Hillary and I join all Americans in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of the victims.
