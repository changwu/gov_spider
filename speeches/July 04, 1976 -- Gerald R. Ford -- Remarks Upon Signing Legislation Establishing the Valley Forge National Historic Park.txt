    Governor Shapp, Senator Scott, Senator Schweiker, Congressman Schulze, Secretary Kleppe, distinguished guests:
This is a great privilege for me to sign this very important bill on George Washington's desk. I am deeply grateful because of the strong congressional support over a long period of years. Senator Scott, Senator Schweiker, Congressman Schulze, and many others took the lead, and the net result is that under this legislation, the Federal Government will take over this historic site and it will be known as the Valley Forge National Historic Park.
It will be a great tribute to those that I mentioned in my remarks, to those who gave so much, and the sacrifices that they made.
So, I congratulate you, Hugh Scott. I congratulate the other Members of the House and Senate who did such a fine job in making this signing possible.
And so, Governor, we are delighted to take over and make certain that the good work of the State of Pennsylvania is carried on and that this historic site will become another in the complex of national historic sites for the preservation of those things that mean so much to us--those sites that contributed so significantly to our national history and our national progress.
Thank you very much.
