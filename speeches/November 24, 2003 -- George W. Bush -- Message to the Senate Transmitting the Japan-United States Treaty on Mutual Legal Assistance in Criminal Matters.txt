    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the United States of America and Japan on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Washington on August 5, 2003. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, a related exchange of notes and the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties negotiated by the United States in order to counter criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective tool to assist in the investigation and prosecution of a wide variety of crimes. The Treaty is self-executing.
The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: taking testimony, statements, or items; examining persons, items, or places; locating or identifying persons, items, or places; providing items from governmental departments or agencies; inviting persons to testify in the requesting Party; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; assisting in proceedings related to forfeiture and immobilization of assets; and any other form of assistance permitted under the laws of the requested Party and agreed upon by the Central Authorities of the two Contracting Parties.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
