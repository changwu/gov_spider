    Today the Romney for President campaign announced a convention-wide rollout of Square, the innovative device leading the mobile donation industry.  Square-enabled phones and devices will be used throughout the 2012 Republican National Convention providing a quick and easy way for delegates and visitors to make donations and buy souvenirs with a simple swipe of their credit card on a mobile device.
"We are excited to be the first Presidential campaign to make serious use of Square devices at a major event like a national convention." said Zac Moffatt, Digital Director of the Romney for President campaign.  "More importantly, we are excited to empower a national grassroots movement by providing each attendee the ability to take their Square devices back to their home state and engage with their communities." 
The Square feature enables the Romney for President campaign to mobilize supporters of the campaign and empowers them to accept credit and debit card contributions on their mobile device on behalf of their organization.
Once a supporter signs up, they download the free Square Card Reader app and receive a free card reader. When supporters collect payments, funds are deposited in the campaign's bank account the next business day. The campaign ensures FEC compliance by easily collecting the required information within the app during the contribution process.
Square devices will also be provided to each Victory location.
