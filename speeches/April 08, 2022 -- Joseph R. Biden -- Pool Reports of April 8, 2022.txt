In town pool report #1 - info on today's KBJ event
Good morning. I'll be your pooler today.
The only thing on POTUS' public schedule today is the 12:15 p.m. event with Judge Jackson on the South Lawn, so more to come in a few hours. But wanted to pass along this info from the White House about the invites:
Invited to today's commemoration of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic and bipartisan Senate confirmation are Judge Jackson's family, all current and former Justices of the Supreme Court, members of the Cabinet, all U.S. Senators who voted to confirm Judge Jackson, members of House Democratic Leadership, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the chairs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee, Democratic members of Congress from Florida, and key stakeholders including labor leaders, Tribal leaders, and advocacy groups.

In town pool report #2 - on the South Lawn
The pool (and a larger group of photographers) were brought out to the South Lawn just after 11:30 a.m. to set up for the event with POTUS and KBJ, scheduled to start at 12:15 p.m.
There are already hundreds of people milling about, chatting and taking pics of themselves on the lawn with the flag-bedecked South Portico behind them.
There are also a few dozen flags lined up in the driveway and four sections of folding white chairs about 8-12 rows deep arrayed in front of the presidential lectern, which looks to be positioned about 150 feet from the door to the south portico.
The Marine band is seated on the east side of the lawn and playing. It's a pretty perfect April day out here, 58 degrees and sunny with an almost cloudless sky.
I will tweet a photo of the set-up and send another note when we get a 2-minute warning or sooner if news warrants.
The remarks will be available in all the usual places, including whitehouse.gov/live.
