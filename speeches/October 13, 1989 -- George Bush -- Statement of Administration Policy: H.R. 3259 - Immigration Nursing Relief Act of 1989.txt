    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Schumer (D) New York and 4 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3259 because it would:

single out one profession (i.e., nursing) for preferential legislative treatment with respect to the immigration laws; and  
prohibit the Department of Justice — through September 30, 1992 — from undertaking rulemakings concerning the H-l nonimmigrant visa category.
