    The President and First Lady announced today that this year's White House Easter Egg Roll will be held on Monday, April 1st. The event will feature live music, sports courts, cooking stations, storytelling and, of course, Easter egg rolling. In support of the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative to ensure that all our children grow up healthy and reach their full potential, the activities will encourage children to lead healthy, active lives. The White House will open its South Lawn for children ages 13 years and younger and their families.
White House Easter Egg Roll tickets will be distributed through an online lottery system, allowing guests from across the United States to participate in a tradition that dates back to 1878. The lottery will open for entries on February 21st at 10:00 AM EST and close on February 25th at 10:00 AM EST. Tickets are free of charge and are non-transferable.
