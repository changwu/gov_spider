    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4606, the "Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995."
This Act provides funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; the Corporation for National and Community Service; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; and several smaller agencies. Programs within these agencies address the training and employment needs of our Nation's work force, the Federal role in our education system, and fundamental elements of our health care network.
This Act provides funding for a number of my high-priority investment proposals within the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and the Corporation for National and Community Service. These include the Head Start program, Goals 2000 program, School-to-Work Opportunities program, dislocated workers assistance, education for the disadvantaged, AIDS treatment programs authorized under the Ryan White CARE Act, and the National Institutes of Health.
I am pleased that the Act provides my full request for childhood immunizations. This program will ensure that all children who do not have health insurance coverage for immunizations have access to immunizations at the appropriate age.
The Act provides funding for investment initiatives for automation and disability processing within the Social Security Administration (SSA). This will help SSA improve the quality of service to millions of Americans.
