    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: National Hispanic Heritage Week
September 10 through 16 has been designated National Hispanic Heritage Week. A series of town meetings will be held during this week in selected cities throughout the country where there are significant Hispanic population concentrations. The purpose of these meetings will be to listen to the views of the Hispanic community on current economic and social issues, particularly education, jobs, housing, health and criminal justice.
Top level Hispanic appointees in each of your agencies have been asked to participate in these town meetings. I have asked that they report to me on the views expressed at the meetings and what kind of action needs to be taken by the Departments and Agencies to deal with the problems identified. I hope you will cooperate in this effort by making available to us the Hispanic appointees who have been asked to participate in the week's activities.
The importance of National Hispanic Heritage Week should not be underestimated. It is a special opportunity to reaffirm this Administration's commitment to ensuring the full participation of our Hispanic citizens in all levels of our society and government.
