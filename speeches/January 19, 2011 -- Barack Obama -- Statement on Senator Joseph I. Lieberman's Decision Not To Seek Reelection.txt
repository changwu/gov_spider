    I want to congratulate Senator Joe Lieberman on an extraordinary career in public service. Joe has spent four decades fighting for what he believes in on behalf of the people of Connecticut. From cracking down on polluters and deadbeat dads as Connecticut's attorney general to his years of work defending our Nation's security on the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees to his relentless efforts in recent months to repeal "don't ask, don't tell," his work has touched countless lives in his home State and across the country. Even if we don't always see eye to eye, I always know Joe is coming from a place of principle. I know he will carry with him that integrity and dedication to his remaining work in the Senate and to whatever he chooses to do next.
