    The President has been briefed on yesterday's elections in the Republic of Korea. He will be sending his congratulations to the winner. The enthusiasm of the Korean campaign and the remarkable voter turnout of 90 percent is impressive.
This speaks clearly of the commitment of Koreans to the democratic process. The candidate of the Democratic Justice Party, Mr. Roh Tae Woo, appears to be the winner by a substantial margin.
