    [Dated October 21, 1976. Released October 22, 1976]
I AM withholding my approval from S. 3553, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, for technical reasons.
In its haste to adjourn, the Congress passed identical Senate and House bills on this subject. At the time the Senate passed the House bill, H.R. 11315, it attempted to vacate its earlier passage of S. 3553 but was unable to do so because it had left the Senate's jurisdiction. The House, unaware that the Senate had passed the House bill, also passed the Senate bill.
In view of the Senate's action in attempting to vacate its passage of S. 3553, there is doubt that S. 3553 has been properly enrolled, and therefore I am separately approving H.R. 11315 and must withhold my approval from S. 3553.
