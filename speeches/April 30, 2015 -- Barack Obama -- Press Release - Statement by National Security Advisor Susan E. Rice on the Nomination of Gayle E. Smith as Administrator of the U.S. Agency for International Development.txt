    I am very pleased that the President has nominated Gayle Smith today as Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Gayle has been a valued colleague and friend, and her many years of field experience, including in Africa, as well as her steady leadership, sharp intellect, and deep knowledge of international development make her an exceptionally qualified nominee for USAID Administrator. Gayle has served at the highest levels of government for nearly 15 years, and I have been privileged to have had her by my side as the Senior Director for Development and Democracy on the National Security Council staff. Her expertise and vision have been instrumental to the Administration's successes in promoting food security, global health, Power Africa, and the Ebola response, to name just a few of our humanitarian and development priorities. If confirmed by the Senate, I know Gayle will continue to use her remarkable talents to lead USAID at a time when its contributions to international development and humanitarian response are more essential than ever.
