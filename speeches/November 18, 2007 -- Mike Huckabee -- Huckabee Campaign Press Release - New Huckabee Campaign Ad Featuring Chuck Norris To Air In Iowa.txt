    Little Rock, AR - During an exclusive interview on Fox News Sunday this morning, former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee unveiled a new television ad featuring actor Chuck Norris that will begin airing in Iowa on Monday, November 19.
The 60-second TV ad, called 'Chuck Norris Approved," features Norris' endorsement of Huckabee as a "principled, authentic conservative." The ad also discusses Huckabee's support for the Fair Tax, securing the border, and the 2nd amendment.
"This is a light-hearted ad which draws attention to important issues. We want to show that running for President is serious business but a person can have fun doing it. I appreciate Chuck Norris' endorsement and his participation in the ad, which was designed to spotlight some key issues and to draw interested voters to our website," said Huckabee.
