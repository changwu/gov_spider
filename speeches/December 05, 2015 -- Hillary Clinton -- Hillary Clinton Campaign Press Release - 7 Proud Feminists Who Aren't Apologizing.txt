When Emma Watson delivered a landmark speech at the U.N.'s HeforShe launch last year, she was urged to scrap the word "feminism" from her remarks.
But, as she revealed earlier this week, she refused:
"I thought long and hard and ultimately felt that it was just the right thing to do," she recalled in a recent interview. "If women are terrified to use the word, how on earth are men supposed to start using it?"
Emma is spot onâ€”and she's not alone. Also on the list of proud feminists:



  " I think some big actors and musicians feel like they have to speak to their audience and that word [feminism] is confusing to their audience. But I don't get it. That's like someone being like, ?I don't really believe in cars, but I drive one every day and I love that it gets me places and makes life so much easier and faster and I don't know what I would do without it.'"





  " The term feminist is so inclusive now. There isn't one way to be a feminist or to practice feminism, to exercise feminism. You can be feminist in lots of different ways because the point is freedom of choice."





  " I am a feminist. When I stop and think about it, there's no other way I can label myself. I am for women."





  " All men should be feminists. If men care about women's rights, the world will be a better place."





  " I've always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly, it's very simple. It's just a person that believes in equality for men and women."





  " I'm a feminist because I believe in women... it's a heavy word, feminism, but it's not one I think we should run from. I'm proud to be a feminist."


And, of course, Hillary Clinton.?
