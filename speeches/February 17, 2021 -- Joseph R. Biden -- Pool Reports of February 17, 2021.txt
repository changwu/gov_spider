Pool report #11/Oval spray part 2

Pool ushered out at 4:10. More to come.

Pool report #12/Oval spray part 3 
VP Harris seated to the right of President Biden. Trumpka across, near the Resolute Desk. Others spread around the room.
Biden: "Every once in a while as president, you get to invite close friends into the Oval….A lot of these folks have been my friends for a long, long, long time. As they say in parts of my state, these are the folks that brung me to the dance." (FIXING dance QUOTE from pool report #11)
"We are so far behind the curve. We rank like 38th in the world in terms of infrastructure, everything from canals to highways to airports, to everything we can do and we need to do to make ourselves competitive in the 21st Century."
More Biden: "I learned based on the polling data they want they want everything in the plan -- not a joke. Everything in the plan. … I asked a rhetorical question, those who opposed the plan: What don't they like?... Don't they want to help people with nutrition? Don't they want to help people be able to pay their mortgages? Don't they want to help people get their unemployment insurance? Don't they want to make sure that people are able to stay in their homes without being thrown out of their homes in the middle of this godawful pandemic? What don't they like?"
Then your pooler asked about the Netanyahu call and we got the "good conversation" response.
