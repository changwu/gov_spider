    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Schroeder (D) Colorado and 24 others)
The Administration is strongly opposed to the enactment of H.R. 2401, because it would:
— impose extremely detailed and onerous reporting requirements on Federal agencies, contradicting recent efforts by Congress and the Administration to eliminate unnecessary paperwork and reduce the number of reports to Congress; and
— intrude upon the President's responsibilities for Executive branch management by delaying realignments or reorganizations of Federal field offices that are needed to improve the Government's operational efficiency.
