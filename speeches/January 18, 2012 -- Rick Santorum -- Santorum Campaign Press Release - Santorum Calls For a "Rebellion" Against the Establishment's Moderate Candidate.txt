Mt. Pleasant, SC - The Rick Santorum for President campaign released a newÂ ad that calls for a "Rebellion" against the establishment's moderate candidate, because we cannot follow the establishment over a cliff like we did in 2008 in picking another moderate who could not draw bold contrasts with Barack Obama.

Script of "Rebellion"
Voice Over:
The establishment is once again telling us to fall in line...and vote for their backroom hand picked moderate candidate.
They're telling us to simply ignore the fact that Romney supported the Wall Street bailout.
Ignore that Romneycare includes taxpayer funding of abortions.
We should simply forget that Mitt Romney once bragged he's even more liberal on social issues then Ted Kennedy.
In fact, we should simply follow them blindly...just like we did last time...over a cliff.
Not again.
Rick Santorum:
What wins in America are bold ideas, sharp contrasts, and a plan that includes everyone.
And a plan that includes people from all across the economic spectrum...
A plan that says we will work together to get America to work.
Voice Over:
Let's unite behind a candidate who not only shares our conservative values, but can beat Obama.
Rick Santorum for President. Join the fight.
Rick Santorum:
I'm Rick Santorum and I approve this message.
