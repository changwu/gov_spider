    Today, Romney for President announced its Catholics for Romney coalition.
"I am honored to have the support of Catholic leaders from all over this country," said Mitt Romney. "The Catholic Church embodies all that is great about America—loving your neighbor, defending life, and helping the less fortunate to overcome poverty and rise in the world. Forming a more perfect union requires that we continue to turn these principles into reality. If I am elected president, that will be my highest priority."
"As a life-long Catholic, I learned very early that we must love our neighbors as we love ourselves," said Congressman Paul Ryan. "That principle has informed my life in public service, and I am pleased to have so many leaders in the faith supporting Mitt Romney and me in this election. We understand that policymakers must target the root causes of poverty with reforms that promote economic growth and opportunity.  Free enterprise and strong communities remain the best means to promote upward mobility and help individuals escape the trap of government dependency. It is an honor to support Governor Romney as he advances solutions that champion the dignity of every human being. That is a goal that people of all faiths can support."
