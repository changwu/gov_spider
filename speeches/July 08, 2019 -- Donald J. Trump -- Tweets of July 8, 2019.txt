Watching @FoxNews weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings Fake News @CNN or Lyin' Brian Williams (remember when he totally fabricated a War Story trying to make himself into a hero & got fired. A very dishonest journalist!) and the crew of degenerate......Retweets: 19873Favorites: 84416

.....Comcast (NBC/MSNBC) Trump haters who do whatever Brian & Steve tell them to do. Like CNN NBC is also way down in the ratings.

...a 'source' of information (ask the Times what they paid for the Boston Globe & what they sold it for (lost 1.5 Billion Dollars) or their old headquarters building disaster or their unfunded liability? @FoxNews is changing fast but they forgot the people who got them there!Retweets: 16293Favorites: 71660

Impossible to believe that @FoxNews has hired @donnabrazile the person fired by @CNN (after they tried to hide the bad facts & failed) for giving Crooked Hillary Clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable. Now she is all over Fox including Shep Smith by far....Retweets: 22100Favorites: 98949

....their lowest rated show. Watch the @FoxNews weekend daytime anchors who are terrible go after her big time. That's what they want - but it sure is not what the audience wants!Retweets: 15729Favorites: 81218

Brilliant Constitutional Lawyer Dr. John Eastman said the Special Prosecutor (Mueller) should have NEVER been appointed in the first place. The entire exercise was fundamentally illegal. The Witch Hunt should never happen to another President of the U.S. again. A TOTAL SCAM! https://t.co/5sRAMhHAR8Retweets: 26324Favorites: 84733

I have been very critical about the way the U.K. and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit. What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way. I do not know the Ambassador but he is not liked or well....Retweets: 25471Favorites: 123653

....thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him. The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister.
