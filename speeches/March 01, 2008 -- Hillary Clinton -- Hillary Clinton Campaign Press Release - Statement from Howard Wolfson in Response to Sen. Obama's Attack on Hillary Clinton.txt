    In an effort to deflect attention from voters asking whether he is ready to lead on national security, Barack Obama launched a series of negative attacks against Hillary Clinton today.
In response, Howard Wolfson, Communications Director, issued the following statement:
Real change isn't attacking NAFTA in Ohio while news outlets report that your chief policy aide told the Canadians your criticism is just rhetoric.
Real change isn't attacking lobbyists while utilizing their services throughout your campaign.
Real change isn't voting against a cap on credit card interest rates and opposing a freeze on home foreclosures on subprime borrowers.
And real change isn't running away from a debate on national security because you don't have the strength and the experience to go toe to toe with John McCain.
