    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bumpers (D) Arkansas)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1259, which would require the Secretary of the Interior to permit access across land within the Buffalo National River to specified private land. This extraordinary relief has been denied in administrative and judicial proceedings because the individual involved, in the words of the U.S. District Court, "was misled by no one and he invited his present predicament ... he has other access to [his] property . . . Accordingly, enactment of S. 1259 would set an undesirable precedent.
