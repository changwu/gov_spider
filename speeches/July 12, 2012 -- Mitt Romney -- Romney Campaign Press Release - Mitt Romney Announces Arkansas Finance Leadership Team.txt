    Mitt Romney today announced his Arkansas State Finance leadership team.
"I am pleased to have the support of these great Arkansans," said Mitt Romney. "Arkansans are looking for a change of direction after three years of failure from President Obama. If we are going to defeat President Obama and put in place policies that create jobs and help the middle class, I will need their support and hard work."
"We are all proud to be a part of the Romney team," said Arkansas Finance State Co-Chair Warren Stephens. "President Obama has had over three years to fix our economy and it is clear that he is in over his head. Mitt Romney has a decades-long record of job creation and the pro-growth plan to get the country on the right track. We all look forward to working our hardest to help provide the resources needed to defeat President Obama and turn around the country."
