    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards announced he would participate in the voter-generated presidential video forum 10Questions.com. 10Questions.com was created in cooperation with The New York Times Editorial Board and MSNBC and is co-sponsored by more than 40 cross-partisan online organizations and blogs. Edwards is the first presidential candidate to agree to participate in the forum.
"Whether it's Iraq, Iran, Social Security, trade or tech policy, the American people deserve straight talk and a leader who will have the strength to tell voters where they stand," said Edwards. "Through 10Questions.com, I look forward to answering questions from voters across the country and discussing my bold and detailed plans to end the corruption in Washington and make our government work for regular Americans again."
10Questions.com gives users the opportunity to submit video questions to the candidates through a variety of online video platforms including YouTube, MySpace, Yahoo, AOL and Blip.tv. The 10Questions site then enables the public to vote for the questions they'd like to see answered, and at the end of four weeks, the top ten questions will be submitted to all the major candidates. The candidates will then have four weeks to submit their video responses to the questions. As those responses are posted, 10Question.com users will be given the opportunity to vote on whether the candidates have answered the questions to their satisfaction. The New York Times Editorial Board is directing users to 10Questions.com through the online opinion section of NYTimes.com
"By agreeing to participate in the first truly people-powered online forum, John Edwards is giving all Americans hope that we can do better than just televised debates and sound-bite politics," says Andrew Rasiej, co-creator of 10Questions.com. "It also gives voters the opportunity to evaluate the presidential candidates based on the questions they most want answered."
