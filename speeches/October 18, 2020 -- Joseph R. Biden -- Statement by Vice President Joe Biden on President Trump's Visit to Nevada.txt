    When President Trump visits Nevada today, he needs to answer for his failed response to COVID-19 that has led to 88,000 Nevadans infected by this virus, his refusal to pass additional financial relief for families desperately in need of help during this economic crisis — including the nearly 200,000 Nevadans still out of work because of the pandemic — and his determination to undermine the health care of millions of Americans by seeking to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act.
Rather than take responsibility and lead, President Trump continues to downplay COVID-19. Donald Trump didn't take necessary precautions to protect himself and others. How can we trust him to protect Nevada families?
