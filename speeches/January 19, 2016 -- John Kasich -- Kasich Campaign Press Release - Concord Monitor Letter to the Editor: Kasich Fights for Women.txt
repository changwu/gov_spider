Concord Monitor
This election season we've already heard enough political rhetoric to bury us deeper than any snow that piles up outside. In the last few months, I've become convinced that Ohio Gov. John Kasic is one of the few presidential candidates who can point to a record of results behind the rhetoric.
Several weeks ago, Gov. Kasich and his wife, Karen, launched a new coalition called Women for Kasich, where they highlighted his record of producing real results for women, especially in the area of job creation. Since 2011, Kasich has helped Ohioans create more than 380,000 new private-sector jobs. These jobs represent thousands of new opportunities for women to advance their careers and support their families. Kasich also understands that an absence of childcare options is a major barrier for working mothers, so he expanded childcare access to struggling mothers so that they can better achieve financial independence.
Female voters want what everyone wants: The opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their family. The stakes in this election are too high to vote for a candidate without experience and the know-how to deliver results. My vote is with John Kasich.
