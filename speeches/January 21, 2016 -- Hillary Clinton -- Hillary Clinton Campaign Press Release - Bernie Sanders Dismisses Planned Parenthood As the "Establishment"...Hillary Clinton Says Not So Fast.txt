Earlier this week, Bernie Sanders declared that the only reason groups like Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign, and NARAL are supporting Hillary Clinton is that they're part of the so-called political "establishment."

There's too much at stake in this election for women's rights and LGBT rights to dismiss the organizations that fight for them as "establishment."
