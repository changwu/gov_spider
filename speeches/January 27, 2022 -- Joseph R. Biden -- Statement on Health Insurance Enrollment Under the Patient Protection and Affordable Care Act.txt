    Health care should be a right, not a privilege, for all Americans. And 1 year into my administration, we are making that right a reality for a record number of people, bringing down costs and increasing access for families across the country.
Today I am proud to announce that since November 1, 14.5 million Americans have signed up for quality, affordable health coverage, including more than 10 million who enrolled through healthcare.gov, the highest numbers ever produced in an open enrollment period. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that one in seven uninsured Americans got covered between the end of 2020 and September 2021, with lower income Americans gaining coverage at the highest rate.
This did not happen by accident. The American Rescue Plan did more to lower costs and expand access to health care than any action since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. It made quality coverage more affordable than ever, with families saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums and four out of five consumers finding quality coverage for under $10 a month. As a result, millions of our fellow Americans have now gained the security and peace of mind that dependable health insurance brings.
For Americans who live in California, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington, DC—places with their own health insurance marketplaces—the opportunity to secure that peace of mind extends through January 31, and I urge you to take these last few days to sign up for quality, affordable coverage. In the meantime, as long as any American lies awake at night, wondering how they're going to pay their medical bills, my administration will keep fighting to lower costs and expand health coverage even more, including through my Build Back Better agenda.
