    IN THE passing of Eugene Meyer, the nation and the news profession have lost an outstanding newspaper executive. As publisher and later as Chairman of the Board of the Washington Post and Times-Herald, and before that as a Government official in a number of major posts, Mr. Meyer was known as a distinguished citizen.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our deep sympathies to Mrs. Meyer and her family in the personal loss they have sustained.
