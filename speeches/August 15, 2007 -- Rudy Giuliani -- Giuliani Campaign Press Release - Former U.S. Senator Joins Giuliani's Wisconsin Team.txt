    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that former Wisconsin U.S. Senator Robert Walter Kasten, Jr. will serve as the campaign's Wisconsin State Chairman.
"Mayor Giuliani has a record of solving tough problems and showing strong leadership that will really resonate with Wisconsinites," said Kasten. "I am proud to join Rudy's team in this capacity and lead the efforts in our state to help promote his 12 Commitments to the American People."
Giuliani's Deputy Political Director Rick Wiley, the former Executive Director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Kasten will be a powerful addition to Rudy's Wisconsin efforts. "There is no one better than Senator Kasten to help spread the Mayor's positive vision for our country in Wisconsin and continue his already strong support in the state," Wiley said.
Kasten was previously announced as a senior member on Mayor Giuliani's Foreign Policy Advisory Board and will continue to serve in that capacity.
