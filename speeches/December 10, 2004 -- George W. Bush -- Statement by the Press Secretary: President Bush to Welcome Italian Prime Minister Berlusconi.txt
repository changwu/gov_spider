    President Bush will host Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi for a meeting and lunch on December 15, 2004. The President and the Prime Minister share a strong commitment to the value of freedom, and Italy is making vital contributions to democracy and stability in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and elsewhere. President Bush and Prime Minister Berlusconi will use this opportunity to discuss how the United States and Europe can work more closely together on the many common challenges we face.
