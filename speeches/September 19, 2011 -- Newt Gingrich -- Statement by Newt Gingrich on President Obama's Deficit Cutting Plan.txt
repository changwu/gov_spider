    Newt: Obama Fails the Test of Leadership
Council Bluffs, IA - Newt Gingrich released the following statement today reacting to President Obama's plan to reduce the deficit:
"Once again, President Obama fails the test of leadership. In the midst of the worst economy since the Great Depression, job creation must be job one for our political leaders. Instead, the president has chosen a path of political gamesmanship and class warfare with a plan that would kill jobs with higher taxes on small businesses and private capital. America only works when Americans are working, and President Obama's latest proposal just doesn't work."
