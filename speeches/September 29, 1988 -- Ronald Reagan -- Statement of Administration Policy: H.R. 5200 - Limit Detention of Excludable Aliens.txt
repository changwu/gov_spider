    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Swindall (R) Georgia and 5 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5200 because it conflicts with the well-established immigration law principle that distinguishes between excludable and deportable aliens. Aliens who are excludable from entering the country have fewer rights and privileges than deportable aliens who have already made an entry into the country. Consequently, it is inappropriate to condition the continued detention of an excludable alien upon the Attorney General's ability to prove that such alien poses a danger to the community or falls within one of the other categories specified in H.R. 5200.
