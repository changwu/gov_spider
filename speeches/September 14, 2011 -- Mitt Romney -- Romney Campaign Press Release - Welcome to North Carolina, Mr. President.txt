As President Obama Campaigns For A Jobs Plan That Even Democrats Don't Like, Nearly Eight In Ten Americans Believe The Economy Is Getting Worse:

Gallup's Economic Confidence Index Released On September 14 Is At Its Lowest Point Since February 2009. "Americans' confidence in the U.S. economy is now at its lowest point since February 2009 – near the conclusion of the recession that officially ended in June 2009. Gallup's Economic Confidence Index was -52 in August, above its financial crisis lows, but much lower than the -21 to -35 range measured from June 2009 to June 2011." (Lymari Morales and Elizabeth Mendes, "Three Years After Crisis, Little Sign Of Economic Relief In U.S.," Gallup.com, 9/14/11)
  


77 Percent Of Americans Polled By Gallup In August Said The Economy Is Getting Worse. "Americans' current level of economic confidence – which represents their views on the current state and future direction of the nation's economy – is decidedly negative. Seventy-seven percent said the economy was getting worse in August, the highest – by far – since February 2009, the month in which Congress passed a $787 billion stimulus bill in hopes of lifting the U.S. economy out the depths of the recession." (Lymari Morales and Elizabeth Mendes, "Three Years After Crisis, Little Sign Of Economic Relief In U.S.," Gallup.com, 9/14/11)
