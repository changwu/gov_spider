    Yesterday, National Security Advisor Tom Donilon spoke with Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa and expressed strong support for the Crown Prince's National Dialogue initiative. He also welcomed other steps that both the Crown Prince and King Hamad have taken in recent days to initiate an open dialogue on political reform with the full spectrum of Bahraini society. Mr. Donilon urged continued restraint by Bahraini security forces. As a long-standing partner of Bahrain, the United States believes that the stability of Bahrain depends upon respect for the universal rights of the people of Bahrain, including the right to peaceful assembly, and a process of meaningful reform that is responsive to the aspirations of all Bahrainis.
