Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker, the American Family, and the American Dream! #TrumpRallyNJ #KAG2020 https://t.co/Kq5KFhQmgHRetweets: 16476Favorites: 54771

If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died to secure—then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. Only this way, can we save the America we love – and drain the Washington Swamp once and for all! https://t.co/5NeC0mFWfURetweets: 29256Favorites: 104957

No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!Retweets: 38388Favorites: 160978

For a guy who couldn't get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago, couldn't get approved for anything since, "begged" me for a non Senate approved job, which I gave him despite many saying "Don't do it, sir," takes the job, mistakenly says "Libyan Model" on T.V., and..Retweets: 20549Favorites: 91099

Remember Republicans, the Democrats already had 17 witnesses, we were given NONE! Witnesses are up to the House, not up to the Senate. Don't let the Dems play you!Retweets: 30541Favorites: 124632

There is much talk that certain Democrats are going to be voting with Republicans on the Impeachment Hoax, so that the Senate can get back to the business of taking care of the American people. Sorry, but Cryin' Chuck Schumer will never let that happen!Retweets: 17350Favorites: 79890
