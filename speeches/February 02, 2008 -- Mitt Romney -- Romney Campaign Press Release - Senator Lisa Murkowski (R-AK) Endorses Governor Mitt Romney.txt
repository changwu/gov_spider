Boston, MA â€“ Today, just days ahead of Alaska's Caucus, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced her endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney for President of the United States. Senator Murkowski joins a strong Romney for President team that includes Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell.
"Governor Romney is the proven executive that Alaskans and all Americans need in the White House. At this time of economic uncertainty, we need a leader who actually understands how the economy works and why jobs are created. That leader is Mitt Romney. Furthermore, he has promised to tackle some of our country's most long-standing challenges, including energy independence. Like most Alaskans, he also supports opening up ANWR," said Senator Murkowski. "On Tuesday, Republicans in Alaska face a critical decision, and the choice is Mitt Romney."
Announcing Senator Murkowski's support, Governor Romney said, "Senator Murkowski has been a strong voice in the United States Senate for confronting the long-term economic challenges confronting her state and our nation today. She understands the importance of making our country independent of foreign oil and recognizes we can do that by developing more sources of domestic energy. In the coming days and months, I look forward to working with her to build a stronger America."
