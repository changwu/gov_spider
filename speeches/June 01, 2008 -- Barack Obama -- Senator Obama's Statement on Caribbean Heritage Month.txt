    "During this Caribbean Heritage Month, we celebrate the many ways that people of Caribbean descent have strengthened this country we love -- from serving brilliantly and bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan to helping grow our economy to enriching our culture. What has drawn so many Caribbean men and women to America is the same idea that drew my own father to America many years ago -- that America is a place where our dreams for ourselves and our families can come true. But too often today, those dreams are slipping out of reach. So let's rededicate ourselves to putting them back within reach for people of Caribbean descent and all Americans. That means fixing our economy so it works for everyone, making universal health care a reality, and giving every child a world-class education so they can compete in our global economy. But it also means supporting a robust partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations -- a partnership that helps strengthen democracy in the region, ensure the security of America's Third Border, and foster economic development to narrow the gap between rich and poor. Caribbean Heritage Month isn't only about celebrating the common past between the United States and Caribbean nations; it's about securing our common future. "
