    Thank you. Please sit down. Thank you very much. We just want to welcome you here. The big bonus of this evening is there are no speeches and no politics. Hillary and I just want to welcome you here and thank you for coming.
I also want you to know that this tent now has a hallowed heritage. On Saturday night I had my 25th college reunion under this tent, and nobody left until 1:30 a.m. So don't feel bashful if you want to stay awhile.
It is always a privilege to serve our country, but this is a unique time for all of us because of the point in history in which we find ourselves. And I just thought it would be great if we could get together and enjoy each other's company, get to know each other a little better.
I thank you all for coming, all of you for bringing your spouses, your staff members, your friends, and I hope you enjoy yourselves tonight. This is, after all, your place. I'm just a temporary tenant. I'm glad to be here, glad to welcome you here, and I wanted Hillary to say a word, too, because we're both so pleased to be a part of this evening.
Thank you again for coming.
