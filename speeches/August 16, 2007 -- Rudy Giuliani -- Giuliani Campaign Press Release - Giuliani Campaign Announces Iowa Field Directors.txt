    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today seven regional field directors to organize campaign operations in communities across Iowa. The Giuliani campaign has also named Bruceanne Phillips as Iowa Coalitions Director and Jarrod Agen as Iowa Communications Director.
The campaign staff will work closely with Iowa Executive Director K.C. Jones, who manages the day-to-day campaign operations throughout the state, and Iowa Political Director Tony Delgado, who has been on the ground in Iowa for months building grassroots support and a volunteer base.
"Rudy Giuliani is the best Republican candidate to defeat the Democrats in the general election. Rudy is building a campaign staff in Iowa focused on winning the Caucuses in January," said Giuliani's Iowa Chairman Paul Pate.
