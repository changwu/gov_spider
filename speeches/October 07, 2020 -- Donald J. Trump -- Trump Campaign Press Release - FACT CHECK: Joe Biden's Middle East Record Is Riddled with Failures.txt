He will never stand up for America on the world stage. 
Joe Biden presided over 47 years of foreign policy failures that appeased terror regimes around the world, led to the rise of ISIS, kept America in endless conflicts overseas, and left Americans less safe.
As former Obama-Biden Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, Biden "has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."


Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He later lied about it, falsely claiming that he came out against the war "immediately, the moment it started."


Joe Biden claimed Iraq would be "one of the greatest achievements" of the Obama-Biden Administration, shortly before ISIS rose to power and declared a caliphate over enormous swaths of the Middle East.


Joe Biden kept American troops locked in endless conflicts overseas. He later tried to scrub his record, claiming that he "got 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq." The Washington Post gave that claim two Pinnochios


Biden opposed successful U.S. missions to take out dangerous terrorists:


Biden opposed the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden, telling then-President Obama: "Mr. President, my advice is don't go."


Obama admitted during a 2012 presidential debate that Biden opposed the raid to take out Bin Laden.


Biden opposed President Trump's decision to kill notorious terrorist Qasem Soleimani, claiming it would cause a "major conflict across the Middle East." This major conflict never materialized.


The Obama-Biden Administration delayed a mission to potentially rescue American Kayla Mueller, who was captured, tortured, raped, and killed by ISIS.


Kayla's parents said the decision showed "more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo, than the American hostages in Syria"


Biden coddled the dangerous Iranian regime during his eight years as vice president and left the U.S. military in tatters:


He pushed through the Iran Nuclear Deal, which supercharged Iran's ability to fund terrorism around the world and did not stop Iran for obtaining a nuclear weapon.


Biden and Obama secretly shipped Iran pallets of unmarked cash and let Iran get away with taking Americans hostage.


The Obama-Biden administration left the U.S. military massively depleted, leaving American troops less safe in conflicts overseas, and Americans less safe at home.
