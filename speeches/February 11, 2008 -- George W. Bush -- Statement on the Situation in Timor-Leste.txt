    I strongly condemn the violent attacks against Jose Ramos-Horta, President of Timor-Leste, and Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao, Prime Minister of Timor-Leste. Laura and I offer our condolences to the families of those killed in the attacks, and we send our prayers for a rapid recovery to President Ramos-Horta and the others injured.
Those who are responsible must know that they cannot derail democracy in Timor-Leste, and they will be held accountable for their actions. The United States remains committed to working with the people of Timor-Leste to strengthen democracy there. I also offer my full support to the Government of Timor-Leste, the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, and the International Stabilization Force as they work to maintain calm and security.
