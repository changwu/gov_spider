    Congress has lost a tenacious champion of America's elderly and an unrelenting fighter for health care reform, open markets, and free trade with today's decision by Representative Sam Gibbons not to seek reelection.
From his days as a hero on the beaches of Normandy through his 34 years in Congress, Sam Gibbons has served his country and fought for what he believed. As a Congressman, Representative Gibbons has been a leader in domestic policy, particularly in the defense of America's senior citizens and the protection of their health care. In recent years, he has worked tirelessly on efforts to provide health care coverage to all Americans.
The American people are grateful for Sam Gibbons' long service. His deep dedication to the Congress and to the American people will be sorely missed.
