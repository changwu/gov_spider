    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and Italy, signed at Rome on January 18, 1973. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty significantly updates the extradition relations between the United States and Italy and adds to the list of extraditable offenses both narcotic offenses, including those involving psychotropic drugs, and aircraft hijacking.
The Treaty will make a significant contribution to the international effort to control narcotics traffic and to cope with other offenses. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
