    Mitt Romney today announced campaign chairs for the District of Columbia.
"I'm pleased to have the support of such distinguished leaders in our party," said Mitt Romney. "They share my values of getting our country back on track through strong pro-growth policies, including my plan to create jobs, pay down our national debt, and scale back the size of government. This continued level of strong support shows that our message is resonating throughout the country."
"Mitt Romney is the candidate we need to reverse President Obama's failed policies and broken promises," said Romney District of Columbia Campaign Chair Betsy Werronen. "From his failure to turn around the economy to the passing of Obamacare, these last three years have hurt middle class families and plunged small businesses into further uncertainty. Mitt Romney spent his life as a conservative businessman, turning around companies and creating new jobs. That is precisely the type of leader we need. I am proud to stand with Mitt and even prouder to welcome Teri Galvez and Rich Counts to the team."
