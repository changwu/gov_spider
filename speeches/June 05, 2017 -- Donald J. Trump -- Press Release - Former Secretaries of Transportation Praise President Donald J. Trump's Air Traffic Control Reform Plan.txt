    Secretaries of Transportation from three different administrations – Republican and Democrat – praise President Donald J. Trump's plan to shift air traffic control functions to a new, non-governmental entity
Secretary Ray LaHood (2009-2013): "I applaud President Trump for his leadership in putting forth a bold plan and vision for moving ATC out of FAA and creating a more efficient and effective Air Traffic Control. This will enable the quicker and smoother implementation of Nexgen technology."
Secretary Mary E. Peters (2006-2009): "By his action today President Trump moves forward the long-delayed modernization of America's Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. This bold action will make air travel more efficient, save aviation fuel, and provide a more dependable air passenger experience."
Secretary James H. Burnley IV (1987-1989): "Air traffic control is a complex twenty-four hour a day business. While it is very safe, government red tape increasingly impedes the installation of new technologies. As a result, the U.S. is falling ever further behind other countries, such as Canada, that have separated their systems from government constraints. President Trump's proposal is the right solution for the 21st Century."
