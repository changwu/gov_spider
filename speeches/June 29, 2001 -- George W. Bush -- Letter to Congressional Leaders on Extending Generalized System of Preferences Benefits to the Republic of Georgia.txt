    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 502(f) of the Trade Act of l974, as amended (the "Act"), I am writing to notify you of my intent to add the Republic of Georgia to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for a wide range of products from beneficiary developing countries.
I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the Act and have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Georgia.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
