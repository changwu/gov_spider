    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. DeFazio (D) Oregon)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1567 because it inequitably provides for the distribution of funds to the members of the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians, a group which is neither the modern day successor to the historic Cow Creek tribe, nor substantially made up of descendants of that tribe.
Further, H.R. 1567 could expose the United States to unwarranted financial liability because representatives of Cow Creek descendants who are not members of the beneficiary Band have indicated that they would file a claim against the United States if H.R. 1567 is enacted. Should their claim be successful, the United States would, in effect, pay for the historic Cow Creek claim twice.
If H.R. 1567 is presented to the President in its present form, the Secretary of the Interior will recommend veto.
