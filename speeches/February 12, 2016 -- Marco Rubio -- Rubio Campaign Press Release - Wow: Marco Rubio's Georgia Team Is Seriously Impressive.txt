Twenty-six new conservative leaders, including Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, have joined Marco's Georgia Leadership Team.The latest addition came today, with former Georgia Republican Party Chairman Alec Poitevint joining the team. He had this to say:
Having endured almost eight years of President Obama, Americans are frustrated with the direction of our country. I am one of them. The only way to turn it around and advance our conservative cause is to win in November. I believe the only candidate who can do that is Marco Rubio. His conservative values are second to none.
Team Marco also added a ton of new members earlier this week.

Georgia votes on March 1 in the so-called SEC Primary.
Rep. Austin Scott, who chairs Marco's Georgia effort, says it's a clear sign of enthusiasm:
The momentum behind Marco's campaign is undeniable, and we are excited to add an impressive list of Georgia leaders to the team today.
Republicans across the country are rallying behind Marco because he has an optimistic vision for our nation and a detailed plan to usher in a New American Century. Georgians will play a very important role in ensuring we nominate the candidate best suited to defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in November, and I look forward to working with this outstanding team to energize voters as we approach the March 1 primary.
State Senator Dean Burke, of Bainbridge, praised Marco's record:
A lot of politicians in Washington have talked about the harmful impact Obamacare is having on families across the country but few have actually done anything about it.
Early on, Marco warned of a taxpayer bailout of the insurance industry, and he succeeded in stopping it, already saving taxpayers $2.5 billion. That's the kind of leader we need in the White House, someone who can not only identify problems but can implement solutions.
Team Marco in Georgia held a press conference to highlight the big additions:
