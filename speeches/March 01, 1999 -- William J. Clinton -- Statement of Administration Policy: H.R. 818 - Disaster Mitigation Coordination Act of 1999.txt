    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Talent (R) MO and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 818. The Administration has repeatedly supported approaches to emergency management that emphasize preparedness in addition to response and recovery, and has requested authority to guarantee Disaster Mitigation loans in the FY 2000 Budget. These disaster mitigation loans will significantly assist communities in their efforts to avoid the crippling effects of natural disasters.
