    I believe a vigorous science and technology enterprise involving the private sector is essential to our economic and national security as we approach the 21st century. Accordingly, I have today issued an Executive order, "Facilitating Access to Science and Technology." It is important not only to ensure that we maintain American preeminence in generating new knowledge and know-how in advanced technologies but also that we encourage the swiftest possible transfer of federally developed science and technology to the private sector. All of the provisions of this Executive order are designed to keep the United States on the leading edge of international competition.
