    Warm greetings to all who are celebrating Passover.
This festival chronicles God's deliverance of the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. With faith and determination, these courageous people sought liberation from slavery and a path to freedom. Although their journey was long and fraught with peril, the children of Israel reached the Promised Land to rebuild their communities in the sweet air of freedom.
More than three millenia later, Jews across America and around the world gather during Passover to commemorate this epic journey. The holiday seder itself is rich with symbolsâ€”of the suffering endured by the Israelites in Egypt, the difficulties encountered during their exodus, and their unquenchable hope for the future. And throughout this ritual meal, unifying and sanctifying it, prayers are recited in praise of God and in gratitude for His intervention in the struggle of the Israelites.
This year Passover has fresh meaning for us. The seder's bitter herbs and salt water remind us of our sorrow at the death of Yitzhak Rabin and the loss of so many innocents to the evil of terrorism. But as this harsh winter ends, we remember as well that God still lights our path and that, with courage and hope, the best in human nature will still prevail.
Hillary and I extend warm wishes for a memorable Passover.
