    To the Congress of the United States:
Recognizing that our military forces must always maintain a high degree of preparedness, the Congress in 1965 authorized a cash incentive program to reward military personnel for imaginative suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.
Today I am pleased to forward to the Congress the reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on cash awards made during fiscal year 1972. Tangible benefits resulting from suggestions submitted by military personnel that were adopted during that year totalled more than $107 million, bringing the total first-year savings for taxpayers from this worthwhile program to $661 million.
Of the 157,195 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel during the reporting period, 24,580 were adopted. Cash awards totalling $1,822,762 were paid for these adopted suggestions. Enlisted personnel received $1,502,660 in awards, representing 82 percent of the total cash awards paid. The remaining 18 percent was received by officer personnel and amounted to $320,102.
The reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation contain more detailed statistical information on the military awards program and also include a few brief descriptions of some of the better ideas of our military personnel during fiscal year 1972. For example, two Air Force sergeants were awarded a total of $25,000 for suggesting a modification to the F-105 weapons control system. Their new idea improved the combat capability of the aircraft, enhanced the safety of aircrews in the Southeast Asia Theater of operations and saved more than $25 million of the taxpayers' money in the first year.
I commend these reports to the attention of the Congress.
