    On Tuesday July 12 in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris will participate virtually in the annual leaders' meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum, which is taking place in Suva, Fiji. The Vice President will underscore the commitment of the United States to the Pacific Islands region and discuss opportunities to deepen U.S. engagement in the region and areas to deliver concrete results for the people of the Pacific. The Vice President will celebrate the longstanding bonds between the United States and the Pacific Islands and will outline our ongoing work to strengthen them. This engagement builds on President Biden's remarks to the Pacific Islands Forum meeting last year and Secretary Blinken's trip to Fiji earlier this year.
