    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period February 1, 1998, to March 31, 1998. The previous submission covered events during December 1997 to January 1998.
U.S. efforts on the Cyprus issue intensified following the February 15 completion of the Cypriot Presidential elections. In my letter of congratulations to President Clerides on his reelection, I reiterated U.S. support for the U.N. process to achieve a settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation and expressed the hope that both parties would bring new ideas and creativity to the table. A parallel message was sent to Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash. Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas J. Miller visited the region March 7-13 to consult with the leaders of both Cypriot communities, as well as Turkish and Greek officials, on how best to address the core issues of the dispute. The Greek Cypriot decision to purchase S-300 antiaircraft missiles and the Turkish Cypriot suspension of bicommunal contacts continued to be of concern.
It is also important to note that U.S. investigators recovered remains from northern Cyprus that were identified as those of Andrew Kassapis, a Cypriot-American who disappeared during the 1974 conflict. Under separate cover, as required by law, I have transmitted a full accounting of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Government on the fate of Mr. Kassapis and four other U.S. citizens missing from Cyprus. I hope that this report will serve as a catalyst for progress on other cases of Greek and Turkish Cypriot persons missing as a result of intercommunal violence.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
