    A Presidential agricultural task force will arrive in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 30. Resulting from President Reagan's initiative at last year's summit meeting in Cancun, Mexico, the task force will study ways in which Venezuela and the United States can cooperate in agriculture and review agricultural matters of importance to the Venezuelan Government.
Earlier this year similar task forces, arranged by the U.S. Agency for International Development, went to Peru, Thailand, and Honduras. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, with AID assistance, has organized this task force for Venezuela. It will be headed by former Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Clarence D. Palmby.
Members of the task force will work with the Venezuelans to improve their marketing, storage, and distribution of food. They will also make recommendations on how to develop information systems for agricultural planning and promote greater private investment in the country's agro-industry. The task force will return to the United States on November 13, 1982.
