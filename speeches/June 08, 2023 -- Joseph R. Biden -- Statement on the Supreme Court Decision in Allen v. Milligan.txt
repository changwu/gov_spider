    Today the Court ruled that Alabama likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing a map that diluted Black votes in the State. The right to vote and have that vote counted is sacred and fundamentalâ€”it is the right from which all of our other rights spring. Key to that right is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials, not the other way around. Today's decision confirms the basic principle that voting practices should not discriminate on account of race, but our work is not done. Vice President Harris and I will continue to fight to pass both the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act and the Freedom To Vote Act to ensure fair congressional maps and that all Americans have their voices heard.
