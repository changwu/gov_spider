    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Ensign (R) NV)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 449, but will seek amendments in the Senate to ensure that the bill's proposed land transfers are consistent with the requirements of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other environmental laws.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 449 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB is still developing its PAYGO estimate for this bill.
