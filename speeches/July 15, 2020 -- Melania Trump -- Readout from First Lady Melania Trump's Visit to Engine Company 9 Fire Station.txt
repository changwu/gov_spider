    Today, First Lady Melania Trump made an unannounced visit to Engine Company 9 fire station in Washington, D.C. to deliver a donation of boxed lunches prepared by the White House chefs, Be Best tote bags, reusable face masks and hand sanitizer. The First Lady met with firefighters and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel from Engine Company 9 and policemen and women from the neighboring DC Metropolitan Police Department Third District.
Engine Company 9 in 4th Battalion, which includes Ward One, is an emergency response and life-saving fire station that works to promote health and safety in the Nation's Capital. The DC Metropolitan Police Department Third District serves the historic U-Street corridor area and is a highly visited, commercial and residential section of the capital well known for its ethnic and cultural diversity. The Third District aims to protect and serve, and works hard to build a safer and stronger connection between neighbors, police and the community.
During the unannounced visit, the First Lady handed out boxed lunches and spent time engaging in conversation about daily work life, challenges they have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the strength and resiliency of their communities.
"I appreciated today's opportunity to give my thanks to some of D.C.'s bravest and finest. The President and I will continue to support our dedicated firefighters, police members, EMS personnel and other critical first responders who put their lives at risk each day in order to keep our neighborhoods safe. We are grateful for their teamwork, professionalism and courage, and the vital role they play in communities throughout the country."
