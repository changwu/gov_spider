President Bill Clinton took over Hillary's Snapchat yesterday and shared a behind-the-scenes look at the excitement on the ground in the final days before the Iowa caucusâ€”as only he can. 
For the first event of the day, President Clinton set off for Fairfield, Iowa. 
In Fairfield, he rallied a huge crowd with stories from when he first met Hillary. 
Shaking hands with everyone can be slow going. 
On the way out of Fairfield, President Clinton stopped for coffee ... 
... and then made his way to Muscatine. 
And kept making his way to Muscatine ... 
... for quite some time. 
With so much free time in the car, President Clinton decided to share some of his favorite facts about Hillary.




The long drive was worth it: The crowd in Muscatine was very excited to see him. 
Shaking hands after the speech, President Clinton saw a young woman holding a saxophone and had to get a picture with her. 
Then he headed to Davenport to reunite with Hillary. 
Backstage, he watched as Hillary told an excited crowd about her vision for America. 
"She is the best change-maker I have ever known," he said in his last rally of the day. "And with your help and your caucus voices, you can make her the next president of the United States."
After Hillary was done giving her speech, President Clinton sent his last "snap" of the day.
