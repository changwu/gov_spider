    Today, as the House of Representatives considers final passage of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, new polls from Morning Consult/Politico and CNN show sustained, broad, and bipartisan enthusiasm among the American people for the relief package and its key components.
CNN's polling found that among Americans, "61% support the $1.9 trillion economic relief bill proposed by Biden" and that "several key provisions of the bill are even more popular." CNN found that an overwhelming majority of Americans across party lines "support policies in the bill that would provide larger tax credits for families and make them easier for low-income households to claim," with 85% of Americans supporting these policies, including 73% of Republicans.The polling also found that 3 in 4 Americans support funding to safely reopen schools (77%) and $1,400 checks for individuals and families bearing the brunt of the crisis 76%). CNN noted both provisions have bipartisan support from a majority of Americans with 55% of Republicans supporting each.
Politico/Morning Consult's new polling also found continued widespread support for the American Rescue Plan across party lines. Their new polling found 75% of Americans support the rescue package, including a majority of Republicans (59%) and a majority of voters who supported Trump in the 2020 election (55%). Politico/Morning Consult also found strong support for the American Rescue Plan among key constituencies with nearly 3 in 4 of both Baby Boomers and Evangelicals saying they support the package.
