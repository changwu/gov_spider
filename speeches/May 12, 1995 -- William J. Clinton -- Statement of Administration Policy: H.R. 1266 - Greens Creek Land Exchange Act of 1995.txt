    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Young (R) AK and Miller (D) CA)
The Administration supports the enactment of H.R. 1266.
Pay-as-You-Go Scoring 
H.R. 1266 could affect offsetting receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
