FLOTUS Pool Report No. 2 - White House arrival 
FLOTUS' motorcade pushed through rush hour traffic and arrived back at the White House at 7:55 a.m.
We passed by one demonstrator on the National Mall who waved his sign at the motorcade that said, "No negotiation with the Cuban regime."
FLOTUS lingered outside the SUVs on the South Lawn driveway talking to staff and walked into the White House at 7:59 a.m.
It has been an absolute pleasure serving as your pooler on this trip.
Have a great Monday!
