    The estimates released today by CBO once again confirm the progress we've made in bringing down deficits and expanding access to healthcare under the Affordable Care Act. Under the President's leadership, the deficit has already been cut by about two-thirds as a share of the economy, the fastest sustained deficit reduction since World War II.
CBO's longer-term budget and economic projections confirm the need for Congress to act to strengthen our economy for the middle class while putting our debt and deficits on a sustainable trajectory, including by making the investments that will accelerate economic growth and generate good new jobs for our workers to fill. We look forward to discussing the President's plan to bring middle class economics into the 21st Century and finish the job of putting our Nation on a sustainable fiscal path in more detail when the President's FY 2016 Budget is released on Monday, February 2.
