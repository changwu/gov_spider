    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has issued the following statement on today's jobless report showing unemployment at 9.1 percent:
"Mr. President — we gave you $2.4 trillion in new spending and the American people got nothing in return. Today's jobs report showing that the economy created no jobs in the last month and unemployment at 9.1 percent is further evidence that President Obama's failed economic policies are not working and have completely stalled job growth. After spending three days last month on a bus tour focusing on jobs — today's economic report shows that the nation's economy is sitting at a huge stop sign. Before his vacation, the President gave us a speech about a jobs speech; the American people don't need speeches, they need jobs.
"It's time for a comprehensive restructuring of how Washington spends taxpayers' dollars by controlling spending and encouraging pro-growth economic policies. Mr. President — it's time to stop digging our country further into debt — it's time to build a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth to restore certainty for the American people and the markets."
