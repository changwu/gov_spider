    The United States congratulates the people of Guinea for overcoming logistical challenges to participate in largely peaceful elections on October 11 that reflected the will of the Guinean people, who turned out in record numbers. We commend the elements of Guinean civil society that contributed to a successful election, including the religious and community leaders who consistently called for peace and the various groups that supported a transparent process by joining election observation missions throughout the country.
