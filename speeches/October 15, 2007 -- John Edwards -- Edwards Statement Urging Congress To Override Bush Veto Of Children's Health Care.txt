    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement on the debate in Washington over President Bush's veto of legislation to expand children's health insurance to cover 10 million kids:
"There's something wrong when in a country of our wealth, 47 million Americans don't have health care. There is something drastically wrong when 9 million American children—including nearly 50,000 in Iowa—don't have health care.
"President Bush's veto of the S-CHIP bill shows the importance of nominating a candidate and actually electing a president who will not compromise when it comes to children's health care, who will fight the lobbyists and special interests who stand in the way of truly universal health care, and who will never compromise on our Democratic values.
"I urge all Members of Congress to put aside their partisan interests, stand up for the millions of children without health insurance, and override Bush's veto. And if they don't, if the Republicans stand in the way of progress, I am committed when I am the Democratic nominee to make sure that we elect a Congress that will help move this nation forward with the bold change we need, starting with truly universal health care."
