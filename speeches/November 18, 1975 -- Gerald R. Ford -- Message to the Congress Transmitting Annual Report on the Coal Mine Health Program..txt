    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to you the Fourth Annual Report on Health Activities covered by the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, Public Law 91-173.
The report is a compendium of coal mine health research, medical examinations of coal miners, and other activities of 1973. It covers the implementation of the coal mine health programs carried out by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
It is encouraging to note that, in 1973, the Department published the final results of the first round of medical examinations of coal workers as required in the act, and that the Department's coal mine health research program continued to move significantly toward its goal of preventing the development and progression of coal workers' pneumoconiosis.
I commend this report to your attention.
GERALD R. FORD
The White House,
November 18, 1975.
