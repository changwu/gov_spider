    Christian is an innovator. He helped develop a first-of-its-kind digital strategy in 2020, one that has continued to be a key part of this administration's approach to reach Americans in new, creative, and authentic ways. As a day-one member of my team, Christian returns to the White House with a wealth of experience in the ways technology, digital media, and social platforms can be used to strengthen our democracy and bring people together.
The way we consume information is undergoing a fundamental shift. Under Christian's leadership, my Office of Digital Strategy will remain at the forefront of this change, navigating how people exchange information on a daily basis.
