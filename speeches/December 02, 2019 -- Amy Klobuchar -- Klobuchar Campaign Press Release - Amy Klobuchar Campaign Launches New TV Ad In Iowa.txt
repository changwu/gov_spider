    With 63 Days Until The Iowa Caucuses, 'Questions' Will Begin Airing This Week
MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€” Today, the Amy for America campaign announced a new TV ad buy ahead of the Iowa caucuses. 'Questions,' which begins airing on broadcast and cable in Iowa this week, highlights how, as President, Amy Klobuchar will hold big drug companies accountable and bring down the costs of prescriptions drugs.
"In the Senate, Amy's led the fight to bring down the costs of prescription drugs and hold big drug companies accountable," said Amy For America campaign manager Justin Buoen. "As President, she will build on those results by taking immediate and aggressive action to lower prescription drug costs and will hold opioid manufacturers responsible for their role in the opioid epidemic and make sure they pay their fair share to fix the crisis they helped create."
The ad will begin airing ahead of Klobuchar's 25th visit to Iowa -- where she has already visited 68 counties and has the support of more current and former members of the Iowa Legislature than any other candidate.
