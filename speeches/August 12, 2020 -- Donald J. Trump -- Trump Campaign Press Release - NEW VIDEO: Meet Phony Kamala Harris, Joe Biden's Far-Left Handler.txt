    Americans should worry about her being just one heartbeat away from the presidency.

Phony Kamala Harris isn't just Joe Biden's new far-left handler, she's the most radical nominee for vice president in American history. Biden – who is so diminished that he needed a script to understand why his handlers chose her to be his running mate – is an empty vessel for Harris and her extreme, left-wing agenda. Harris was rated the most liberal senator in the U.S. Senate last year, and the latest video from the Trump campaign shows why:

Harris isa strong supporter of Bernie Sanders's socialist takeover of health care.
Harris said she would "eliminate" 180 million Americans' private health insurance plans – even if they liked their plan and wanted to keep it.
Harris said she wants to give health care to illegal aliens.
Harris said she would vote for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, which would take away the jobs of millions of energy workers.
Harris said she wants to ban all fracking, killing jobs in states like Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas, New Mexico, and Ohio.
Harris opposes the death penalty, even for cop killers.
Harris supports taking away Americans' guns by force.
Harris said there should be a "conversation" about letting rapists and terrorists like the Boston Marathon bomber vote from prison.

Phony Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's political living will. Her radical-left beliefs should cause every American to worry about her being just one heartbeat away from becoming president.
