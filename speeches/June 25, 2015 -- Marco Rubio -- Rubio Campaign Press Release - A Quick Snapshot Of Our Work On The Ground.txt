Already, our campaign has made great progress in building teams on the ground and meeting with voters. Here's a quick snapshot of our work on the ground — made possible thanks to your support.

Since launching our campaign in April, Marco has already made two visits to the Hawkeye State. Our state chairman, Senator Jack Whitver is leading a growing team on the ground and Marco is drawing larger crowds with every visit. In April, Jack hosted a house party in support of Marco at his home in Ankeny. Marco has made other visits to Ames, Boone, and Des Moines, and will be back in the state soon.



Marco is in the Granite State today and will be participating in a veterans event and hosting a town hall meeting. In May, he spoke at the First in the Nation Summit, went door knocking with Dennis Green for his special election for state representative, and attended a house party in Manchester.



In the Palmetto State, Team Marco continues to thrive — last week we announced two co-chairs for the state: Rep. Nathan Ballentine and Rep. Neal Collins. Last month, Marco spoke to a packed house at Cong. Jeff Duncan's SC Freedom Summit, met with faith and business leaders, and shook hands with voters at Greenville's Artisphere festival. All of Team Marco's thoughts are with the strong people of South Carolina as the state continues to heal and come together at this time.



Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison leads our team in the Silver State, where Marco celebrated his birthday last month. During our most recent visit to Nevada, Marco met with grassroots leaders, hosted a roundtable with technology entrepreneurs, and attended a house party in Reno. Marco spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas, where his father worked as a bartender in a casino and his mother as a hotel maid, so there's a lot of pressure on Team Marco Nevada!
