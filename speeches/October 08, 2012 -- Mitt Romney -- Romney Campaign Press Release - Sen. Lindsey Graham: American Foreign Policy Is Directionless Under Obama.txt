    South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"American foreign policy is directionless under President Obama. He has diminished our influence around the world, shaken the confidence of our friends, and emboldened those who do not share our values. Gov. Romney understands that we cannot throw off the mantle of leadership without endangering the hope for a more peaceful and prosperous world. He will stand with our friends and allies, restore the economic and military foundations of our strength, and return America to our traditional leadership role in the world."
