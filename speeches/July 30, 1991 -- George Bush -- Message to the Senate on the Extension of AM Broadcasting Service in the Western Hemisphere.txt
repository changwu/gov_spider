    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Regional Agreement for the Use of the Band 1605 - 1705 kHz in Region 2, with annexes, and two U.S. statements as contained in the Final Protocol, signed on behalf of the United States at Rio de Janeiro on June 8, 1988. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Agreement.
The Agreement establishes a frequency allotment plan and associated procedures designed to enable the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) member countries in Region 2 (Western Hemisphere) to implement the AM broadcasting service in the 100 kHz band (1605 - 1705 kHz) adjacent to the upper end of the existing AM broadcasting band. It is the result of two sessions of a Regional Administrative Radio Conference held in 1986 in Geneva, and in 1988 in Rio de Janeiro, under the auspices of the ITU. The Agreement is consistent with the proposals of and the positions taken by the United States at the 1988 conference. Given the history of harmful interference to U.S. AM broadcasting stations in the existing AM radio band from various countries in the Region (particularly Cuba), the United States, at the time of signature, submitted statements on this subject that were included in a Final Protocol to the Agreement. The specific statements, with reasons, are given in the report of the Department of State.
I believe that the United States should become a party to this Agreement, which provides for the expansion in an orderly manner of the AM broadcasting service in the Western Hemisphere into the band 1605 - 1705 kHz. It is my hope that the Senate will take early action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
