Utah Senator Orrin Hatch is now backing Marco, joining all four Utah House members: Reps. Love, Chaffetz, Stewart, and Bishop.Here's why Senator Hatch said he's joining the team:
In these difficult times, it is critical for Republicans to nominate a candidate who understands both the challenges and opportunities confronting America in the 21st century.
Marco Rubio has demonstrated sound judgment in foreign affairs during his time in the Senate as well as articulating a vision for how to rejuvenate America's economy. Marco Rubio is also the only candidate in the race capable of uniting our party and reaching independent voters we need to win the White House. Marco has a unique ability to effectively communicate detailed, conservative plans in a way that attracts people who do not normally vote for Republicans. It is for all of these reasons that I am proud to support Marco Rubio for president.
Hatch is the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, and is currently chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.Senator Hatch, welcome to Team Marco!
