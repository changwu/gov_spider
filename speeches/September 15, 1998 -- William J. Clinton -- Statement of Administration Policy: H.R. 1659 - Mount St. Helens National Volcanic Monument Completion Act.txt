    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) WA and four others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1659, which would provide for the Federal acquisition of private mineral rights within the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. During further consideration of the bill, the Administration will work with Congress to identify the necessary offsets.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1659 would increase direct spending; therefore, the bill is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The bill does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, its net budget costs could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill (in the form of the manager's amendment) is that it will increase direct spending by $4.2 million in FY 1999. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate. If H.R. 1659 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within seven working days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the Congressional session, as required by OBRA.
