    The President announced his intention today to appoint former Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as the U.S. Representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), with the rank of Ambassador.
"In addition to earning her place in our own country's political history, Geraldine Ferraro has been a highly effective voice for the human rights of women around the world," said the President. "As alternate head of the U.S. delegation to this year's session of the UNHRC, she spoke eloquently on behalf of women in the former Yugoslavia and brought all of the parties involved to a consensus position. I look forward to her continuing her strong and much-needed advocacy in this new position."
