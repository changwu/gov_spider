Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the release of the Bin Laden video:
"Osama Bin Laden is the face of evil. His stated goal is conversion by compulsion, the surrender of liberty to terror and the abandonment of the foundations of a free society. The war against radical jihad must not cease until the fanatics of al-Qaeda are defeated."
