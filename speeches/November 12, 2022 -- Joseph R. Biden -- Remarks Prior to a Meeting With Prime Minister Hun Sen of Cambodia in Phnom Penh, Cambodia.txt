President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, you came a long way to the United States, and you chaired a very important meeting and made a significant impression on the centrality of ASEAN to the United States and to all our colleagues.
We have a long agenda today, I know—and I'm anxious to get to it—but from pandemic recovery to tackling the rising energy prices and food insecurity.
But I also want to thank you for Cambodia's clear condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and for your leadership of ASEAN during what had to be one of the most difficult years. So thank you for that.
And as I said last year in our viral [virtual; White House correction] summit, and again in May, the United States is committed to ASEAN centrality. We are committed to that.
We remain committed to seeing the return of democracy in Myanmar and working with the ASEAN to ensure implementation of the Five-Point Consensus that is out there.
We've got a lot of work to do, but I'm looking forward to a productive U.S.-ASEAN summit and delivering on our shared vision of peace for all of our people. And I look forward to the meeting. Thank you again for your hospitality.
