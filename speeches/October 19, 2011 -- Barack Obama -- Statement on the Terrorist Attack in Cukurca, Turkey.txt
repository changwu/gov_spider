    The United States strongly condemns this morning's outrageous terrorist attack against Turkey, one of our closest and strongest allies. On behalf of the American people, I offer my condolences to the families of the victims and to all of the Turkish people.
The United States will continue our strong cooperation with the Turkish Government as it works to defeat the terrorist threat from the PKK and to bring peace, stability, and prosperity to all the people of southeast Turkey. The people of Turkey, like people everywhere, deserve to live in peace, security, and dignity. As they pursue the future they deserve, they will continue to have a friend and ally in the United States.
