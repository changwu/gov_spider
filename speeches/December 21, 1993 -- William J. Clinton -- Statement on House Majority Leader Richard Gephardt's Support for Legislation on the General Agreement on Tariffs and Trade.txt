    I welcome Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's support for the implementation of the Uruguay round agreement. His statement reflects the fact that we have a strong agreement that promises important benefits for U.S. industry, services, and agriculture. The majority leader's support will help make it possible to implement the agreement expeditiously, with a strong base of congressional support.
The overriding commitment of this administration in trade policy has been to open markets and expand trade—multilaterally where possible, and bilaterally where necessary—and to enforce trade laws against unfair trade practices by other trading nations. The successful Uruguay round result strengthens our hand in doing so, and I look forward to working with the majority leader and others in Congress on the implementing legislation.
