Hillary Clinton's campaign in Nevada has been built on one simple idea.

And for Nevada state director Emmy Ruiz, the true power of this campaign is the team that's come together for Hillary.


For the past 10 months, organizers have been knocking on doors, making phone calls, and pouring everything into making sure Nevadans caucus for Hillary—and inspiring everyone around them to work harder than ever before.


And when it gets tough, they keep each other going.
"When I think ?I'm so tired,' I think of each and every single one of them, and their commitment to this campaign," Emmy says.


"Or Omar," she says, "who is growing up Muslim in this country and who needs someone who's going to fight for his community."
"Or our precinct captain, Donna. Donna works so hard. She's in our offices every day."


And when Donna got a chance to meet Hillary, she shared one of the reasons she's working so hard.
"Donna was telling her that her grandkids had autism," Emmy says.



For the last 10 months, Hillary has heard from Nevadans from all walks of life—and learned from them.
"Here's somebody who's really taken the time not just to listen, to study up and learn about everything from autism to national security to Alzheimer's to substance abuse to the issues that affect Nevada."


Watch the full story of what Hillary is fighting for in Nevada—with a little help from her friends.
