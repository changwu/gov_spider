    Dear Mr. Speaker:
On September 6th, I submitted a supplemental request totaling $2 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for urgent needs associated with Hurricanes Charley and Frances. The Congress' prompt action on this request ensured that immediate response efforts to these recent disasters would continue uninterrupted. In addition to utilizing the supplemental funds provided in Public Law 108-303, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, Federal Government agencies will continue to use existing resources and programs for response and recovery efforts.
I now ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests, totaling $3.1 billion, for additional emergency FY 2004 supplemental appropriations for the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, and Veterans Affairs, the Corps of Engineers, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Small Business Administration, and the Executive Office of the President.
I hereby designate these specific proposals in the amounts requested herein as emergency requirements. As I stated in my previous request, these additional requests will allow for a comprehensive response and recovery effort to address the critical needs associated with both of these hurricanes in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and other affected areas. I urge the Congress to limit this emergency request to those items directly related to the recovery efforts from the impact of these recent major disasters.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
