    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period from June 1 through July 31, 2001. The previous submission covered from April 1 through May 31, 2001.
The United Nations continued in its efforts to resume the proximity talks that started in December 1999. During the reporting period, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. Bandler continued to provide diplomatic support to this process. The United States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
