    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, House Majority Leader Alice Madden and 10 other legislators and community leaders. Former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb was named a national campaign co-chair.
"Hillary Clinton is the strongest candidate in an exceptionally talented field," said Speaker Romanoff. "She will bring courage to a job that demands it, new leadership to a nation that needs it, and real hope to a troubled world."
"From her commitment to establish universal health care to her plan to move America toward energy independence, Hillary Clinton has the ability to move this country toward a brighter future," said Majority Leader Madden.
"With so many great challenges facing us at home and abroad, this country needs Hillary Clinton's vision and leadership," Mayor Webb said. "Her 35 years of experience fighting for America's children and families make her uniquely qualified to be President."
"I'm honored to have the support of these distinguished leaders from across Colorado," Clinton said. "With their help, we will continue to grow our grassroots organization and bring our message of change throughout the nation."
