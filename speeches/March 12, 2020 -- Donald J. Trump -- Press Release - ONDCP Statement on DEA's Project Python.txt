Today, White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Jim Carroll released the following statement regarding the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Project Python.
"As part of the Administration's efforts to keep Americans safe from illegal drugs flowing into our communities, the DEA-led operation, Project Python, successfully targeted elements of Mexico's Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG). I commend the leadership and decisive action taken by Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski and Acting Administrator Dhillon along with the Department of Justice and its Federal law enforcement officials. This operation demonstrates a deep commitment to bringing ruthless cartels to justice and signifies this Administration's commitment to achieving our overall goal of saving lives", ONDCP Director Jim Carroll said.
