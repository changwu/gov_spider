    "President Trump's record of building the American economy to unprecedented heights before it was artificially interrupted by the global coronavirus pandemic is even more salient today. He is unquestionably the Jobs President and Americans will look to him and his proven success to restore the economy to greatness. President Trump is determined to open up the economy again and get us moving as soon as it is safely possible. He built the economy to historic strength and he will do it a second time. In stark contrast, Joe Biden presided over the slowest economic recovery since World War II and has promised to raise taxes and burden job creators with strangling regulations under the Green New Deal. He does nothing but sit in his basement and lob political hand grenades, serving up partisan pablum and mumbling incoherent criticisms designed to score points, not help. The choice for voters is clear: President Trump is the only one who has demonstrated that he knows how to get the economy fired up again."
