WH pool report #1 / Manchin and Carper read outs 
?Hey all.
I'm happy, pleased, and honored to be your pooler for the day.
The White House has passed along these read outs from yesterday's meetings:
Meeting with Senator Carper:President Biden always appreciates time with Senator Carper, with whom he's been working on behalf of the people of Delaware for decades. They had a productive conversation about the American Jobs Plan, and particularly the need for meaningful infrastructure investment.
Meeting with Senator Manchin: President Biden enjoyed speaking with Senator Manchin about the American Jobs Plan and their shared goal of rebuilding our country, especially when it comes to investing in rural communities.
Feel free to ping me with any questions or concerns.

WH pool report #6 / POTUS and governors
POTUS is meeting virtually with a bipartisan group of governors, scheduled to begin shortly. According to WH guidance, the event is being taped from the South Court Auditorium. It is closed to press and unavailable to your pooler, so alas, there will be no color to pass along from inside the room (from outside the room, I can report that your pooler has not yet spotted any cicadas from the edge of the White House lawn)
The meeting will be streamed here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
The WH briefing is slated to start sometime after the POTUS meeting with governors.
