    Thank you very much, Mayor Smith, Senator John Tower, Mr. Conger, all of you wonderful people of Waco:
Let me express my appreciation for the opportunity to be here on this very historic occasion and to see so many friendly and hospitable faces. It's just a great occasion, despite this Michigan weather--not Texas weather.
But it's nice to be here. And I am very proud of the fact that you in this great community have taken this fantastic bridge that I read a bit about before I got here--completed in 1870, a tremendous engineering project over 100 years ago--and to see it as we drove up and to be here as we stand now, I think, is a tribute to your forefathers, their vision, their foresight to have something like this over this great river, the Brazos River.
But now, let me say I want to compliment every one of you, because by seeing the beauty of this bridge and preserving it for future generations, making it a part of this great complex, you're developing out here--Indian Center Park, is it?--I think this generation of leaders, this generation of citizens in Waco deserve also congratulations and commendation.
So, I thank you for the chance to be here. I thank you, Mr. Mayor and Mr. Conger. I'm deeply grateful. Good luck, and God bless every one of you.
Thank you very much.
