    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Inslee (D) WA)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1690, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to eliminate Section 3(c), which directs the establishment of a Conservation Advisory Group. In the interest of making Government work more effectively and at less cost, the Administration urges the Congress to show restraint in creating new advisory committees â€” especially when such committees' charters are not national in scope.
