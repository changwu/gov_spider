    I am deeply saddened by the tragic death of Carlos Marin, a dedicated public servant who died while fulfilling his responsibilities as United States Commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico. Carlos Marin was an accomplished engineer and capable leader who achieved the American Dream while serving at the Commission for over two decades. He quickly rose through the ranks as he worked hard to effectively apply the boundary and water treaties between our country and Mexico. I appreciate his efforts to protect our Nation's interests, raise agency morale, and establish solid and transparent relationships with his Mexican counterparts. I am honored that he served in my administration.
My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Rosa Alva and the entire Marin family.
Mexican Commissioner Arturo Herrera, Jake Brisbin, Jr., and Matthew Peter Juneau were also killed in this tragic plane crash. Their families are also in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.
