WH Pool #14 Update on POTUS response to shouted questions 
At the end, you may have heard Fox's Peter Doocy shout to the President if he "underestimated Putin"...Some members of the pool say they saw POTUS (rhetorically) ask the officials who were participating in the supply chain event if they also underestimated Putin.
Your pool did not see the president's reaction, but it may have been captured on the live feed.
