    Gov. Perry picked up the endorsement of Iowa State Senator Rick Bertrand during a campaign stop in Sioux City, IA. From the Sioux City Journal:
During his introduction, Bertand told the standing-room-only crowd he liked Texas governor for three simple reasons.
- Perry has executive experience, serving as governor of the nation's second most populous state for the last decade.
"He can sit across the table from President Obama and talk about what he's going to do, he can talk about what he has done," Bertrand.
- A retired Air Force captain, Perry is the only candidate with military experience. Though the 2012 will focus heavily on jobs, Bertrand said national security will again be a top issue, with U.S. forces currently deployed in two wars.
"He has a great grasp of the importance of keeping our supremacy... expanding and growing the strength of America," Bertrand told the audience.
- Lastly, Bertrand said Perry makes him "feel good about America."
"It's that Ronald Reaganesque when I was in high school growing up," Bertrand told the audience. "It's that confidence and positive attitude. It's the same thing we talk about in Iowa and Sioux City, that we're very confident that better days are ahead of us."
