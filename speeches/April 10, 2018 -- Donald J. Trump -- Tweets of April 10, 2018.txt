Last night it was my great honor to host America's senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House. America's military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world. They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform! https://t.co/BjWKcMX0iLRetweets: 19515Favorites: 87735
