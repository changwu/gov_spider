LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul will return to California next week for three town hall meetings and other campaign activities. The congressman's visit will take place from Tuesday to Friday, May 1st to 4th, inclusive.
Dr. Paul will hold a private fundraiser on the night of his arrival, and the remainder of the visit will be a mix of media avails, fundraising luncheons, and on-campus town hall meetings. Public events will be held at Cal State — Fullerton, UC - Davis, and UC - San Diego. The latter events are free and open to the public. Due to the anticipated large crowds, online registration is offered and strongly encouraged.
The return visit follows the 12-term Congressman from Texas' early-April campaign swing in the Golden State. Dr. Paul's visits to Cal State - Chico, UCLA, and UC - Berkeley drew a remarkable 6,200-plus, 6,000-plus, and 8,500-plus supporters and undecided voters, respectively. Ron Paul's California town hall meetings featured some of the largest crowds of his 2012 race for the Republican nomination.
Ron Paul's college campus town hall meetings in California are being organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP). YFP, an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign, launched in September 2011, and since its inception, students nationwide have organized 621 chapters and recruited more than 90,000 people.
