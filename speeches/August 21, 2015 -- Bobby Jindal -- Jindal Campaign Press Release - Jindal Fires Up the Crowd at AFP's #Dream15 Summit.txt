Bobby Jindal isn't even done, and he's already gotten more energized applause and cheers than all the other speakers combined. #Dream15

Bush's reception at #Dream15 seemed pretty warm, until the standing ovation for Jindal lasted through 7,000 loops of Callin' Baton Rouge.

Governor Bobby Jindal literally mobbed by crowd to shake hands and take pics @afphq #Dream15

To say that Bobby Jindal is bringing it today & that the #Dream15 crowd is eating it up is the understatement of the century.
