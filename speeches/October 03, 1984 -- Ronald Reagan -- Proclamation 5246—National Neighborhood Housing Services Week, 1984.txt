  A Proclamation

America's neighborhoods, composed of individuals of diverse racial, ethnic, social, religious, and economic backgrounds, stand as a tribute to our Nation's democratic traditions and beliefs.
The preservation and improvement of the residential, commercial, and other facilities in neighborhoods throughout our country are essential to the strength of America's families and businesses. These have been and will continue to be the goals of the Neighborhood Housing Services programs.
Neighborhood Housing Services programs are partnerships of local residents, business leaders, and government officials. They have generated over two billion dollars in reinvestment funds to revitalize and preserve our country's neighborhoods. The success of these programs depends largely on the spirit of cooperation and voluntarism that is a hallmark of American life.
In recognition of those who have contributed their time, money, and energy to the preservation of our neighborhoods, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 566, has designated the week beginning October 7, 1984, as "National Neighborhood Housing Services Week" and has authorized and' requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 7, 1984, as National Neighborhood Housing Services Week, and I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe this week with appropriate activities and events.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.

RONALD REAGAN
