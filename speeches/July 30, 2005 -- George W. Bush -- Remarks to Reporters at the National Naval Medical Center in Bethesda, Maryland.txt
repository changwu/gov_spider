    President's Health/Visit With Marines
The President. I just finished two things. One, I had my physical, and I'm feeling pretty good. It's a great hospital to come to to get your physical.
But I also visited with some brave marines who have been wounded. It's a remarkable experience to meet with these incredibly courageous souls who keep their spirit. And I understand why they're serving the country. I met with their parents. I met with the healers who work here at Bethesda. It's aâ€”it's such a great credit to our country to have a place such as this.
So I want to thank you for having me, and thanks for giving me my physical.
Rear Adm. Robinson. You're welcome, sir.
The President. Thank you.
Q. How's your health, sir?
The President. She's going to put out the return. I think you'll find it's pretty good. Thank you.
