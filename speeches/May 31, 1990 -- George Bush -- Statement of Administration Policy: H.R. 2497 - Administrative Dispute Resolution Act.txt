    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Glickman (D) Kansas and Pease (D) Ohio)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2497. The Administration, however, will seek an amendment in the Senate to delete the provision authorizing the payment of attorneys' fees when an agency head vacates an arbitral award. It is premature to provide such fees before obtaining information concerning the frequency and circumstances of agency decisions to overturn arbitral awards.
