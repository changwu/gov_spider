    The President today announced his intention to nominate attorney Reed E. Hundt as a member of the Federal Communications Commission. Once Mr. Hundt is confirmed as a member, the President intends to designate him Chairman of the FCC.
"Telecommunications innovations are constantly changing the way we as Americans communicate with each other and with the word. With his years of experience, I am confident Reed Hundt will do an excellent job steering the FCC through the challenges it will face over the next 5 years," the President said.
