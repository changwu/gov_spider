In an economic policy speech in Florida today, Marco laid out his vision for undoing the damage President Obama has done to our economy, and restoring the American Dream.

One of the key points he made:
Republicans know that lower taxes are key to economic growth. That was one of the key lessons of the Reagan years, when lower taxes unleashed an incredible economic boom.
Marco Rubio: No new taxes of any kind. Any new tax does not lead to economic growth. #WTSP pic.twitter.com/p1xVPWQvvo

But not all Republicans running for President this year, Marco pointed out, oppose all new taxes on the American people. 
In fact, some of them support a European-style Value-Added Tax, a huge new tax on the American people that liberals have sought for decades, and that Ronald Reagan vehemently opposed.
Rubio: "Believe it or not, multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people."

In economic speech, Rubio hits Republicans who support what he dubs "intentionally sneaky" Value Added Tax (i.e. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul).

Rubio: Some R candidates support "imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against, called a Value Added Tax."

A VAT would grow the federal government while concealing the costs to the American people.
A few other candidates also support a new Internet sales tax — which will hammer small businesses and get in the way of letting a New American economy flourish.
Marco stands against all new taxes — and for a free economy in the 21st century. Read the whole speech here.
