    Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum made the following statement in response to President Obama's budget proposal.
Rick Santorum said: "The American people have spoken loudly for the past three years, demanding fiscal responsibility from our leaders and President Obama is either deaf or simply won't listen. Today's proposal of nearly $4 trillion in spending over the next year is preposterous, not only in overall funding but in priorities. If we do not get our spending under control, we will have turmoil in the streets - and that's not a guess - all you have to do is look to Europe. America needs to lead, and America needs a leader prepared to make those tough choices. I am committed to balancing our budget and cutting $5 trillion in spending in five years. These are the measures necessary to not just put our nation's fiscal house in order, but to spur on economic growth and confidence in our free-market system."
