    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(SENT 6/27/94)(Markey (D) MA and 43 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3636.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3636 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
