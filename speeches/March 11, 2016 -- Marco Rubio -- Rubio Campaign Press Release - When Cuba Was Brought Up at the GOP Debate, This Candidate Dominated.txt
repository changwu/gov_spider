One exchange will be talked about all across Florida after tonight's CNN debate: Marco completely owning the issue of Cuba.
While Marco offered a clear and competent way to deal with Cuba, Trump had no answer at all.

The response across the web? Incredible:
On Cuba, Marco Rubio just showed Donald Trump why knowledge of policy and substance matters.

The contrast between Rubio's fluency on the Cuba issue vs. Trump's was quite stark.

Rubio is crushing Trump on Cuba.

Marco has a clear, substantive plan for dealing with Cuba, and it starts with supporting democracy and human rights on the island.Tonight's exchange proves that Marco's ready to lead on day one — Donald Trump talks about "good deals," Marco knows what they actually look like on the global stage.
