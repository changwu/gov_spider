In August 2007, Governor Romney Proposed Cutting Back Federal Funds From Cities That Ignore Federal Immigration Laws:
Governor Romney Says Cities That Refuse To Comply With Federal Immigration Laws Should Not Receive Some Federal Funds. "'There are some cities in this country that have said, we're calling ourselves a sanctuary city, we're going to call ourselves a city where our city employees will not look into someone's illegal status, will not notify the federal government that someone's here illegally,' Romney told more than 100 central Iowans in Urbandale this morning. 'We send hundreds of millions of dollars to these cities, even billions of dollars, from the federal government,' the former Massachusetts governor said during a question-and-answer session at the Iowa Machine Shed restaurant. 'We ought to stop doing that.'" (Thomas Beaumont, "Romney: Cut Aid Of Illegal Immigrant Havens," Des Moines Register, 8/2/07)
- Governor Romney "Would Move To Deny Some Federal Money To Cities Which Declare Themselves 'Sanctuaries' For Illegal Immigrants." "In answer to a question about immigration, Romney said as president he would move to deny some federal money to cities which declare themselves 'sanctuaries' for illegal immigrants. Romney told the crowd that 'irks' him. 'We send hundreds of millions of dollars to these cities – even billions of dollars – from the federal government,' Romney said. 'We ought to stop doing that.'" (O.Kay Henderson, "Romney 'Disappointed' By Ethical Lapses," Radio Iowa, 8/2/07)

Governor Romney: It "Is Simply Wrong" For Sanctuary Cities To Ignore The Law. "Romney received loud applause when he blasted cities that openly proclaim they will not pursue deportation of illegal immigrants. He said such 'sanctuary cities' ignore the law. 'That is simply wrong. We've got to stop that,' he said. He added that he sees a clear distinction between legal and illegal immigration and rejected calls to close the border." (Matt Milner, "Romney Fires At Democrat Rivals," Ottumwa Courier, 7/28/07)
Unlike Other Republican Candidates, Governor Romney Does Not Support Sanctuary City Policies And Opposes Amnesty. GOVERNOR ROMNEY: "But at the same time, New York City was a sanctuary city. The mayor said, 'Look, if you happen to be illegal, we want you in New York City.' That's exactly the wrong kind of message to send in my view. And I think we ought to cut off some funding – federal funding to cities that call themselves sanctuary cities, that welcome people into their cities who are illegal and who provide benefits to individuals – other than, of course, emergency health care and education." (Fox News' "Fox & Friends," 8/9/07)
FACT: In Massachusetts, Governor Romney Took Action To Combat Illegal Immigration:
In December 2006, Governor Romney Signed A Memorandum Of Agreement With The Federal Government Deputizing State Troopers To Enforce Immigration Laws. "Governor Mitt Romney and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Assistant Secretary Julie L. Myers today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and ICE, which will give specially trained Massachusetts State Troopers the authority to administer and enforce federal immigration laws in the Commonwealth." (Office Of The Governor, "Governor Romney, ICE Sign Immigration Enforcement Pact," Press Release, 12/13/06)
Governor Romney Vetoed In-State Tuition For Illegal Immigrants. "Romney also vetoed a number of outside sections of the budget, including: ... A plan that would have permitted illegal aliens to pay the same in-state tuition rate at our public colleges and universities as Massachusetts citizens." (Office Of The Governor, "Romney Signs $22.402B Fiscal Year 2005 'No New Tax' Budget," Press Release, 6/25/04)
- Governor Romney: In-State Tuition For Illegal Immigrants "Would Be A Mistake" Conflicting With Federal Law. "Mr. Romney said he was not prepared to provide 'special benefits' to illegal immigrants in the state. 'Our desire is to help legal immigrants,' he said. 'I do not believe that, out of respect for the law, that we can provide special benefits to illegal immigrants. We have a responsibility to uphold the law, and providing special benefits to those who are here in contravention of the national law, in my view, would be a mistake.'" (John J. Monahan, "Immigrant Tuition Bill Defeated," Telegram & Gazette, 1/12/06)
Governor Romney Opposed The Issuance Of Drivers' Licenses To Illegal Immigrants. "'Those who are here illegally should not receive tacit support from our government that gives an indication of legitimacy,' the governor said, echoing arguments that opponents have voiced in the Commonwealth and in other states considering similar license measures. 'If they are here illegally, they should not get driver's licenses,' he said." (Scott S. Greenberger, "Romney Stand Dims Chances Of License For Undocumented," The Boston Globe, 10/28/03)
