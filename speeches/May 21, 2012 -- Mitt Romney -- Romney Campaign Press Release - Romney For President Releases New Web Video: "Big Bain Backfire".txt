    Today, Romney for President released a new web video titled "Big Bain Backfire." President Obama's attacks on free enterprise have triggered a backlash among manyâ€”even among those in his own party. In just the past few days, everyone from former advisors to his own surrogates have criticized the Obama campaign's attack on free enterprise. With no record to run on, it is no surprise that the Obama campaign has resorted to misleading attacks that have been disavowed by its own supporters.
