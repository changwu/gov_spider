    I commend the House of Representatives for acting quickly to approve funds for our continued effort to strengthen homeland security and protect the American people. I'm particularly pleased that the House bill supports my request to help train, equip, and prepare first-responders across our Nation. The bill also supports important core functions of the newly created Department of Homeland Security, including border security, infrastructure protection, and information analysis.
