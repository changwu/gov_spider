    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA and Madigan (R) IL)
The Administration does not object to enactment of H.R. 5155. This bill would authorize appropriations of $13 million for FY 1989, and such sums as may be necessary for FYs 1990 and 1991, for activities under the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally 111 Individuals Act of 1986.
The Administration believes that protection and advocacy systems for the mentally ill are essentially a State-local responsibility, and these systems should look to State and local governments for financial support. Accordingly, the Administration supports a phaseout of Federal appropriations for these systems over FYs 1990 and 1991.
