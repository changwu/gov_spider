    I commend the House of Representatives for passing today the bipartisan new markets, empowerment zone, and community renewal legislation. At a time of unprecedented prosperity, too many Americans in our cities and rural areas still do not have access to investment capital and economic opportunity. This legislation will spur more private sector investment in these new markets so that all Americans can fully participate in our thriving economy. I look forward to working with Members of both parties in the House and the Senate this year to enact this historic and innovative legislation.
