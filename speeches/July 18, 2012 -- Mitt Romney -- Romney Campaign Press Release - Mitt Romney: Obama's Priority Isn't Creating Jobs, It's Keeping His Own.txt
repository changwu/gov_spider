    "[Y]ou would think the President would focus all of his energy and his passion on helping people get jobs. But you know what he's been doing over the last six months? In the last six months, he has held 100 fundraisers. And guess how many meetings he's had with his Jobs Council? None. Zero. Zero, in the last six months. So it makes it very clear where his priorities are. His priority is not creating jobs for you, his priority is trying to keep his own job and that's why he's going to lose it." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Today the National Federation of Independent Businesses, NFIB, they announced a study they'd carried out. They talked to their members and had some economists trying to understand what would happen if the President's tax policies actually were enacted because his tax policy is to take the tax on small business from 35 percent to 40 percent. I say that because most small businesses are taxed as individuals and he wants to raise the marginal tax rate from 35 to 40 percent and the NFIB came back with a number. They said if that policy gets put in place, it will kill 710,000 jobs. That's the direction of this President. And there's something else, I think, that you ought to know. And that is when something's in trouble, when people need good jobs, you would think the President would focus all of his energy and his passion on helping people get jobs. But you know what he's been doing over the last six months? In the last six months, he has held 100 fundraisers. And guess how many meetings he's had with his Jobs Council? None. Zero. Zero, in the last six months. So it makes it very clear where his priorities are. His priority is not creating jobs for you, his priority is trying to keep his own job and that's why he's going to lose it."
