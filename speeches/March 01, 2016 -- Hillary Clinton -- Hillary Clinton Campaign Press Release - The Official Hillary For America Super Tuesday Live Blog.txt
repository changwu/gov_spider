Hillary Clinton just delivered remarks in Miami.



  " ... We know we've got work to do. But that work is not to make America great again—America never stopped being great. We have to make America whole. We have to fill in what's been hollowed out. We have to make strong the broken places. Re-stitch bonds of trust and respect across our country. Now, it might be unusual—as I've said before—for a presidential candidate to say this, but I'm going to keep saying it: I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness. "


  " ... There is no doubt in my mind that America's best years are ahead of us. We have got to believe that. We've got to work for that. We have to stand with each other. We have to lift each other up. And never stop believing in the future."

A little inspiration from on the ground.
At field offices across the country, volunteers are making last-minute calls to Hillary supporters in Super Tuesday states. (Click here to help make calls from wherever you are!)


Kevin (bottom right) and other Hillary volunteers in Georgia.
Kevin from Georgia is one of them. He recently wrote Hillary a beautiful letter about his new baby, his hopes and dreams for his family, and why he's counting on her to win. And today he's doing everything he can to help her do it.


Kevin's new baby, Grey.

Want to help Hillary Clinton win today? Time to hop on the phone.

Today's a HUGE day for our campaign—Super Tuesday wins will go a long way toward helping Hillary Clinton secure the nomination.
With 800+ delegates on the line, we've got to do everything we can to get Hillary supporters out there to make their voices heard.
Even in a digital world, the most effective way to make sure our supporters turn out (besides knocking on their doors) is by calling them on the phone—old-school style.
Can you make a few calls for Hillary today? We'll be calling into 11 of the states holding contests—Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
You don't even need a phone—you just need to click here.?And don't worry if you've never done this before—we'll walk you through everything you need.
Let's do this!

Delegates 101: Why Super Tuesday is so super
Democrats are voting or caucusing today in 12 contests—11 states, plus the territory of American Samoa.
Across these contests, there are more than 800 delegates up for grabs—more than on any other day single day in the presidential primary. For comparison's sake, there were 156 delegates at stake in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina combined.?
What is a delegate, anyway?
Democratic delegates will represent the party at its national convention this summer. When primary voters and caucus-goers go to the polls, they're actually choosing which candidate to pledge delegates to—and the candidate with the majority of delegates at the convention will become the Democratic presidential nominee.
There are 4,051 pledged delegates up for grabs in this year's Democratic primary—with a specific number awarded in every caucus and primary. Delegates in Democratic caucuses and primaries are awarded based on how much support each candidate receives.
Right now—after the first four contests—Hillary Clinton is winning the pledged delegate count with 91 delegates. Senator Bernie Sanders has 65.
So what happens today?
At the end of Super Tuesday, about a quarter of pledged delegates will have been awarded. Here's the breakdown of the delegates at stake today:


We'll be keeping tabs on the delegate count as results come in tonight! Make sure to check back for updates.
