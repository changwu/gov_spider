    The United States condemns today's second round of nuclear tests by Pakistan. These tests can only serve to increase tensions in an already volatile region. With their recent tests, Pakistan and India are contributing to a self-defeating cycle of escalation that does not add to the security of either country. Both India and Pakistan need to renounce further nuclear and missile testing immediately and take decisive steps to reverse this dangerous arms race.
I will continue to work with leaders throughout the international community to reduce tensions in south Asia, to preserve the global consensus on nonproliferation.
I call on India and Pakistan to resume their direct dialog, to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty immediately and without conditions to reverse the arms race there, and to join the clear international consensus in support of nonproliferation.
