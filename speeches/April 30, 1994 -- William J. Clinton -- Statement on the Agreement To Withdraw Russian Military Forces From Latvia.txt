    I applaud today's agreement signed by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and Russian President Boris Yeltsin that will lead to the withdrawal of Russian military forces from the territory of the Republic of Latvia by August 31, 1994. I have contacted both leaders to offer my personal congratulations for their vision and statesmanship in concluding this historic accord.
Since the early days of my administration, among my highest foreign policy priorities has been promoting agreement on an orderly withdrawal of Russian forces from the Baltic countries. I discussed this frequently with President Yeltsin and President Ulmanis. The United States has played an active role with both parties during the course of the Latvian-Russian negotiations. I believe that our engagement with both sides, along with the support provided by other countries, in particular Sweden, has played a constructive role in bringing this agreement to a successful conclusion.
Over the course of their negotiations, both the Latvian and Russian Governments displayed a pragmatic approach to resolving their differences. The understandings that this document embodies, including the continued operation of the radar installation at Skrunda as a civilian facility, are testimony to the determination of both sides to conclude an agreement that responds to Russian concerns while affirming Latvia's full and unrestricted sovereignty and promoting its integration into the world community.
The agreement between Latvia and Russia now opens the door to a more normal relationship between the two countries. It constitutes an important contribution to overall stability in the Baltic region and to European security as a whole. I hope that this agreement also will help stimulate a speedy conclusion of the troop withdrawal negotiations between Estonia and Russia.
