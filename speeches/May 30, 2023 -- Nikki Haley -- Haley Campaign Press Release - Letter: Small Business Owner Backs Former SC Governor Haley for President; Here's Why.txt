As the owner of a small business, I want a president who will cut the red tape, gut regulations, and look out for the little guy.
I know Nikki Haley will do that as president because I watched her do it as governor. During her tenure, she turned South Carolina into the "Beast of the Southeast" and made our state an economic powerhouse. She brought big companies to South Carolina, creating thousands of jobs, while allowing small businesses to flourish.
As president, I am confident she will restore America's fiscal sanity.
