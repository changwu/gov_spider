    Jill and I send our warmest greetings to Muslims across the United States and around the world celebrating Eid al-Adha. The Eid traditions and Hajj rituals that commemorate the devotion of Abraham and his son to God are an opportunity for Muslims to renew their faith and a reminder of the common roots of the world's great Abrahamic religions. And the act of sharing the sacrifice with those less fortunate in service of God mirrors our common commitment to work together to meet the challenges of our world today.
While COVID-19 restrictions remain, Muslims draped in white will be able to gather from around the world for the first time in 2 years to perform the Hajj. It's a symbol of the progress we have made in fighting this pandemic and of all work we must still do to strengthen our recovery. Let us all take this opportunity to renew our shared commitment to work for peace, care for the vulnerable, and pursue greater equality and opportunity for all people.
Here in the United States, Muslim Americans are leading on the front lines, together with members of all faith communities, to assist those suffering from hunger and conflict, at home and abroad. To all those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a joyous holiday filled with community, celebration, compassion, and service. Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabroor!
