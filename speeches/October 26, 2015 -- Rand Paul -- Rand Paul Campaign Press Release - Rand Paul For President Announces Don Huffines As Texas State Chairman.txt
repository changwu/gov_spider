"Strong conservative leadership runs in Senator Rand Paul's veins," said Senator Don Huffines. "He is a true constitutional conservative who speaks his mind, and Americans trust him and value his principled, direct leadership. Senator Paul knows that Americans needs limited government, the freedom to pursue happiness, and liberty without oppression, and he is the best candidate to deliver America to even greater glory. He is providing a vision for all Americans of a free nation, with less government, and more liberty. He is unapologetically principled in his beliefs about limiting government and advancing freedom and liberty for Americans, and I am proud to help him become our next President."
