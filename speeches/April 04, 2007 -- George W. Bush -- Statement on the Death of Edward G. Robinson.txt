    Laura and I are saddened to learn of the death of Eddie Robinson. Eddie Robinson was a football legend who compiled an amazing record as the coach at Grambling State University. He will be remembered for his passion for the game and his dedication to helping his players better themselves on the field, in the classroom, and in their communities. Laura and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Robinson family, the players he inspired, and Grambling State University.
