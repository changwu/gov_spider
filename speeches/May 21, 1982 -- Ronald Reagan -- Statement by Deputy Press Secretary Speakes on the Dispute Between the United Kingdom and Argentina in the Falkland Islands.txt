    The President and this administration have been intensely involved in the search for peace since the beginning of the dispute in the South Atlantic. Our deep concern over the threat of conflict has been evident to the international community. We have made bilateral and multilateral efforts in support of that effort. We continue today to be in contact with those at the United Nations and elsewhere who are also striving for a peaceful solution under U.N. Security Council Resolution 502 and the U.N. Charter.
Let me emphasize, there will be no involvement whatsoever of U.S. military personnel in the conflict in the South Atlantic. As the President and Secretary Haig have said, we will meet our commitments to Great Britain. Any responses made to requests for assistance will be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. We will, however, not address reports of specific requests for assistance or how we respond.
Our position throughout this dispute has been to do whatever we can to advance the chances for a peaceful resolution, and that remains our stance. Every step, every action of the President and the United States Government shall be taken with one thought in mindâ€”a peaceful solution. We stand ready to assist in any way we can.
