    My dear Governor:
I am enclosing a copy of a letter to me from Mr. James A. Moffett, the Administrator of the Federal Housing Administration. This letter calls my attention to the need for certain legislation to make Titles II and III of the National Housing Act more effective.
Amendments to existing State laws seem to be called for in practically every State—forty-four of them—in which State Legislatures are meeting this winter.
Mr. Moffett tells me that the bill passed by the Legislature of the State of New York, in Special Session last August, seems to meet the general needs. I am enclosing a copy of this bill.
It would give me great satisfaction if you would give this matter your most careful consideration with the object, if you approve, of obtaining legislation in your State in 1935.
If you would care to have any further information in regard to the details or objects relating to this subject, I shall be glad to have you call on Mr. Moffett at any time.
Very sincerely yours,
