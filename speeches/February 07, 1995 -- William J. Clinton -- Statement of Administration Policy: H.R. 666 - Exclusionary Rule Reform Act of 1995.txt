    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(McCollum (R) FL)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 666 if it is amended to apply the "good faith" exception to the search-and-seizure exclusionary rule only when a search warrant has been obtained.
With this modification H.R. 666 would be consistent with the current prevailing approach of most courts and State legislatures which have not recognized a "good faith" exception for non-warrant cases. This approach would provide an appropriate incentive for officers to obtain warrants before carrying out searches and seizures.
