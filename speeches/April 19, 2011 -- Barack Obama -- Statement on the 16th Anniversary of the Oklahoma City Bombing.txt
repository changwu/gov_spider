    Sixteen years ago today, America witnessed a horrific attack in Oklahoma City, killing more than 160 men, women, and children and wounding hundreds of others. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the families and friends who lost a loved one and suffered through this tragic event. We also need to remember the resilience and toughness of the American people and know that our Nation's resolve to fight terror and combat violent extremism in all its forms will not waver. As a nation, we should take a moment to recognize the courage and spirit of our fellow citizens, the first-responders who rushed to the site to save countless lives, and the people of the Nation, who stood together to lift up this tight-knit community. Our thoughts and prayers are never far from those who lost their lives 16 years ago.
