Joe Biden would be the worst person to put in charge of America's economy right now - having led the slowest economic "recovery" since the Great Depression
In the last five months, the economy has recovered 50 percent of all jobs lost due to the pandemic, something that took Joe Biden two and a half years to do
The unemployment rate has nearly been cut in half since April; it took five and a half years for Biden's "recovery" to achieve the same reduction in unemployment

The Biden-led "recovery" failed American workers, families, and businesses
Biden's "recovery" lost 192,000 manufacturing jobs, created stagnant wage growth, saw 800,000 Americans fall into poverty, and left the middle class behind

"The labor market is expected to improve after the third quarter, with a rebound in hiring and a significant reduction in furloughs as the degree of social distancing diminishes—leading to an increase in business activity and an increase in the demand for workers. In particular, the unemployment rate is projected to decline to 9.5 percent by the end of 2021. Under that projection, the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 would be about 6 percentage points higher than the rate in CBO's economic projection produced in January 2020, and the labor force would have about 6 million fewer people."

In early 2015, 120.8 million adults were in middle-income households, compared with 121.3 million in lower- and upper-income households combined, a demographic shift that could signal a tipping point, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data."

A December 2015 Gallup Survey Found That Only 51 Percent Of U.S. Adults Identify As Middle-Class, Down From 63 Percent Of Those Polled In 2008. "A Gallup survey this spring showed that just 51% of U.S. adults considered themselves middle or upper middle class, with 48% saying they are part of the lower or working class.

At A Time When Businesses And Workers Were Struggling, The Obama-Biden Administration Unleashed A Flood Of New Regulations At A Cost Of $743 Billion
An August 2016 Analysis By The American Action Forum (AAF) Showed That The Obama-Biden Administration Had Issued 600 Major Regulations, "20 Percent More Than" Under The Bush Administration. "Now, the administration has once again reached another record-breaking figure: 600 major regulations in roughly 7.5 years, which is 20 percent more than the previous president did in eight years." (Sam Batkins, "600 Major Regulations," American Action Forum, 8/6/16)
Obama-Biden's 600 Major Regulations Came At A Cost of "At Least $743 Billion." "What is the economic burden from these 600 major regulations? According to American Action Forum (AAF) research, based on data provided by agencies, it's at least $743 billion (including deregulatory measures) and 194 million paperwork burden hours (President Bush issued roughly $2 billion in major rules in 2009). To put those figures in perspective, $743 billion is larger than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Norway and Israel combined." (Sam Batkins, "600 Major Regulations," American Action Forum, 8/6/16)

Obama-Biden's 600 Major Regulations Amounted To "A $2,294 Regulatory Imposition On Every Person In The United States." "It is a $2,294 regulatory imposition on every person in the United States. In the equivalent amount of time to complete 194 million additional hours of paperwork, it would take 97,429 employees working full-time (2,000 hours a year) to comply with these new federal requirements. That's roughly the population of Albany, NY working full-time filling out government forms." (Sam Batkins, "600 Major Regulations," American Action Forum, 8/6/16)
