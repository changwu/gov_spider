- Detroit News's Brian J. O'Connor: "Four years into what local economists call 'a one-state recession,' Michigan's damaged economy should be bottoming out in the next year or so, economists say. Already the state boasts some of the highest unemployment and foreclosure rates in the nation and is seeing its population dwindle as residents quit the state to find work elsewhere." (Brian J. O'Connor, "Economic Pain Will Get Even Worse," The Detroit News, 11/2/07)

- Governor Romney Wants To Ensure Government Invests In Research Wisely. "I'd like to make sure that we review how government invests our research dollars, because I want to see more research dollars going into power generation, fuel technology, materials science.

(Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, MI, 2/7/07)
