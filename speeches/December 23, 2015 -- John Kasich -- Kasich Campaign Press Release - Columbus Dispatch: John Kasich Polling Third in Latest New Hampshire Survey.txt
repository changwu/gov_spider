John Kasich polling third in latest New Hampshire survey
By Darrell Rowland
Although it may not be one of the mainstream polls, a New Hampshire firm's survey shows that Ohio Gov. John Kasich has moved into third place in the state holding America's first presidential primary in less than seven weeks.
Kasich gets 13 percent in an American Research Group poll of likely primary voters, behind only Donald Trump (21 percent) and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (15).
Right behind the Ohio governor are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (12 percent) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (10 percent).
A third-place finish undoubtedly would be celebrated by the Kasich campaign — especially if they topped fellow "establishment lane" stalwarts Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who receives only 7 percent. Kasich was sixth in two other recently released polls of the Granite State, although several of the contenders are jumbled in the middle of the pack.
Among only Republican voters in today's poll, Kasich ties Trump for second, a single point behind Rubio.
Kasich also is tied for second, with Rubio four points behind Trump, among voters say they are most likely to actually vote.
Just 16 percent of New Hampshire voters say they never would vote for Kasich, while 57 rule Trump out.
The survey of a random sample of 600 likely Republican primary voters (329 Republicans and 271 independents) via landline and cell phone Sunday through Tuesday has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
