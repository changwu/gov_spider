    THE PRESIDENT [in reply to a question by Jimmy Carrick concerning the President's giving the first pint of blood].
I think you will find that the blood of a 68-year-old man is not fit for the boys. I would be perfectly willing to do it, but then I think if you consult the doctors in charge of this thing, they want young blood.
You have done a great thing. I understand that you have managed to collect 8,000 pints of blood--sent 40,000 letters to the soldiers and people who are out of the country and in the field. That is a great example. I wish every one of us would get that same habit, because that would contribute greatly to the ease of continuing our defense program on the basis on which it ought to be.
I congratulate you.
