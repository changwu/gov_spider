    Today, Biden for President released a new national ad featuring renowned actor and producer Samuel L. Jackson in a direct address to Americans about voter suppression through the years, and encouraging Americans to exercise their right to go vote this Fall.
"Same Old" begins airing today on television, radio, and digital outlets across the country and uses powerful archival content of Black voters and iconic Black leaders, including Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President Barack Obama, to supplement Jackson's call to action.

"If your vote didn't matter, they wouldn't try so hard to take it from you," Jackson said during the 60-second ad, before indirectly acknowledging Donald Trump. "I'm exercising my right to vote, and you should too. Not because I want you to - but because he doesn't."
This latest ad is part of a robust campaign push nationally and in key battleground states to educate and energize Black voters. The ad will air on national cable as well as in a total of 16 states of where the campaign's paid media program is active in designated markets â€” including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
