The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.Retweets: 15957Favorites: 68324

The same people that got us into the Middle East Quicksand 8 Trillion Dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side) are now fighting to keep us there. Don't listen to people that haven't got a clue. They have proven to be inept!Retweets: 23416Favorites: 90571

The Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. Big upset! Now @EddieRispone who will be a great Governor will win!Retweets: 18899Favorites: 69945

Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?Retweets: 19921Favorites: 81196

Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq who we just fought for. I said no and the Kurds left the fight twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey......Retweets: 18177Favorites: 77078

.....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!Retweets: 14601Favorites: 62729

Dealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress including Democrats about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!Retweets: 15101Favorites: 57014

The Democrats are going to lose a lot of House Seats because of their Fraudulent use of Impeachment. Schiff fabricated phone call a crime. Democrat Senate Seats will also be put at risk even some that were supposedly safe. Look at Louisiana last night North Carolina last week!Retweets: 19451Favorites: 73634

My deal with China is that they will IMMEDIATELY start buying very large quantities of our Agricultural Product not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks. THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED! Likewise financial services and other deal aspects start preparing....Retweets: 16841Favorites: 72590

....I agreed not to increase Tariffs from 25% to 30% on October 15th. They will remain at 25%. The relationship with China is very good. We will finish out the large Phase One part of the deal then head directly into Phase Two. The Phase One Deal can be finalized & signed soon!Retweets: 12393Favorites: 53140
