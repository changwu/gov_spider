    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Shays (R) Connecticut and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 513, which amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to clarify when "527" organizations must register as political committees. The President has repeatedly called for an end to abuses of the Nation's campaign finance system through the use of 527 organizations. H.R. 513 will make it clear that 527 organizations must abide by the same Federal campaign finance regulations as all other persons and organizations seeking to influence Federal elections. This bipartisan legislation accomplishes this objective by making explicit that fundraising and spending limits and disclosure obligations enacted in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 are applicable to these groups. The Administration also supports repealing the limits on expenditures coordinated between party committees and their candidates. The Administration supports the bill's exemption for the advocacy work of groups not engaged in Federal election activities. The Administration applauds this effort to create fair campaign finance rules and a level playing field for all groups and committees engaged in campaigning for Federal candidates, consistent with the First Amendment.
