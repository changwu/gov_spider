    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Glenn (D) OH and 7 others)
The Administration strongly supports S. 1587. This essential legislation will help implement one of the most important recommendations of the vice President's National Performance Review â€” to bring Federal procurement laws up to date and eliminate overly rigid bureaucratic procedures.
Enactment of this legislation will help achieve substantial savings to the Federal Government, both by making possible the downsizing of the procurement workforce and by increasing the Government's ability to buy less-expensive commercial products.
The Administration intends to work in conference to address a number of concerns (e.g., relating to requirements for fast pay under the simplified acquisition threshold), especially those developing during the final stage of committee consideration of S. 1587.
