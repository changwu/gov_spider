    In my State of the Union Address, I pledged to help any State to reform its welfare system by making it easier to obtain waivers of Federal law and regulation. I am pleased that we have approved Federal waivers that will allow New Jersey to implement its welfare reforms. These waivers will allow New Jersey to try a new approach to helping welfare dependent families become independent.
New Jersey's approach, called the Family Development Program, will encourage responsible behavior by parents receiving welfare. It will also offer incentives for such parents to work.
New ideas for reforming welfare abound in the States. I am pleased New Jersey will be one of the "laboratories of democracy" for welfare reform. Careful efforts to try new ideas and evaluate how well they work can help us create a better welfare system. New Jersey's efforts today will make for smarter policy tomorrow.
