    "One day after President Obama said ISIS cannot be defeated with guns, but instead with 'better ideas,' he announced his intention to shrink the Army by 40,000 troops. This is gravely concerning." -Bobby Jindal 07/08/15
America's stature in the world has drastically diminished. Unfriendly nations push the Obama Administration around, and the President himself will not call out the radical Islamist enemies we face. We need to restore America to a place where our enemies fear us and our friends trust us. Sign the petition if you think a stronger America is a safer America.
