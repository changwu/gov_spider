MANCHESTER, NH -- Governor Bill Richardson has moved past John Edwards into the top tier of Democratic Presidential primary candidates in New Hampshire according to the latest CNN/WMUR-TV poll released today.
"Voters are learning who Bill Richardson is and are hearing his message and we're very pleased with the position and momentum of the campaign," said Dave Contarino, Governor Richardson's campaign manager.

The poll was conducted July 9-17 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center and has a margin of error of +5.5%.
"The polls reflect what we have believed all along- voters are taking their time getting to know the candidates and where they stand on the important issues," added Contarino. "We're confident that as people hear about the Governor's plan to get the US out of Iraq with no residual troops, his innovative and detailed plan to provide universal health care to all Americans without raising taxes, and his bold initiative to fight global warming and make the US energy independent Bill Richardson will continue to move up."
