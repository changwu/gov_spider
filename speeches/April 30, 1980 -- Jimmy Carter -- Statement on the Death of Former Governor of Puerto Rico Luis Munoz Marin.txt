    All the people of the United States join me in expressing to the people of Puerto Rico our deep sorrow upon the death of one of Puerto Rico's great leaders and first elected Governor, Luis Munoz Marin.
As a poet, writer, and editor, he was an accomplished contributor to our knowledge and understanding. As a political leader, he marched in the first rank of the 20th-century leaders.
In his efforts to improve the living conditions of the poor and the disadvantaged in Puerto Rico, Munoz Marin opened the way for many of the most innovative programs of social and economic aid. He was joined in these efforts by other distinguished leaders in our hemisphere, and with them, he not only improved relations between the United States and Latin America but greatly advanced the struggle to strengthen democracy throughout Latin America.
His death leaves us without one of the great leaders of democracy in the world. The United States awarded him the Medal of Freedom in recognition of the contributions of this great man. His people and the people of the United States will keep his memory alive as an inspiration to keep striving for equality and justice for all.
