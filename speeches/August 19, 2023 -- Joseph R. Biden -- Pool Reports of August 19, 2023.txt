Out of town pool report #2 — POTUS on the move
The pool joined Biden’s motorcade at 4:52 pm local time. We did not see POTUS because we were staged far from the house where he is staying.
No official word on our destination.
Earlier, the pool left the press hotel at about 3 pm and drove roughly 15 minutes to the private residence where POTUS is staying. We were then swept by Secret Service.

Out of town pool report #3 — church
At 5:02 pm local time, we arrived at Our Lady of Tahoe Catholic Church. We didn’t see POTUS enter the church.
Pool is currently holding in the vans.
The ride took us along the scenic road that rings Lake Tahoe, with views of the lake and the lush trees. It was drizzling earlier this afternoon, but it’s sunny and in the low 70s now. Several groups of people along the way were snapped photos of the motorcade.

Out of town pool report #4 — Biden leaves church
POTUS, in a blue blazer, exited the church at 5:49 pm. He walked to his waiting SUV. He did not address the pool. As he was getting into the SUV, he waved to a nearby crowd and said, "Thank you."
Pool then rushed to our bus and the motorcade was rolling at 5:50 pm.

Out of town pool report #5 — lid
At 6:01, the pool peeled off from the motorcade as Biden continued on to the house where he’s staying. Pool did not see POTUS and we did not see the house.
We have a lid
One other note: POTUS exited church alone and did not appear to be accompanied by any of the family members that are here for his vacation.
