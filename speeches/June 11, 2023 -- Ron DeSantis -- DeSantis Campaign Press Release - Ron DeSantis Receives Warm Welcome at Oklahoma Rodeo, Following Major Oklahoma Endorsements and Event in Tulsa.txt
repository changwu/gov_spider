    The DeSantis Family Joined the Stitt Family in Ponca City for Military Appreciation Night at 101 Wild West Rodeo
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey DeSantis, and their children, Madison (6), Mason (5), and Mamie DeSantis (3), joined Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and his family at the 101 Wild West Rodeo for Military Appreciation Night. Governor DeSantis received a warm welcome from the crowd as he delivered remarks.
"Hello, Oklahoma, it's great to be with you! Greetings from the Free State of Florida. We appreciate what you do here. I tell you in Florida we do a lot of the same things, we trust in God, we support our police, we support the military, we stand for Second Amendment rights, we stand for strong borders, and we know we need to make sure that that goes coast to coast in this country. And that's what we're gonna do," Governor DeSantis said. "Freedom is one generation away from extinction, President Reagan told us, it's not passed along in the bloodstream. You need people who wear the uniform like we saw today to defend freedom, but we also need us as citizens to do our part. So that's what we're going to be doing over these next 18 months. Look forward to seeing you all over that and we will turn this country around. You mark my words. God bless everybody and thank you."
