    
ROCHESTER, Minn. â€“ Bernie Sanders on Saturday brought his campaign for the White House from big rallies in Texas to a spirited meeting here in Minnesota, both states where the Democratic nomination contest shifts into high gear in just three days.
"We love you Bernie," supporters yelled from the audience as he strode onto a stage at the Mayo Civic Center. He spoke out about the rigged economy, declining wages and growing gaps in wealth and income. "Together we are going to create an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent," Sanders told the crowd of 2,600.
Sanders arrived here as Saturdays ballots in South Carolina were being counted. "I congratulate Secretary Clinton on her very strong victory," he told reporters. He quickly shifted focus to Minnesota and the 10 other states that will pick between him and the former secretary of state on Super Tuesday. "Tuesday, over 800 delegates are at stake and we intend to win many, many of them," Sanders told the press gaggle on the tarmac.









Sanders previously defeated Clinton by 22 percentage points in New Hampshire. He came from behind to virtually tie her in Iowa. She notched a narrow win one week ago in Nevada.
