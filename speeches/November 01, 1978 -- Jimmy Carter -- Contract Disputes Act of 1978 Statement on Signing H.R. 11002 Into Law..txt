    I am pleased today to sign H.R. 11002, the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. This is landmark legislation in at least two respects.
First, it provides for the first time a uniform statutory base for the resolution of claims and disputes arising in connection with Federal contracts. The previous process was a mass of confusing and sometimes conflicting agency regulations, judicial decisions, decisions of agency boards of contract appeals, and statutes. This act will provide a much more logical and flexible means of resolving contract disputes. It should lead to savings for Federal agencies and their contractors.
Second, apart from the creation of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in 1974, it represents the first enactment into law of major recommendations of the Commission on Government Procurement.
I particularly would like to recognize the hard and effective work of Senator Lawton Chiles and Congressman Herb Harris in getting this legislation enacted. Senator Chiles was also a member of the Commission on Government Procurement and was, therefore, instrumental in the creation of the system reflected in this act.
