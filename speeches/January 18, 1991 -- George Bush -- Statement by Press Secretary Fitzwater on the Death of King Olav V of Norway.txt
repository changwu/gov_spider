    The President today sent a letter to His Majesty King Harald V and Her Majesty Queen Sonja of Norway extending President and Mrs. Bush's condolences on the death of King Olav V. In the letter, the President said that King Olav V was a symbol of Norway's spirit and verve, and that his graciousness and energy would be missed.
King Olav V lived in the United States during the Second World War as a guest of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. During his long reign, Norway and the United States have enjoyed a very close and productive friendship. He was much admired by the American people.
