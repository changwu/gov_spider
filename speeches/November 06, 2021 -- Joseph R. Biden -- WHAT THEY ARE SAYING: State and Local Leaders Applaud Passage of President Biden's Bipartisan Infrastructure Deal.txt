    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal – a once-in-a-generation investment that will create millions of jobs, modernize our infrastructure, and position America to compete – passed the House and now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.
Governors, mayors, and other local leaders across the country have known firsthand the need to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure. State and local leaders know all too well that Washington policymakers for too long have celebrated "infrastructure week" without following through. Now, President Biden forged consensus and is delivering infrastructure so we can rebuild roads, bridges, and other transit, expand access to clean drinking water, make affordable high-speed internet available to every household, and more.
State and local leaders praised the President and lawmakers who worked across the aisle to pass the historic legislation, which will make a real impact in communities across the country.
See below for what they are saying:
Governors
Governor Asa Hutchinson (R-AR), Chairman, National Governors Association and Governor Phil Murphy (D-NJ), Vice Chairman, National Governors Association: "On behalf of the National Governors Association, we applaud House members of both parties as they voted to advance the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, which passed out of the Senate in August. This historic investment will help fund states and territories' core infrastructure priorities including:
• $300 billion in funding to state highway projects and programs,• $73 billion investment in clean energy transmission upgrades,• $40 billion in grants to states for broadband deployment and to make broadband more accessible for low-income families in rural and urban communities alike, and• $17 billion in port infrastructure and $25 billion for airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon technologies.
This vital legislation should be sent to the President's desk as soon as possible so that states and territories can deploy these crucial infrastructure funds." [Statement, 11/5/21]
Governor Asa Hutchinson (R-AR), Chairman, National Governors Association: "Governors commend Congress for setting aside partisan differences to pass a bill that works for the American people. States stand ready to immediately put these funds to good use to fix and improve our nation's infrastructure." [Statement, 11/5/21]
Governor Phil Murphy (D-NJ), Vice Chairman, National Governors Association: "Passage of this crucial legislation reminds us that nothing is more important than delivering on the priorities of the American people, and we look forward to continuing to work with Congress to find long-term solutions that meet the infrastructure needs of every state." [Statement, 11/5/21]
Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), Chair, Democratic Governors' Association: "The passing of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a universal win for our country. From investing in our transit systems and delivering high-speed internet access to every American to expanding clean water access and rebuilding our roadways and bridges, these historic investments will have life-changing impacts for families now, and for generations to come. This bill means more good-paying jobs and sustainable, long-term economic growth. It will make our economy more competitive abroad and more resilient to meet the needs of the future and help tackle the climate crisis. The Build Back Better Framework delivers progress and opportunity for working families across the country, which is why it is incredibly popular among Americans — regardless of race, class, or political affiliation. Additionally, the bipartisan vote this plan received in Congress is a testament to what government can accomplish when leaders work together across the aisle to find solutions to the common challenges we all face. Democratic governors played a pivotal role in calling for the passage of this bill and providing input to make sure it met the most important needs in our states. While our states face different challenges, the critical need for investments in infrastructure is ubiquitous. We commend the Biden administration for passing a historic bill that meets the moment, and we look forward to working with the administration and with Congress to distribute the elements in the plan. This is an enormous achievement we all can celebrate." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Governor Jared Polis (D-CO): "Let's fix the roads and reduce traffic! This is a win for our country and a win for Colorado! I'm thrilled that Congress has passed with bipartisan support this once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve our roads, create new jobs, improve our drinking water, and tackle climate change," said Governor Polis. "Paired with our state's historic bipartisan infrastructure plan that I signed this summer, Colorado will see a transformation across all four corners of our state to make our roads safer and better for all Coloradans. Thank you, President Biden and Congress for your bipartisan work to bring real change across our country's entire infrastructure system." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Governor Ned Lamont (D-CT): Passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is a BIG DEAL! Right here in CT, we'll see commuting times speed up, new good paying jobs, and economic growth.

Governor John Bel Edwards (D-LA): "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a big win for Louisiana as it will allow the state to both advance long overdue and much-needed major road and bridge projects as well as help expand high speed broadband access, affordability and literacy. These bipartisan investments will be nothing short of transformational. Over the next five years, this nearly $6 billion federal investment will have a significant impact on major projects such as highways, bridges, public transportation, electric vehicle infrastructure, ports, and airports, and it will create a more resilient transportation system that can better withstand disruptions from extreme weather. Louisiana's aging infrastructure will receive improvements that create a better overall quality of life for all users, expand the economy, and provide a more reliable transportation system for citizens and businesses in Louisiana. In addition, expanded broadband, especially in rural areas of our state, will greatly benefit small businesses, farmers, students, teachers, healthcare professionals and so many others. In short, the historic investment levels of the IIJA provide a unique opportunity to improve and transform our state now and for generations to come. I commend Congress and the Biden Administration for this historic achievement, and I look forward to working with the legislature to ensure that we take full and immediate advantage of this opportunity to advance our state."

As this bill becomes law we must all continue our efforts to make sure we don't simply go back to normal, but rather build back better than before." [Statement, 11/6/21]
Mayor David Holt (R), Oklahoma City, OK: "For a decade, across three presidents of both parties, our nation's mayors advocated for a historic investment in our nation's infrastructure.

This plan brings historic funding to core infrastructure needs, including roads and bridges, public transit, passenger rail, water infrastructure and broadband. It passed the Senate with 69 votes, including the vote of Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell. Tonight it passed the House as well, and now goes to the President's desk. Over the next few years, this legislation will finally provide cities the major national infrastructure investment we have needed for so long. Also, the bipartisan nature of this legislation's development and passage demonstrates that our nation can still work together to do important things.
