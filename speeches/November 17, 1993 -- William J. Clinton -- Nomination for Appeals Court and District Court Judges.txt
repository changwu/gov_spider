    The President today nominated Judith Rogers, currently chief judge of the DC Court of Appeals, to be U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the District of Columbia Circuit. He also nominated attorney Thomas Vanaskie to be a U.S. District Court judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
"I am particularly proud to be making these appointments today. Judith Rogers' career has been one of historic firsts, and she will be only the second African-American woman ever to serve on a U.S. Court of Appeals. I am confident that she will continue the outstanding work she has done on Washington's highest court," said the President. "Likewise, I firmly believe that Thomas Vanaskie will exhibit all the qualities of an outstanding jurist on the District Court."
