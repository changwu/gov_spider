    The service reductions announced by Amtrak are tough but necessary choices in the face of stark fiscal realities and, along with the adjustments Amtrak announced last December, represent an urgent attempt to move the passenger railroad toward a stable economic future.
This administration remains committed to the future of rail passenger service in this country and has included significant capital support for Amtrak in its 1996 budget.
To address the pressures Amtrak faces and to promote a more businesslike approach, the Department of Transportation today transmitted to Congress the "Amtrak Restructuring Act of 1995."
I encourage rail labor, Congress, Governors, mayors, and other constituents to continue to work closely with Amtrak as it works to develop rail passenger service for the 21st century. We look to our partners in Congress to support the "Amtrak Restructuring Act of 1995" and for continued financial support of rail passenger service.
