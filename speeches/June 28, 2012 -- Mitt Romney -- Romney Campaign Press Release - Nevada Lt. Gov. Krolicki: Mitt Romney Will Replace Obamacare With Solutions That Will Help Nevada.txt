    Nevada Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama's overbearing healthcare law means a future of higher costs and mediocre healthcare for the citizens of Nevada. It means a future where burdensome federal regulations hinder job growth and small businesses. And it means a future where struggling Nevada families will have to pay more in taxes to fund an inefficient system. As Governor Romney has said time and time again, no matter what happens in the Supreme Court, we must dedicate ourselves to repealing this law. He has promised to do just that, starting on day one of his administration. With Governor Romney's leadership, we can replace Obamacare with healthcare solutions that are specifically designed to improve and sustain Nevada's citizens as well as bolster our economy."
