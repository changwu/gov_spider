    I am very pleased to sign today this important document which highlights the close relations which the United States and Spain have had for over 20 years.
This declaration articulates the fundamental principles which govern the cooperation between our two countries in many fields and proclaims our intention to continue this cooperation in the future. It also recognizes that the other nations of the North Atlantic area have benefited from our cooperation, especially in the field of security where our mutual endeavors have strengthened the cause of peace.
This declaration not only outlines our successful efforts in the past to work together for the security of both countries, but it addresses also the challenges of the future. In this regard our two countries are determined to expand our cooperation across broad ranging areas of mutual interest-such as the fields of scientific, economic, technical, and cultural cooperation-as well as in the collective defense effort.
I feel that the signing of this declaration, which was initialed last week in Madrid by Foreign Minister Cortina and Secretary Kissinger, marks an important milestone in the cordial relations between the United States and Spain. As friendly partners, we believe that our close association will benefit the peoples of both our countries and that our common effort will be of benefit to all who desire peace and progress in the world.
