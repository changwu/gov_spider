    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit the Civil Service Commission's annual report for fiscal year 1972.
The past year was one of significant initiatives in the field of Federal personnel management. Persistent challenges such as simplifying the complexities of the appeals system and broadening the scope of labor-management bargaining were effectively addressed. The first full year of operations under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act showed impressive results, as State and local governments responded enthusiastically in working with Federal agencies to improve personnel resources. Substantial progress was also made in carrying out the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, strengthening our commitment to employment practices which are scrupulously fair to all our people.
We can be grateful for the cooperation from all sectors and levels of government which made this record possible. And we can be proud that Federal personnel management not only enables us to serve the public more effectively but also stands as a respected model for all employers.
