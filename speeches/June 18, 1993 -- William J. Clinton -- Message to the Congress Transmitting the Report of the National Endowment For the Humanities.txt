    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 959(d)), I transmit herewith the 27th Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) for fiscal year 1992. This report was prepared by, and covers activities occurring exclusively during, the previous Administration. It does not necessarily reflect the policies or priorities of my Administration. The Annual Report for 1993, which I will submit next April, will reflect the goals and vision of my Administration for the NEH.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
