The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!Retweets: 29521Favorites: 104277

Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked 'have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?' He said strongly 'never no.' He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.Retweets: 27440Favorites: 102211

Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?Retweets: 31695Favorites: 130172
