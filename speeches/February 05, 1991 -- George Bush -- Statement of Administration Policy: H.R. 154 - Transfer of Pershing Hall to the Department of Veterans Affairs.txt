    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Montgomery (D) MS and Stump (R) AZ)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 154, provided it is offset as required in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).
Scoring for the Purpose of Pay-As-You-Go and Caps
H.R. 154 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. No offsets to the direct spending increases are provided in the bill. Because this bill is not fully offset, its enactment would add to the end of year pay-as-you-go requirement, which must be met to avoid sequester.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate. If H.R. 154 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required under OBRA. The cumulative effect of all enacted legislation on the pay-as-you-go requirement will be issued in monthly reports, transmitted to Congress.

In addition, H.R. 154 would transfer funding from a discretionary account to a mandatory account, thereby decreasing the discretionary cap by up to $1 million in the year that the transfer is made, H.R. 154 also requires that the mandatory account reimburse the discretionary account for the transfer of funds. If this reimbursement occurs between FY 1991 and FT 1995, the discretionary cap for that year would have to be adjusted.
