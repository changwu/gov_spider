LAKE JACKSON, Texas — Today, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul sent an email message to hundreds of thousands of his supporters and grassroots activists around the country about Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's recently announced plan to deal with the debt ceiling. See an excerpt from the message below.
"President Obama must be grinning from ear to ear.
Not only has the news reported yesterday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is scheming to raise the debt ceiling with no real spending cuts, but if this plan goes through, Senator McConnell will have handed yet more power over to the Executive Branch — just because the Senate GOP Leadership doesn't want to have to "deal with it" again!
In addition to surrendering more of Congress' power to President Obama, there is no timetable for the cuts in the bill — so they're rendered effectively meaningless."
