    Today I have the pleasure of naming Avril Haines as my Deputy National Security Advisor. Avril has been a key member of my national security team since early in the administration, including in her previous role as the National Security Council's Legal Adviser and in her current capacity as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A model public servant, Avril is respected across the Government for her intelligence, work ethic, and humility, which she has displayed in positions spanning the three branches of Government. I have the utmost trust and confidence in Avril, and I know she will continue to play a critical role in my administration's efforts to keep our Nation secure and promote American interests and values around the world.
Just as we welcome Avril, I again wish to thank and commend Antony Blinken, whom the Senate confirmed on Tuesday as Deputy Secretary of State. I look forward to continuing to work with Tony in his new capacity, and I am confident that Avril will fill his shoes expertly.
