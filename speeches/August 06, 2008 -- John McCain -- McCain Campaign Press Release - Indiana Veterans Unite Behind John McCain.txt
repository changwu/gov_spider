    INDIANAPOLIS, IN -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Indiana Veterans for McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Indiana's veterans' community. With 150 members representing all service branches, the group's membership spans generations, including veterans from World War II to the combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"John McCain's distinguished service in the United States Navy is a matter of record and there is no doubting his sacrifice for America as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. His history of putting his country first, from Hanoi to Washington, stands in stark contrast to Barack Obama's record, which reflects a willingness to ignore the facts and say whatever it takes to further his political career," said Congressman Steve Buyer, Co-Chair of Indiana Veterans for McCain. "Veterans back John McCain because he always backs us. From working tirelessly to improve veterans' health care to streamlining VA services, Senator McCain clearly understands that our nation is forever indebted to those who served in our nation's armed forces."
David Mann, a U.S. Naval Reservist, added: "McCain's strong support of our country's military family extends to those who are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While his opponent has played politics with troop funding, John McCain continues to fight for our servicemen and women while also working to ease their transition back to civilian life. At a time when fewer and fewer Americans know what it is like to serve in our armed forces, Senator McCain's experience will be immeasurable when he is elected president."
McCain's campaign announced the leadership of Indiana Veterans for McCain on Wednesday at a press event in Indianapolis that featured Congressman Steve Buyer, Mayor Greg Ballard, Lt. Gen. Carol Mutter, USMC (Ret.) and Rex Early and David Mann. Lieutenant General Carol Mutter is the first woman in the United States Armed Forces promoted to a three-star rank.
