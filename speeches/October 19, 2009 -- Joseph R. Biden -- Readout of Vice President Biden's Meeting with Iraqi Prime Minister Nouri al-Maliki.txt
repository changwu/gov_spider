    In his meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki earlier today, Vice President Biden noted that the October 20-21 U.S.-Iraq Business and Investment Conference is an important part of our efforts to promote cooperation under the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. The Vice President also encouraged the Iraqi Council of Representatives to act expeditiously on an election law that will set the terms for transparent political participation in the upcoming Iraqi national elections.
