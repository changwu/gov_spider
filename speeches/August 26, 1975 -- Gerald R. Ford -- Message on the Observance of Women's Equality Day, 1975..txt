    THE CELEBRATION of Women's Equality Day reminds us of how much more needs to be done to make equal opportunity a reality in our national life. Last year the United States joined with nations around the world in proclaiming 1975 as International Women's Year. This should add even greater encouragement to our national goals in this vitally important area.
Women's Equality Day gives me another welcome chance to assure all Americans that their Government is firmly committed to achieving a record during this important year which will be a source of national pride to us and inspiration to others. We are determined to make our Government a showcase of equal opportunity. Guided by the firm belief that our Nation derives its vitality from this basic concept, we shall not waiver in our task to make it the cornerstone of daily life throughout our country.
