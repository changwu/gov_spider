    The budget that congressional Republicans passed today is a series of missed opportunities. It fails to lock in debt reduction, fails to extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and fails to protect key investments for the American peopleâ€”from Head Start to clean water and law enforcement. While this budget marks a reversal from last year's failed effort by Republicans to drain the entire surplus for a tax cut, it still does not do enough to pay down the debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.
This year we have a unique opportunity to build on our success by passing a fiscally disciplined budget that pays down the debt, strengthens Social Security, shores up Medicare, and protects key investments in our children, the environment, and law enforcement. I am committed to accomplishing these goals to give the American people a budget that prepares for the future.
