When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone 'nuts' and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020 or little will get done!Retweets: 18112Favorites: 69413

The 'Constitutional Crisis' is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.Retweets: 17525Favorites: 63777

Their is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S. 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also the Tariffs can be.....Retweets: 11309Favorites: 49347

....completely avoided if you by from a non-Tariffed Country or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That's Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!...Retweets: 10000Favorites: 45376

..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China very good for USA!

I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don't make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal almost completed & you backed out!Retweets: 20544Favorites: 87353
