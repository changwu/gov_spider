    Governor Burns, Admiral Sharp, Senator Inouye, Senator Fong, Mrs. Mink, ladies, and gentlemen:
I am very grateful for your coming out to welcome us to this wonderful State. During the past few weeks I have been meeting with our senior military and diplomatic officers from Vietnam--Ambassador Bunker, General Westmoreland, and his successor, General Abrams.
I have come to Hawaii this time principally to meet with President Park, the leader of our brave ally, South Korea. I came a few days early so that I might review the situation in Vietnam with Admiral Sharp and his advisers and with his successor as Commander in Chief of the Pacific, Admiral McCain.
I hope that the next President of our country will be able to come to Hawaii during his term of office solely in order to discuss the peaceful development of Asia and the Pacific.
In the coming months, I am going to do everything within my power to try to bring that about and to make that possible. Today part of our search for peace lies through the processes of diplomacy. Another lies in the ability of our allied forces to meet every challenge that may confront them on the battlefield.
Here in Honolulu we shall be discussing both aspects of this search for peace during the next several days when we are here among you.
My friends, I thank you very much for offering us once again the hospitality that is so much a part of the Hawaiian tradition. I always enjoy coming here.
Thank you very much.
