    Rosalynn and I send warmest New Year greetings to Americans of Chinese ancestry who celebrate the coming of lunar year 4678.
Tradition has it, I am told, that the Year of the Monkey is often associated with financial adroitness and skill. At a time when we are facing some of our most challenging problems in this area, I hope this bodes well for our efforts to control inflation and achieve economic stability and growth. I hope it also portends prosperity and success for each of you who, individually and as an important ethnic group, contribute so much to our Nation's vitality and strength.
We wish you and your families good health, happiness, and full enjoyment of the fruits of your hard work.
