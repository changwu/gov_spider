Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me. It's a total new love letter to 'Trump' and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction!Retweets: 21272Favorites: 101436

...said was a total lie but Fake Media won't show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this great success!Retweets: 26410Favorites: 123059

After more than two years of Presidential Harassment the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.....Retweets: 20681Favorites: 87972

'Look how they're acting now and how we act when we're in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldn't find anything...they took a Fake Dossier & couldn't find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.' Congressman Mark Green (R-TN).Retweets: 21374Favorites: 88338

My wonderful daughter Ivanka will be interviewed tonight by Steve Hilton on 'The Next Revolution.' @FoxNews 9:00 P.M. She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!). Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M. a great show!Retweets: 17380Favorites: 89066

The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!Retweets: 24017Favorites: 118394
