    We have had an opportunity to discuss in the most friendly and cordial manner the different problems arising in the relations between the Governments of the United States and of Haiti.
In connection with the departure of the United States Marines from Haiti during the month of October, next, as already provided in the Agreement of August 7, 1933, President Roosevelt intends to request authority from the Congress of the United States to make a gift to Haiti of a portion of the Marine Corps material which the Haitian Government feels would be useful to it.
We have exchanged views regarding the possibility of a commercial agreement which would increase the flow of goods between the two countries; and finally we have discussed a new form of financial administration which is satisfactory to our two Governments and which should be equally satisfactory to the holders of the bonds of the 1922 loan.
We are both inclined to the belief that the policy of the good neighbor which the Government of the United States is endeavoring to apply in its relations with the other American Republics will be signally manifested in the results which will be obtained from this exchange of views and from negotiations which are now taking place with a view to the practical application of the decisions reached in principle during our present conversations.
Certainly Haiti will now be in a position to look forward to her future with the greatest confidence.
