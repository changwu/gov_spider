Kimberly Klacik is really working hard to help the people of Baltimore. She is running for Congress as a Republican, & if she wins she will be an inspiration to all.

People are tired of watching the highly political @NBA. Basketball ratings are WAY down, and they won't be coming back.

It never ends! Now they are trying to say that your favorite President, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes. Never happened to THIS candidate - FAKE NEWS.

Drudge didn't support me in 2016, and I hear he doesn't support me now. Maybe that's why he is doing poorly. His Fake News report on Mini-Strokes is incorrect. Possibly thinking about himself, or the other party's "candidate". https://t.co/9FraoFqOKqRetweets: 12874Favorites: 45339
