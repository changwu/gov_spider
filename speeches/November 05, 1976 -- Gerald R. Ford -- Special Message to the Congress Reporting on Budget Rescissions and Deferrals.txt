    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I am withdrawing one previously proposed rescission and reporting three new deferrals. In addition, I am reporting revisions to two deferrals previously transmitted.
The withdrawal is for the highway crossing federal projects program of the Federal Highway Administration. The three new deferrals, totaling $980.8 million affect programs of the Departments of Defense, Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Treasury. The revised deferrals are for programs in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and reflect routine increases in the amounts previously deferred.
The details of the rescission withdrawal and each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
