    (Washington, DC) â€“ The CEO of the National Diversity Coalition is endorsing Steven Mnuchin to be the next Treasury Secretary today. Faith Bautista, who also heads the National Asian American Coalition, worked with Steven Mnuchin to help homeowners who had received mortgages from IndyMac Bank receive loan modifications under Steven's leadership at OneWest Bank.
"Members of the National Diversity Coalition worked with Steven Mnuchin and OneWest bank and know first hand his commitment to homeownership, economic development, and a strong economy. In 2004, the National Asian American Coalition was approved by HUD to counsel homeowners dealing with foreclosure and during the housing crisis we personally saw Steven Mnuchin and OneWest help distressed homeowners receive loan modifications and save thousands of jobs. I know that as our next Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will help implement an economic agenda that will lead to more jobs and more hope for all Americans." - Faith Bautista, CEO, National Diversity Coalition.
