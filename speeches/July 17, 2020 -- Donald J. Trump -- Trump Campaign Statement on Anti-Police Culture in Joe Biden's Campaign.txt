    President Donald J. Trump's re-election campaign today issued the following statement in response to a report that a Joe Biden campaign staffer "mocked cops as worse than 'pigs,' called for defunding police":
"Joe Biden can't hide from the fact the radical left-wing party he leads has such visceral hatred of the police, the men and women who bravely put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities. At a time when police officers are under increasingly violent attack, Joe Biden has allowed a sickening anti-police culture to pervade his campaign. He sits silently and says nothing as police are viciously assaulted by left-wing mobs. His staff proudly posts bail for rioters arrested for destroying property and hurting innocents in Minneapolis. He defames police as 'the enemy' and calls for cutting their funding. And now Biden employs a staffer who uses the most vile, inflammatory, and incendiary language to target the brave men and women who risk their own lives to keep us safe. How can Joe Biden look in the faces of grieving law enforcement families whose loved ones died in the line of duty? Never in history has a major party campaign so angrily fanned the flames of hatred against our nation's heroes."
