    The United States is encouraged by President Yanukovych's decision to pardon former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko and former Environment Minister Heorhiy Filipchuk. This is an important step toward addressing concerns about democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine, however much more remains to be done. We urge Ukrainian authorities to end all politically motivated prosecutions, undertake comprehensive judicial reform to ensure such selective justice does not recur, and fully implement the OSCE recommendations made after the 2012 parliamentary elections. The United States strongly supports the aspirations of the Ukrainian people for a democratic, prosperous, and European future, which can only be realized through continued democratic reform and adherence to the rule of law. We remain dedicated to strengthening our bilateral relationship on the basis of our shared transatlantic values.
