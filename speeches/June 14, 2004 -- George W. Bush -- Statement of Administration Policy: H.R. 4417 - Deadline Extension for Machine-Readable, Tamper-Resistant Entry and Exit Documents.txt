    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Sensenbrenner (R) Wisconsin and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 4417, which would extend the deadlines for requiring that foreign countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) issue machine-readable, tamper-resistant entry and exit documents. The Administration agrees that additional time beyond the initial October 26, 2004 deadline is needed for our global VWP partners to fully address the complex technological and privacy issues that must be resolved and ensure that the standardized biometric solutions will be effective once deployed worldwide for international travel documents. Absent an extension of these deadlines, the United States would face serious disruptions to travel and tourism, possibly resulting in multi-billion dollar losses to the Nation's economy.
The Administration remains concerned that the bill provides only a one-year extension to October 2005, rather than the two-year extension through November 30, 2006, requested by the Administration. The Administration continues to believe that an extension of two years is needed to effectively address these complex issues. The Administration will continue to work with the international community to ensure effective implementation of technologies that meet international standards and the Congress to ensure there are effective deadlines.
