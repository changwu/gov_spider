    A group of our fellow citizens from around the country, different backgrounds, have given me a report called "Recommendations to the Nation on Reducing U.S. Oil Dependence." These citizens have spent time thinking about the national security implications for a country which is dependent on oil from hostile regimes or sources of oil that could be affected by terrorist attack. And I really want to thank you for this comprehensive approach to reducing our dependency on oil. Some really smart ideas in here.
The reason I have asked to come and talk to them is, I wanted to assure them that this administration is committed, as well, to diversifying away from our reliance upon oil. And I believe, like they believe, that we've got fantastic opportunities to use new technologies to secure the American people and, at the same time, be better stewards of the environment.
Their plan and my plan are very—have got commonalities, and we're going to work together to get Congress to enact a comprehensive plan. I believe there's an appetite in the Halls of Congress to become less dependent on oil. I believe there's a knowledge in Congress that when we spend money on cellulosic ethanol that will make us less dependent on oil.
And I'm going to continue to call upon citizens' groups and concerned citizens to work with Members of Congress so we can—I can sign a comprehensive plan that will assure the American people that as we look forward into the 21st century that we'll be more energy dependent and good stewards of the environment.
So thank you for your efforts. I appreciate your work. I'm honored to be at the table with citizens who care enough about their country that they would take time out of their private lives and present me with this comprehensive view.
Thank you very much.
