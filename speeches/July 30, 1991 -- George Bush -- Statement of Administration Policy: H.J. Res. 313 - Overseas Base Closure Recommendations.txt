    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Aspin (D) Wisconsin and 24 others)
The Administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 313, which would include overseas bases in the domestic base closure process established by P.L. 101-510. The Secretary of Defense already has the authority to end or reduce operations overseas and return overseas bases to the host nation. The Secretary has announced reductions at 14 percent of the Department of Defense's (DOD) overseas base structure to date. More announcements will be made over the coming months and years as DOD continues to drawdown its forces overseas. H.J. Res. 313 could delay overseas base reductions and slow the return of U.S. military forces to the United States. The joint resolution could also interfere with the President's conduct of foreign affairs. As the Commission meets only once every two years, heavy: reliance on the Commission process for overseas closures could keep DOD from bringing overseas-based forces home in a timely fashion.
