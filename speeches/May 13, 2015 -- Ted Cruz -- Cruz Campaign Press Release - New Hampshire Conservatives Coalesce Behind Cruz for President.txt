HOUSTON, Texas â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today announced more than 40 New Hampshire conservatives to his state leadership team, to be led by former U.S. Senator Bob Smith, New Hampshire Representative and former Speaker William O'Brien, and Executive Councilor David K. Wheeler.
"I am thrilled to have all of these courageous conservatives join our campaign in New Hampshire and honored to have Bob Smith, Bill O'Brien and David Wheeler leading this team," said Sen. Cruz. "I couldn't ask for a stronger, more equipped group of patriots at the helm of our ground game in New Hampshire."
Sen. Smith, Speaker O'Brien and Councilor Wheeler today held a press conference with other members of the leadership team to voice their support for Sen. Cruz's leadership and endorsement of his candidacy, noting that he is the only candidate positioned to being real change to the status quo in Washington.
"As a former United States Senator I have seen firsthand the difficulty in challenging the status quo in the halls of power. Changing Washington will require exceptional leadership. Ted Cruz is that exceptional leader," said former US Senator Bob Smith. "I knew Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was a friend of mine. And let me tell you, as one conservative to another, Senator Ted Cruz is a lot like Ronald Reagan."
"In my experience as a legislative leader, there is a tremendous resistance to change how government operates. Too many politicians claim to be the change we need, but once elected simply fail to deliver," said Representative Bill O'Brien. "Ted Cruz has a proven record of standing for principle and doing what he says he will do."
"If you like what you got, you will have plenty of good candidates to choose from. But real change requires real leadership." said Executive Council Member David Wheeler. "I believe Ted Cruz is the only candidate who is serious about fixing Washington."
