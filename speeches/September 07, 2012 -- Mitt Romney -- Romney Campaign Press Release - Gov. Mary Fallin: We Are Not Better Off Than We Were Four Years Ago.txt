    Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today made the following statement on the August unemployment report:
"President Obama came into office promising to create jobs and restore hope to America â€“ promises he repeated last night. Yet today we got yet another disappointing jobs report showing anemic growth, with the unemployment rate stuck above 8 percent for the longest spell since the Great Depression. With more than 10 million homeowners underwater on their mortgages, 47 million people on food stamps, and countless more Americans struggling to make ends meet, we know that things are not better today than they were four years ago. It's time to change course and implement policies that help the middle class thrive and grow. We must have a renewed focus on putting people back to work. That's what the American people expect and deserve, and that's what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will deliver."
