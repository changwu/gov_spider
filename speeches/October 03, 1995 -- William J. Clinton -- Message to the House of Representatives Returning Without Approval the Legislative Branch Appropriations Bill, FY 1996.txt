    To the House of Representatives:
I am returning today without my approval H.R. 1854, the "Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill, FY 1996."
H.R. 1854 is, in fact, a disciplined bill, one that I would sign under different circumstances. But, at this point, Congress has completed action on only two of the 13 FY 1996 appropriations bills: this one and H.R. 1817, the Military Construction appropriations bill. Thus, the vast majority of Federal activities lack final FY 1996 funding and are operating under a short-term continuing resolution.
I appreciate the willingness of Congress to work with my Administration to produce an acceptable short-term continuing resolution before completing action on the regular, full-year appropriations bills for FY 1996. I believe, however, that it would be inappropriate to provide full-year regular funding for Congress and its offices while funding for most other activities of Government remains incomplete, unresolved, and uncertain.
As I said two months ago, I don't think Congress should take care of its own business before it takes care of the people's business. I stated that if the congressional leadership were to follow through on its plan to send me its own funding bill before finishing work on the rest of the budget, I would veto it. I am now following through on that commitment.
I urge the Congress to move forward promptly on completing the FY 1996 appropriations bills in a form that I can accept.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
