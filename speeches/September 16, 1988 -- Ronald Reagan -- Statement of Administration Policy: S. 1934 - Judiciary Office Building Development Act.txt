    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Moynihan (D) New York and 2 others)
The Administration opposes S. 1934 unless it is amended to:

—    remedy provisions violating the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. In particular, section (7) must be revised to provide that the President appoint the members of the Commission for the Judiciary Office Building, and section (3)(a)(6) should indicate that all final decisions regarding the architectural design of the building be made "in consultation with" (as opposed to "subject to the approval of") the Chief Justice; and
—    delete provisions in sections (3) and (4) requiring the use of a "lease/purchase" arrangement to finance the building's construction. "Lease/purchase" financing may violate the Anti-Deficiency Act and is likely to be more expensive than the outright purchase of the building. 
Consequently, the Administration urges that S. 1934 not be considered under suspension of the rules, and that the bill be amended as indicated above.
