    As the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah begins this evening, Michael Glassner, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor, issued the following statement:
"To mark this sacred day, Team Trump sends our warmest wishes to our Jewish friends all over the world as we celebrate the start of the Jewish New Year. We join you in reflecting on this past year while celebrating all we have accomplished, and look toward the future with boundless optimism. Throughout his first term, President Trump has been the fiercest ally of the Jewish community â€“ safeguarding our religious liberties, relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, actively combating anti-Semitism, and establishing peace between Israel and Arab countries through the historic Abraham Accords. May you and your family enjoy God's blessings as we pray for peace and prosperity for all the days to come. L'shanah tovah."
