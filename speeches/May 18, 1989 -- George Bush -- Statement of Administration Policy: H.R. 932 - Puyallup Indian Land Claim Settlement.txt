    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dicks (D) Washington)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 932, which would require an unwarranted Federal cash payment of $77 million to implement one of the iargest Indian land claim settlements in this century. This bill, which would largely benefit the Tacoma, Washington area, is objectionable because:

there is little risk of Federal liability with regard to any claims related to the settlement; and
the final settlement was negotiated without Executive Branch participation.

H.R. 932 would establish a seriously adverse and costly precedent for Indian land and water claim settlements in the future.
