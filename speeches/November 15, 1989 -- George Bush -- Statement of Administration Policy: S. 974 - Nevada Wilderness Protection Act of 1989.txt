    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reid (D) Nevada and Bryan (D) Nevada)
The Administration opposes S. 974, unless it is amended to delete four new wilderness areas, and modify the boundaries of others, to conform the wilderness designations with those recommended in National Forest Land and Resource Management Plans. If S. 974 were amended to reduce the wilderness designations from 733,400 to 412,400 acres, as proposed by Representative Vucanovich, the Administration would support the enactment of S. 974.
