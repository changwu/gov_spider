    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Additional Protocol that Modifies the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on September 18, 1992. The Additional Protocol was signed at Mexico City on September 8, 1994. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Additional Protocol.
The Additional Protocol will amend the tax treaty provisions to broaden the scope of tax information exchange with Mexico. The Protocol will authorize the exchange of tax information under any tax information exchange agreement between the two countries and will provide for information exchange under the treaty for taxes at all levels of government.
The current Agreement Between the United States of America and the United Mexican States for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes, which now applies only to Federal taxes, is also being amended by a protocol to provide for the exchange of information to administer and enforce tax laws at all levels of government. This protocol, which was also signed at Mexico City on September 8, 1994, will enter into force only after the Protocol to the Convention has been ratified.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Additional Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 15, 1994.
