    Georgia families are suffering. They're suffering because of Donald Trump's complete and utter failure to lead this country and combat the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 Georgians and positive COVID-19 cases continue to climb. More than 2.7 million unemployment claims have been filed since mid-March. Unemployment is worse than it was during the Great Recession. This administration's mismanagement has left working families and small business owners out in the cold as they endure the worst economic losses the country has faced in modern memory. Americans need a concrete, effective reopening plan that's rooted in science and public health. They need a President who has a vision and can lead us out of this cataclysmic mess with an inclusive economy that will help create jobs and get our economy back on track.
