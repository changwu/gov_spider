    Jack Danforth has served with distinction as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. He represented our Nation ably and well during a time when we are waging a global war on terror. Because of his tireless efforts as Special Envoy to the Sudan, the world is closer than ever to seeing an end to the Sudanese North-South conflict. Throughout his life, including as a distinguished United States Senator and as Attorney General of Missouri, Jack Danforth has been a man of strong convictions and deep integrity who has made our country better and stronger. I understand his desire to return home to Missouri, and I thank Jack for his superb service and his friendship. I wish Sally and him all the best.
