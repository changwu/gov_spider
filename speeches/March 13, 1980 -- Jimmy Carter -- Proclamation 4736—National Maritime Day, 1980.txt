  A Proclamation

Throughout the history of the United States, trade and shipping have made a vital contribution to the Nation's growth and economic vitality. Today, the American Merchant Marine continues to aid the development of American enterprise and to foster the well-being of all American citizens by linking U.S. industries, farms and markets with our overseas trading partners.
In addition, our Merchant Marine has shown valor and dedication in providing logistic support to United States military forces in times of national emergency.
In recognition of the importance of the American Merchant Marine, and in commemoration of the departure from Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819, of the S.S. Savannah on the first transatlantic voyage by any steamship, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution of May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73, 36 U.S.C. 145), designated May 22 of each year as National Maritime Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for appropriate observances.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do urge the people of the United States to honor our American Merchant Marine on May 22, 1980, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and other suitable places, and I call upon all ships under the American flag to dress ship on that day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
