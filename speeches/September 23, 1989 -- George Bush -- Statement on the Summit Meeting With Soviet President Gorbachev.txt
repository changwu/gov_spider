    I look forward to meeting with President Gorbachev. The state of U.S.-Soviet relations is good, and I have enjoyed a positive working relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. Our meeting will afford an opportunity to reaffirm our mutual commitment to moving the U.S.-Soviet relationship forward, as underscored by the progress at the Wyoming ministerial. I commend the efforts of Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. I envision a broad discussion of the full agenda that the two sides have established: human rights, bilateral relations, arms control, regional issues, and transnational issues.
