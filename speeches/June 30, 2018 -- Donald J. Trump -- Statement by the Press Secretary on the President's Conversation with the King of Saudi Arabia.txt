    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. President Trump and King Salman reiterated their commitment to the strong United States-Saudi Arabia partnership across political, security, and economic fields. The two leaders reaffirmed their dedication to a healthy and stable global energy market for the benefit of all nations.
The two leaders agreed that balancing the global oil market is essential to ensure access to reliable and affordable energy to people everywhere.
In response to the President's assessment of a deficit in the oil market, King Salman affirmed that the Kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity, which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability, and in coordination with its producer partners, to respond to any eventuality.
