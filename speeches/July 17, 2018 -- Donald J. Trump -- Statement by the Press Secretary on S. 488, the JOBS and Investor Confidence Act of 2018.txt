    President Donald J. Trump commends the House of Representatives for passing S. 488, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018. This bill would enact commonsense regulatory reforms to help American entrepreneurs and small businesses raise the capital they need to innovate more and create more jobs. The President congratulates Chairman Hensarling and members of the Committee on this bipartisan legislation, which will further strengthen the United States economy. As the bill moves back to the Senate for consideration, the Administration will work with Congressional leaders to make several technical and substantive changes to the legislation with the goal of presenting final legislation to the President as soon as possible.
