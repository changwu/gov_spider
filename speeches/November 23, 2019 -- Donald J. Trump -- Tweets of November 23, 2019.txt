Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect) to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax. Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!Retweets: 25845Favorites: 109114

Joe Concha The Hill: 'In Emerson College Poll Impeachment among independents 49% Oppose 34% Support. You see why Pelosi is reluctant to go in with this. Dems have to go home and explain why they haven't done something on Opioid crisis drug prices USMCA the Border etc.Retweets: 20175Favorites: 75476

'The Democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing. The Whistleblower the guy who took his case to Schiff's staff first is what really blows the lid off this entire saga. He worked for Biden on Ukraine policy when Biden was VP. He worked for deep state henchman JohnRetweets: 20235Favorites: 70334

NEW YORK POST EDITORIAL. 'Worse Than Pointless. All those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal: to change American's minds. Part of the problem is that Democrats already leaked the best evidence they had. More important NOT ONE WITNESS OFFERED.....Retweets: 18036Favorites: 69939

....Sondland said Trump told him. None of this will move the needle for anyone. And now Dems in Swing Districts head home for Thanksgiving to hear from voters. Pelosi & Co. are putting on a show to appease the Democratic base instead if doing the work ALL Americans need done.'Retweets: 1963Favorites: 6559

....ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID ANYTHING IMPEACHABLE. No one heard him order a quid pro quo. No one offered a convincing reason why Trump's interest in having Ukraine probe potential cortuption warrants Impeachment. 'I want no Quid Pro Quo' Ambassador....Retweets: 11962Favorites: 47512
