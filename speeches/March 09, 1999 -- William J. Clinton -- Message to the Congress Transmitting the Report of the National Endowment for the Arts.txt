    To the Congress of the United States:
It is my pleasure to transmit herewith the Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Arts for Fiscal Year 1997.
The Arts Endowment awards more than one thousand grants each year to nonprofit arts organizations for projects that bring the arts to millions of Americans. Once again, this year's grants reflect the diversity of our Nation's culture and the creativity of our artists. Whether seeing a classic theatrical production in Connecticut or an art exhibition in Arizona, whether listening to a symphony in Iowa or participating in a fine arts training program for inner-city students in Louisiana, Americans who benefit from Arts Endowment grants have experienced the power and joy of the arts in their lives.
Arts Endowment grants in 1997 supported:
• projects in theater, dance, music, visual arts, and the other artistic disciplines, demonstrating that our diversity is an asset—and helping us to interpret the past, understand each other in the present, and envision the future;
• folk and traditional arts programs, which strengthen and showcase our rich cultural heritage; and
• arts education, which helps improve our children's skills and enhances their lives with the richness of the arts.
The arts challenge our imaginations, nourish our spirits, and help to sustain our democracy.
We are a Nation of creators and innovators. As this report illustrates, the NEA continues to celebrate America's artistic achievements and makes the arts more accessible to the American people.
