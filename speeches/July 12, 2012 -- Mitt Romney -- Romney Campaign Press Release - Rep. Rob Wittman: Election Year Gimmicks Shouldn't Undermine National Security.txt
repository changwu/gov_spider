    Congressman Rob Wittman today made the following statement on President Obama's devastating cuts to defense spending:
"Our men and women in uniform are the best in the world. We owe it to them to provide the resources and tools they need to do their job in defending this great nation. We must do all we can to avoid the looming massive defense cuts, and I am disappointed that President Obama has been silent on this critical issue. When it comes to national security, our strategy should determine our military needs, not political expediency and not election-year gimmicks."
