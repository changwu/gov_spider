    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/8/91)(House)(Markey (D) Massachusetts and 34 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2109 because the proposed site does not meet National Park Service criteria for study as a potential addition to the National Park System. It would be more appropriate for State and regional agencies to study and preserve the site.
