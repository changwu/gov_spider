    Dr. J.D. Crouch II came to the White House in January 2005 to serve as my Deputy National Security Adviser. J.D. has served our country with great distinction during a critical period in our history, as we confront new challenges and pursue a global war on terror. In the past 21‚ÅÑ2 years, his accomplishments have been many. He was at the forefront in devising and implementing the new strategy to help build a peaceful, stable, and secure Iraq. He was instrumental in developing the new national security strategy that charts a course for advancing our interests abroad, enhancing global security and liberty, and protecting the American people. J.D. is leaving the White House, but Steve Hadley, all his colleagues, and I have benefited greatly from his wise counsel and tireless commitment to public service.
