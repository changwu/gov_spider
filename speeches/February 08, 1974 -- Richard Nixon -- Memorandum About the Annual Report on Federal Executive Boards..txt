    Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies:
Over the past 12 years Federal Executive Boards have more than proven their worth as locally-based coordinating mechanisms.
The results reported in the attached annual report give further evidence of the boards' usefulness to Federal agencies and to the citizens of major cities in which they are located.
I am particularly pleased to note the increased involvement of representatives of other levels of government and private groups in the work of the boards. Working together they can generate ideas and resources to help solve our most vexing problems. I am today asking the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish energy conservation as a major theme of FEBs for fiscal year 1974.
Please inform your senior officials in the field of my strong personal interest in their work as Federal Executive Board members, and urge their continued involvement and support.
RICHARD NIXON
