    The Hillary Clinton for President campaign announced today the Virginia Women's Steering Committee, comprised of over 400 of the state's prominent leaders in government, business, education and politics, who will provide outreach for the campaign leading up to the Virginia primary on February 12.
The committee includes Founder of Virginia NOW, Mollie Abraham; State Senator Mary Margaret Whipple; and Arlington County Sheriff, Beth Arthur.
"Hillary Clinton has the hopeful vision, tested experience, and proven intelligence to take on today's toughest economic and social issues. She's a veteran fighter for children's issues, health care reform, and women and family rights concerns," said Mary Sue Terry, former Virginia Attorney General. "She is the best choice for Virginia families."
The Virginia Women's Steering Committee is helping to spearhead the Clinton campaign's outreach efforts throughout the state.
