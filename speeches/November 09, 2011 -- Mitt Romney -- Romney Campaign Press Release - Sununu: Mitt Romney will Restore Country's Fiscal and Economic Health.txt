    Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu made the following statement on tonight's economic debate in Rochester, Michigan:
"Mitt Romney was the winner of tonight's debate because it was again clear that he is the only candidate who has the capability to turn around our economy. On both economic and fiscal policy, Mitt Romney is the only candidate with the conservative record and plan to go toe-to-toe with President Obama next year and win in November. Unlike our current president, Mitt Romney actually knows how the economy works and how businesses grow and hire. This understanding of the economy will be key to reversing three years of failures and rebuilding our economy."
