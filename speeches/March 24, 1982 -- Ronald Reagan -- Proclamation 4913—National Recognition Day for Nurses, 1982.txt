  A Proclamation

Scientific advancements in recent years have dramatically expanded the role of nurses in our health care system, and their knowledge and skills have increased to keep pace with new technologies and methods of treatments.
Yet, the very core of nursing—caring for patients at the bedside—remains unchanged. Nurses bring a special compassion and concern for the patient and for the patient's family.
Nurses play a vital role in educating people in how to avoid illness and promote good health.
Nurses are essential to every health care setting—in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory care centers, and patients' homes.
Cardiac, post-surgical, trauma, and burn units require intensive nursing care around the clock. Community health nurses enable the elderly to receive needed care in their own homes. Nurses trained in maternal and child health provide much of the care in urban and rural clinics.
Nurses with specialized training treat cancer patients, stroke victims, and psychiatric patients. Nurse researchers are developing new and better ways to improve nursing practice, reduce patient stress, and help patients and their families cope with illness.
The nurses of this country deserve our gratitude for their personal and professional contributions to the improved health of American citizens.
The Congress has, by House Joint Resolution 263, Public Law 97-57, demonstrated its commitment by requesting me to designate May 6, 1982, as National Recognition Day for Nurses.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 6, 1982, as National Recognition Day for Nurses.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 24th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
