    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to President Obama's press briefing this morning focused on the ongoing debt limit negotiations.
"I continue to be deeply concerned about the direction President Obama is taking the negotiations to raise our nation's debt limit," said Senator Santorum. "The president's focus on picking winners and losers through targeted job growth and raising taxes as our economy teeters on the brink is irresponsible. The president and congressional leaders need to make the difficult decisions about spending cuts now, and prioritize passing a Balanced Budget Amendment so that we end the market's concern about our nation's escalating debt problems."
