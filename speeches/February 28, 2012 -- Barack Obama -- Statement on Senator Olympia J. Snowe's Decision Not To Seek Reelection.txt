    For nearly four decades, Olympia Snowe has served the people of the great State of Maine. Elected to the statehouse in 1973, Olympia went on to be the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of a State legislature and both Houses of Congress. From her unwavering support for our troops, to her efforts to reform Wall Street, to fighting for Maine's small businesses, Senator Snowe's career demonstrates how much can be accomplished when leaders from both parties come together to do the right thing for the American people. Michelle and I join Mainers in thanking Senator Snowe for her service, and we wish her and her family all the best in the future.
