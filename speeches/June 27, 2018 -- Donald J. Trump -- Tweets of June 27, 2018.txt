Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place just LOST his primary election. In other words he's out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer and more respectful to his President!Retweets: 23672Favorites: 119570

Congratulations to Maxine Waters whose crazy rants have made her together with Nancy Pelosi the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear America is now stronger than ever before and I'm not going anywhere!Retweets: 36724Favorites: 156734

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON'T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS & SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME. WIN!Retweets: 21991Favorites: 98022

Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now as an example able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!Retweets: 23027Favorites: 102751

Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America with the people that got you your success. I've done so much for you and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won't forget and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!Retweets: 17963Favorites: 83318
