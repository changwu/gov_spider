.@SecAzar and I will soon release a plan to let Florida and other States import prescription drugs that are MUCH CHEAPER than what we have now! Hard-working Americans don't deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need. We are fighting DAILY to make sure this HAPPENS...Retweets: 20466Favorites: 78098

...While we had the first prescription drug price decrease in 50 years Americans still pay far too much for drugs ' other countries pay far less ' that is WRONG! We will soon be putting more options on the table...Retweets: 6433Favorites: 21659

...Pelosi and her Do Nothing Democrats drug pricing bill doesn't do the trick. FEWER cures! FEWER treatments! Time for the Democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families...Retweets: 11840Favorites: 46494

...House Republicans are showing real LEADERSHIP and prepared to enact bipartisan solutions for drug prices. Do Nothing Democrats are playing partisan politics with YOUR drug prices! We are READY to work together if they actually want to get something done!Retweets: 12674Favorites: 47487
