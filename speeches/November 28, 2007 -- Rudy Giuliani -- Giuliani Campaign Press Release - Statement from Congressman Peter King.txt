    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement from Congressman Peter King on tonight's debate:
"Tonight's debate showed once again that Rudy is the real deal. You know where you stand with Mayor Giuliani and you can believe him when he says he'll cut taxes, restrain runaway spending and end illegal immigration because he's tackled the tough issues before and gotten results. Rudy's authenticity, experience and frankness on the issues stand out in a field of candidates relying on tired rhetoric and political one-liners."
