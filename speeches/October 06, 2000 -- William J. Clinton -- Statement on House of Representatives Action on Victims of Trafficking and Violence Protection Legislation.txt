    I applaud the House of Representatives for passing vital legislation today to combat trafficking in humans and strengthen and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The "Trafficking Victims Protection Act" will provide important new tools in the campaign to combat trafficking, a modern form of slavery and an insidious human rights abuse. VAWA, which expired on September 30, has significantly improved the lives of thousands of women who are victims of domestic violence and has assisted State, local, and tribal law enforcement to combat domestic violence and sexual assault. It is imperative that this law be reauthorized this year, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation without delay.
