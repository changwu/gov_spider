    I speak for all Americans in expressing our heartfelt sadness at the death of Romulo Betaneourt. While he was first and foremost a Venezuelan patriot, Romulo Betancourt was an especially close friend of the United States. During the 1950's he considered the United States a refuge while he was in exile, and we were proud to receive him. We are honored that this courageous man whose life was dedicated to the principles of liberty and justice—a man who fought dictatorships of the right and the left—spent his final days on our shores. We join the Venezuelan people and those who love freedom around the world in mourning his death.
