At A July 2007 Debate, Barack Obama Announced He Would Personally Meet With Rogue Leaders, Including Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, "Without Precondition." QUESTION: "[W]ould you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?"... OBAMA: "I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration - is ridiculous. And I think that it is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them." (CNN/YouTube Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Charleston, SC, 7/23/07)
