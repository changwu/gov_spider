    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons drawn up within the Council of Europe by a committee of experts from member States and observers from the United States and Canada, as adopted by the Council of Ministers, and signed on behalf of the United States at Strasbourg on March 21, 1983.
The provisions of the Convention are explained in a report of the Acting Secretary of State which accompanies this letter. The major advantages of a multilateral treaty on this subject are that it provides uniform procedures for transfer of sentenced persons and saves the resources that would be required to negotiate and bring into force bilateral treaties with a substantial number of member States of the Council of Europe in whose jails approximately one fourth of our citizens imprisoned abroad are serving sentences.
I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this treaty at an early date.
