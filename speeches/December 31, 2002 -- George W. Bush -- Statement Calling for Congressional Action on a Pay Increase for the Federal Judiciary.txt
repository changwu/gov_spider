    Today I have issued an Executive order entitled "Adjustments of Certain Rates of Pay." This order implements the January 2003 pay raise for members of the uniformed services and for Federal civilian employees under the General Schedule and certain related pay systems.
This Executive order sets forth the unadjusted pay schedule for members of the Federal judiciary. Due to section 140 of Public Law 97-92, I do not have the authority to order a pay increase for Federal judges. I hereby urge the Congress to specifically authorize a pay increase for Federal judges.
