    As modern American society becomes more and more hectic and complex, there is a desire in all of us to return to the simple things in life.
This perhaps in part explains the growing popularity—even in our busiest metropolitan areas—of country music. And designated as "Country Music Month," October invites us all to return, at least vicariously, to the hills and the farms of America and to retrace the everyday emotions and experiences of country life.
Country music is part of the soul and conscience of our democracy. It unfolds the inherent goodness of our people and of our way of life. It captures our indomitable spirit and pulsates with the sorrows, joys and unfailing perseverance of ordinary men and women who sustain our national vitality and strength.
I welcome the opportunity to applaud the Country Music Association on its sponsorship of this annual observance, and I encourage more Americans to share in the enjoyment and cultural enrichment that country music can bring.
