    To the Congress of the United States:
As required by section 19(3) of the Public Telecommunications Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-356), I transmit herewith a report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This report outlines, first, the Corporation's efforts to facilitate the continued development of superior, diverse, and innovative programming and, second, the Corporation's efforts to solicit the views of the public on current programming initiatives.
This report summarizes 1997 programming decisions and outlines how Corporation funds were distributedâ€”$47.9 million for television program development, $18.8 million for radio programming development, and $15.6 million for general system support. The report also reviews the Corporation's Open to the Public campaign which allows the public to submit comments via mail, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, or the Corporation's Internet website.
I am confident this year's report will meet with your approval and commend, as always, the Corporation's efforts to deliver consistently high quality programming that brings together American families and enriches all our lives.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, March 18, 1999.
