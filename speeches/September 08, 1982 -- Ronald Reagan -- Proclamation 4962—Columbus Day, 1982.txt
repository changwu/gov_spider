  A Proclamation

Nearly five centuries ago, an Italian navigator in the service of Spain opened the way to the founding of these United States. In this historic feat, Christopher Columbus embodied for us the qualities which we Americans hold dear and which are representative of us as a people: daring, determination, vision, and the courage to pursue a dream.
Although Columbus undertook his epic voyage long ago, his adventurous spirit continues to inspire us. As we reflect on the elements which made this journey one of the finest moments in history, it is fitting that we rededicate ourselves to our search for new horizons, ever mindful of Christopher Columbus and those brave seafarers on the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.
In tribute to the achievement of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), as modified by the Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), asked the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1982, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 8th day of Sept. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
