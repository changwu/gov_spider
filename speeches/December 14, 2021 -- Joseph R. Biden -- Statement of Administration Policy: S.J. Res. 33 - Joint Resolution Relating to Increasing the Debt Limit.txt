    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
The Administration strongly supports passage of S.J. Res. 33, legislation to increase the debt limit and preserve the full faith and credit of the United States. The Administration also appreciates the bipartisan support to authorize an expeditious process to complete this legislation.
Addressing the debt limit is a basic responsibility of the Federal government. Passage of this legislation will allow the Treasury to finance spending and tax cuts Congress has already authorized and to keep its commitments without causing disruption or harm to our economy and American families.
The Administration urges quick action to raise the debt limit and applauds the Senate leadership in fulfilling this fundamental legislative and constitutional responsibility.
