The stakes are so high for this next election. All conservatives know that. And I really think that Marco really represents the next generation conservatism who can truly unite and inspire this country."

I really think we need a president — I think Marco reflects this — who understands the unique challenges facing our people in this century. Look at his story — daddy was a bartender, his mom stocking shelves at K-Mart on night shift, working as a housekeeper for a hotel. If anybody understands the working class of this nation, it's Marco Rubio. Also, you think about his story of parents who are Cuban immigrants. This is a great American Dream story. And I've watched Marco up close here in the Senate. He is the kind of guy, both when the cameras are on, and importantly when the cameras aren't, he's approachable. You can work with him. He's a humble guy. There's a lot of character in Marco Rubio, and I'm honored to endorse him.
