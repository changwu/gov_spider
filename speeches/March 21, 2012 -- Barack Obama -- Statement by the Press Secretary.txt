    The President is grateful that the Senate acted in a bipartisan way to move forward key ideas the President proposed last fall that will help our small businesses and startups access capital they need to grow and create jobs. We are heartened by the important investor protections added to the crowdfunding provision and will be vigilant in monitoring this and other elements to ensure the overall bill achieves its goal of helping entrepreneurs while maintaining protections for investors. We urge the House to adopt these important changes.
While this vote marks a moment of bipartisan cooperation, there is much more work to be done to create an economy that is built to last, and we encourage Congress to act on additional measures like rebuilding our nation's crumbling roads and bridges, putting our teachers back in the classroom and first responders back on the beat, and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank which thousands of American businesses and their workers depend on to stay competitive in the global economy.
