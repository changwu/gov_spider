    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and rockslides during the period of April 14-15, 2007.
Federal funding is available to Commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and rockslides in the counties of Carter, Floyd, Johnson, Knott, Lawrence, Leslie, Martin, Perry, and Pike.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Jesse Munoz as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
