    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1989. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and computer sciences; in engineering; and in science and engineering education.
Achievements such as those described here are the basis for much of our Nation's strength -- its economic growth, national security, and the overall well-being of our people.
The National Science Foundation will be 40 years old in 1990. Over those years, it has played a key role in supporting this Nation's remarkable research achievements. The Foundation looks forward to the challenges and accomplishments of the new year, the new decade, and the new century.
George Bush
