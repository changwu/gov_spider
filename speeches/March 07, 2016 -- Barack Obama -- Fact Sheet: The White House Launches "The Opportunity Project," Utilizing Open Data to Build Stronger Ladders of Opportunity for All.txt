    In the lead up to the President's historic visit to SxSW, today the Administration is announcing the launch of "The Opportunity Project," a new open data effort to improve economic mobility for all Americans. As the President said in his State of the Union address, we must harness 21st century technology and innovation to expand access to opportunity and tackle our greatest challenges.
The Opportunity Project will put data and tools in the hands of civic leaders, community organizations, and families to help them navigate information about critical resources such as access to jobs, housing, transportation, schools, and other neighborhood amenities. This project is about unleashing the power of data to help our children and our children's children access the resources they need to thrive. Today, the Administration is releasing a unique package of Federal and local datasets in an easy-to-use format and accelerating a new way for the federal government to collaborate with local leaders, technologists, and community members to use data and technology to tackle inequities and strengthen their communities.
Key components of this announcement include:
• The launch of "The Opportunity Project" and Opportunity.Census.govto provide easy access to the new package of Opportunity Project data, a combination of Federal and local data, on key assets that determine access to opportunity at the neighborhood level. This data can now be used by technologists, community groups, and local governments in order to help families find affordable housing, help businesses identify services they need, and help policymakers see inequities in their communities and make investments to expand fair housing and increase economic mobility.
• The release of a dozen new private sector and non-profit digital tools that were built in collaboration with eight cities and using the Opportunity Project data to help families, local leaders, advocates, and the media navigate information about access to jobs, housing, transportation, schools, neighborhood amenities, and other critical resources. Participating cities include Baltimore, Detroit, Kansas City, MO, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., as well as organizations and companies such as Redfin, Zillow, GreatSchools, PolicyLink and Streetwyze.
• More than thirty additional non-profits, community organizations, coding boot camps, academic institutions, and local governments have already committed to use the Opportunity Project data to build stronger ladders of opportunity in communities across the country.
• The Administration is issuing a Call to Action to the public to develop new tools, offer additional sources of data, deepen community engagement through the use of the data, and other actions. We want to hear about what new steps you are taking or programs you are implementing to address these topics.

This project represents an important continuation of how the Federal government is working with communities and technologists to enhance the power of open data by making it more accessible to a wide variety of users across the country, and by facilitating collaborations between software developers and community members to build digital tools that make it easier for communities and families to solve their greatest challenges.
New Administration Announcements
• Launching Opportunity.Census.gov. This new platform provides easy access to the Opportunity Project digital tools, and for software developers and community partners to access the data, build new tools, and connects with others through a community of practice, facilitated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with the Presidential Innovation Fellows. The Administration launched this website to help ensure that an increasing number of users continue to collaborate with each other and take advantage of the Opportunity Project data. This interactive site invites software developers, data users, community leaders, and local governments to learn, connect and build as part of a larger community of practice. In addition, to support the long-term creation of applications and civic engagement, the Census Bureau created a new Opportunity Module for CitySDK, a software development kit that makes it easier to build products with open data from federal and local government. Both opportunity.census.gov and the CitySDK are open-source and available on Github.
• Release new, comprehensive and updated data on geographic access to opportunity. For the first time, the public, including software developers, local leaders, and community groups, can access a curated list of datasets compiled for the Opportunity Project. The data informs a new mapping tool created by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a resource for communities to make more informed, data-driven investments that expand access to opportunity and reduce segregation, fulfilling long-standing obligations under the Fair Housing Act. The data also includes: publically available data generated primarily by the American Community Survey from the US Census Bureau, the authoritative data source on our nation's population and economy; open data from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, Commerce, and Agriculture; and local datasets from eight cities, with information on community assets such as playgrounds, grocery stores, and health clinics. Cities include Baltimore; Detroit, Kansas City, MO, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
• Federal agencies will continue to engage with external developers, non-profits and community members to facilitate access to Federal and local data made available through the Opportunity Project, allowing for the development of additional tools specifically for particular populations and issue-areas. These may include LGBT youth experiencing homelessness, returning citizens experiencing re-entry challenges, unemployed and under-employed Americans searching for jobs, military veterans, people with disabilities, and rural communities.
• The U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Rural Development will enable youth to design digital tools that support rural community development. They will engage high school students in articulating the types of community assets that would attract them to remain and invest in their rural communities, and provide the results as youth-generated content for opportunity.census.gov to help other technologists partner with them to design digital tools. They will do this through a series of Opportunity Project focus groups on access to opportunity in rural areas at the Stronger Economies Together conference in September.
