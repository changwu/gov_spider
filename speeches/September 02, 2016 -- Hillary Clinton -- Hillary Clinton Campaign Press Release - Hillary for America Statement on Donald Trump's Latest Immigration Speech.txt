    Today, after Donald Trump's campaign announced he will give yet another speech clarifying his immigration policy, Hillary for America Chair John Podesta released the following statement:
"This is embarrassing to Donald Trump and offensive to people who are impacted by and care about the very serious issue of immigration. Trump is clearly just reacting to being called out by President Pe√±a Nieto and the Hispanic advisers he betrayed. He has shown us from day one who he really is. No rerun of his plan to deport 16 million people will change the fact that he's clearly a candidate in over his head."
