Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding the Independence Days of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua:
"Today, we express our best wishes to the people of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua on their Independence Day. We also celebrate the many contributions these communities make in the United States each day by upholding our mutual values and enriching our culture.
"During my business career, I had the privilege of working with several talented partners of Latin American descent, including Ricardo Poma and Miguel Due?as. I learned from these friends about their own families' suffering and the agonizing pain of tyranny throughout Central America.
"In recent years, we have seen dramatic progress in this region which was torn apart by civil wars and strife in the 1980s. As democracy and free markets have taken root, their people have been empowered to build more stable societies. Central Americans are right to expect their leaders to continue governing democratically and to reject the populist solutions that have failed them in the past. The United States must continue to support these countries' efforts to generate economic opportunities for their people, and we must work to ensure the Central American Free Trade Agreement is fully implemented. We must also cooperate to boost security in the region at a time when international gang violence and drug trafficking are threatening the gains that have been made.
"On this day, we also acknowledge these nations and their people for continued cooperation in the global fight against terrorists and radical jihad, including El Salvador's commitment to bring greater peace to the Iraqi people. We need to continue to build stronger alliances with our neighbors to together confront these and other threats."
