    Holocaust Memorial
Q. Mr. President, Voice of Israel, live—a word if I may. What did you put in writing in the guestbook, sir? May I bother you to approach the mike, sir, please?
The President. I wrote that today we are one step closer to the time when the people of Israel can live together in peace with all of your neighbors, the time when people of Israel will never again suffer death and destruction—the events that are memorialized here—simply because of their race or their faith, and may God let it come to pass.
President's Visit
Q. Mr. President, how would you summarize your visit in Israel?
The President. It was a wonderful visit. I was deeply touched by the reception of the people, grateful for the opportunity to address the Knesset. I leave redoubled in the support of the American people for the people of Israel and redoubled in my determination to continue until we have a comprehensive peace.
Q. What will be your message to your troops in Kuwait, sir?
The President. I'm very proud of them.
