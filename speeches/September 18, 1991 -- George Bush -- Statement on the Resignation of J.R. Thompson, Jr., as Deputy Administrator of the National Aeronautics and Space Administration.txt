    I have today regretfully accepted the resignation of J.R. Thompson, Jr., as Deputy Administrator of NASA.
During his distinguished 25-year career with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, J.R. has proven himself a man of exemplary dedication and vision. He played a key role in returning the shuttle safely to flight and restoring the integrity of the space shuttle program following the 1986 Challenger accident. In recent years, he has been at the forefront of setting the course for the Nation's space program for the next century.
Throughout his career, J.R. has had tremendous impact on our Nation's space program. From his initial efforts at improving propulsion engineering, to managing the Marshall Space Flight Center, to his most recent and notable position, J.R. has been a leader and an innovator. He has rightfully earned numerous awards for his efforts. Among his many honors, he has twice earned the Presidential Rank of Meritorious Executive and this year received the John F. Kennedy Astronautics Award from the American Astronautical Society.
Barbara joins me in wishing J.R. and his family the very best as we salute his proud service to a grateful Nation.
