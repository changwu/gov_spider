    To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1036, entitled "An act for the relief of Homer N. Horine."
This enactment would bring Homer N. Horine within the provisions of the pension laws conferring benefits upon honorably discharged members of the military forces who served 90 days or more during the War with Spain. I am advised by the Secretary of War that no record has been found of the enrollment, muster-in, or service in Company G, Fourth Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry, during the war with Spain, of any man named Homer N. Horine. The Veterans' Administration has no information as to whether Mr. Horine was or was not in the military service of the United States during the war with Spain except a statement from him in connection with a claim for pension based upon a short period of service in 1916 as a member of the First Regiment Kentucky National Guard, when that organization was called for border defense, to the effect that he had had no military service prior to 1916. He is now receiving a pension of $17 per month under a special bill enacted by the Congress after he failed to show a disability of service origin during his service in 1916.
It does not, therefore, appear that he was engaged in the service upon which this legislation is based.
