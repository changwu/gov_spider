    President Donald J. Trump applauds the House of Representatives for passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act â€” a big step toward fulfilling our promise to deliver historic tax cuts for the American people by the end of the year. We are working together to allow hardworking, middle-class families to keep more of their money, and to empower our companies and workers to dominate their global competition. A simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach. Now is the time to deliver.
