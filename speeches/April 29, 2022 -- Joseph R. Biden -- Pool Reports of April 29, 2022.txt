WH pool report #6b inspectors general meeting details
Pool was taken into the State Dining Room around 3:25pm, where Biden was seated at the center of the table, with Mitch Landrieu on his right and Shalanda Young on his left, and inspectors general gathered around them.
Landrieu, the infrastructure act implementation coordinator, talked about the importance of preventing waste and fraud in the infrastructure act funds and introduced Young, who said she had released guidance to federal agencies about how to implement the infrastructure plan. Gene Sperling and Inspector General Michael Horowitz also spoke briefly about preventing fraud and abuse, as Biden listened and paged through a binder in front of him.
Biden then told the group that Obama called him "Sheriff Joe" when the Recovery Act passed and that "less than 2/10ths of one percent" of that bill was lost to waste or fraud. He contrasted that to President Trump's handling of the CARES Act. "The first thing the president did at the time was fire the inspector general…what the hell happened?" He said that "an awful lot of people were getting unemployment checks" and there was "an awful lot of fraud."
He looked around the table and said, "In my administration the watchdogs are back and look at them … I really mean it."
"I want to make it clear to the press who's here—no one in my administration is telling the inspectors general what to do."
His remarks ended and reporters were hustled out, but Biden answered one question about whether he had a comment on the American killed fighting in Ukraine. "It's very sad. He left a little baby behind."
