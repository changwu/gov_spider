    Since August 6, Americans have followed the fate of six miners trapped in a Utah mine. We have prayed for their safety, asked God to comfort their families, and witnessed the unwavering commitment of their community. Our hearts broke when three brave rescue workers gave their own lives in the search for the missing miners.
The people of the central Utah mining community have inspired us all with their incredible strength and courage in the face of tremendous loss. Last night a difficult decision was made to end the search. Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men.
