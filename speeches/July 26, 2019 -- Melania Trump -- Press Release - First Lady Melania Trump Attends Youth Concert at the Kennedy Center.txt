    WASHINGTON, DC – First Lady Melania Trump attended the 2019 VSA International Young Soloists Competition concert this evening on the Millennium Stage at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Tonight's concert came from the Kennedy Center's Office of VSA and Accessibility, a Jean Kennedy Smith Arts and Disabilities program at the Kennedy Center that serves the international disability and arts community. The concert highlighted the talents of five young artists who performed two songs each for the audience.
The First Lady was joined by Deborah Rutter, Kennedy Center President. At the conclusion of the performance, Mrs. Trump assisted in presenting awards to each performer before joining them along with their families at a small reception.
"Thank you to the talented young musicians who performed tonight," First Lady Melania Trump said. "Music is such a powerful tool for communication and therapy. The arts not only help to provide a vehicle of self-expression for our youth, but teaches the importance of diligent practice and dedication in order to accomplish great things. Thank you to the John F. Kennedy Center for having me, and especially for providing your continued support to ensure that so many are able to enjoy the arts."
In line with her Be Best initiative, the First Lady continues to support and highlight programs that bolster the confidence of youth and that allow their passions to be explored.
