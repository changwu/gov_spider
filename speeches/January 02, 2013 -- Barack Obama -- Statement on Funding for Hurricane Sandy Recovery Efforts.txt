    It has only been 2 months since Hurricane Sandy devastated communities across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, as well as other eastern States. Our citizens are still trying to put their lives back together. Our States are still trying to rebuild vital infrastructure. And so last month, working closely with the Governors of the affected States, I sent Congress an urgent request to support their efforts to rebuild and recover. The Senate passed this request with bipartisan support. But the House of Representatives has refused to act, even as there are families and communities who still need our help to rebuild in the months and years ahead and who also still need immediate support with the bulk of winter still in front of us.
When tragedy strikes, Americans come together to support those in need. I urge Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same, bring this important request to a vote today, and pass it without delay for our fellow Americans.
