Chris Farrell Judicial Watch. 'They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...Retweets: 20982Favorites: 75260

Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate's August Recess. Great maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes. We need Border Security!Retweets: 19895Favorites: 88273

Great night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win. Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big much bigger than they ever thought possible. So much for the big Blue Wave it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!Retweets: 19546Favorites: 85754

The Fake News Media has been so unfair and vicious to my wife and our great First Lady Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death to facelift to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia to abuse. All Fake she is doing really well!Retweets: 26463Favorites: 124105

...Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting. They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever. Fake News is really bad!Retweets: 22197Favorites: 97195

Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible. The political pundits just don't get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! Remember Dems are High Tax High Crime easy to beat!Retweets: 20181Favorites: 81396
