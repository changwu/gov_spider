HOUSTON, Texas – Yesterday, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with Megyn Kelly to discuss the reports regarding Planned Parenthood's alleged practice of selling aborted babies' body parts.


Specifically, Sen. Cruz said:
"These tapings of Planned Parenthood selling body parts are grotesque. It really highlights the evil of what they are doing.
"Two things need to happen. Number one there needs to be a criminal investigation – there are at least three federal laws that are potentially violated. One, selling the body parts of unborn children for profit. Number two for any transfer of tissue, there has to be written consent from the mother. And number three, under federal law, you cannot change the method of abortion if you are trying to get tissue – in that tape, you see they are discussing different methods to capture.
"So I am calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate – has federal law been violated? And I am calling on state officials and – any location where Planned Parenthood exists – for state district attorneys, state attorneys general to investigate criminal conduct.
"And I'll say in addition, that I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe the Judiciary Committee will hold oversight hearings to get to the bottom of what they did. I chair the oversight, federal rights and federal courts subcommittee, and if the full committee doesn't hold hearings, I intend to hold hearings to get to the bottom of what appears to be barbaric practices being carried out by Planned Parenthood."
