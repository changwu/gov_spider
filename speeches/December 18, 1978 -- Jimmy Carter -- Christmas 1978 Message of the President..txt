    Rosalynn and I send our warmest wishes to our fellow citizens who celebrate the birth of Christ and who rejoice with us in the coming of the peace He symbolizes.
We welcome this opportunity to offer our thanks to those who have given us their encouragement and prayers.
We also join in this Season's traditional expression of appreciation to God for His blessings in the past year. And we ask for His continuing guidance and protection as we face the challenges of 1979.
We hope that the months ahead will be good to each of you and to our country.
