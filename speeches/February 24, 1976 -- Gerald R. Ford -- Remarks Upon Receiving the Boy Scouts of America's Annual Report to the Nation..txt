    LET ME thank you, Arch and Alden and left and David and Larry, for coming here to represent scouting.
I have many fond personal memories of scouting going back a good many years, not only as a scout--they didn't have Cub Scouts in those days--but also as a participant in the senior activities of scouting.
I think the fact that 60 million young men have participated over a period of 66 years, is indicative of the strength that scouting has contributed to a better America. I just hope that scouting goes on forever, because it is a great contributor to all of what we stand for in this country.
I hope that in the future there will be many Presidents who will be honored, as have been, by your presentations today. And I thank you, Jeff and David and Larry, Arch, as well as all of you. This has been a fine opportunity, not only to meet you but all of these outstanding young men and women who are here in the Oval Office on this occasion.
Good luck.
