    The heads of state and government of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have agreed to hold the next summit meeting in Tokyo on June 28 and 29, 1979, at the invitation of Prime Minister Ohira. The European Community will be represented by the President of the Council and the President of the Commission in sessions dealing with matters within the Community's competence.
The participants at the Tokyo Summit will discuss policies for the stable expansion of the world economy in the spirit of mutual cooperation that has been fostered by the previous summit meetings. Having reviewed progress on the five specific areas covered in their Declaration at the 1978 Bonn Summit, they will deal with current economic problems requiring immediate attention and will examine the basic issues that confront them in the longer term. Preparatory work is now going ahead on an agreed basis.
