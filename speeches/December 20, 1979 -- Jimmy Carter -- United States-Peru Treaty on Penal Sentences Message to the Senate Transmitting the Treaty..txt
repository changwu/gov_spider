    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, 1 transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States of America and Peru on the Execution of Penal Sentences, which was signed at Washington on July 6, 1979.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty would permit citizens of either nation who had been convicted in the courts of the other country to serve their sentence in their home country; in each case the consent of the offender as well as the approval of the authorities of the two Governments would be required.
This Treaty is significant because it represents an attempt to resolve a situation which has inflicted substantial hardships on a number of citizens of each country and has caused concern to both Governments. The Treaty is similar to those currently in force with Bolivia, Canada and Mexico. I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this Treaty at an early date.
JIMMY, CARTER
