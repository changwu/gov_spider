My dear Mr. McKelvie:
On my return to Washington I find your letter of June 15th conveying your resignation from the Farm Board. You already know how much I regret that personal affairs compel you to leave the Board and how anxious I was for you to continue.
You have contributed a real public service to American agriculture during your term on the Board which I know will be recognized by the farmers of the country.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Samuel R. McKelvie, Federal Farm Board, Washington, D.C.]
