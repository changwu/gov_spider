    AUSTIN â€” Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement regarding news that Texas gained 33,200 jobs in the month of May:
"Texas' May jobs numbers are a prime example of how a diverse economy that is unburdened by onerous regulations or unfair taxation policies can thrive despite a downturn in one of the state's most important industries. The 33,200 jobs added last month shows once again that Texas has an economy that is built to last."
