    On this day, we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II and honor the millions of brave Americans whose service and sacrifice vanquished tyranny and defended the American way of life. The American victory on September 2, 1945, marked the end of the most devastating war in history, securing peace and freedom across the globe.
Today, President Donald J. Trump designated Wilmington, North Carolina, as the country's first World War II Heritage City, highlighting the city and the state's exceptional contributions to the war. The Trump Administration will continue to recognize, preserve, and honor our important history and the sacrifices the Nation made to secure victory in World War II.
