    On #GivingTuesday, the citizens of our great Nation, and people around the globe, take part in the charitable spirit of the holiday season. We commit our time, money, and resources to acts of giving and kindness, as we help those less fortunate and those most in need.
Earlier this year, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria devastated communities across the southern United States and in the Caribbean, and vast wildfires ravaged California. We saw millions of our fellow Americans lose everything, from homes to businesses, and far too many people also suffered the unbearable loss of loved ones. I have seen first-hand the heartbreaking pain it has caused.
Americans, however, are a resilient people, particularly when they support each other through acts of charity, kindness, and generosity. That spirit has been on full display as we have worked together to rebuild America. As the process of recovery and the need for assistance continues, I encourage all Americans to unite in selflessness, compassion, and giving. When we are united, Americans can overcome even the greatest challenges.
This #GivingTuesday, I thank those who have contributed to charitable organizations, including our houses of worship, and ask that we continue to come together to give and help others in need, especially to communities devastated by the recent natural disasters. Together, we can ensure that the blessings of this holiday season are shared around the world.
