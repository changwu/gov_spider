    I am pleased that the Senate acted today to confirm Alice S. Fisher as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice.
Alice is a talented and effective public servant. As Acting Assistant Attorney General, she has led hundreds of DOJ attorneys and other staff in their efforts to combat terrorism, gang violence, drug trafficking, corruption, fraud, and crimes against children. I am confident she will continue to dedicate herself to keeping Americans safe from crime and bringing those who violate our laws to justice.
I continue to encourage the Senate to provide all of my nominees a prompt up-or-down vote.
