    President George W. Bush announced today that he has named Henry C. Lozano to be Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of USA Freedom Corps, which was established to build on the countless acts of service, sacrifice, and generosity that followed September the 11th, 2001.
Mr. Lozano served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Californians for Drug-Free Youth, a non-profit organization working to bring parents, youth, schools, and communities together to create and support safe and healthy communities. From 2003 until this year, Mr. Lozano served as a member of the Board of Directors for the Corporation for National and Community Service.
"Throughout his career, Henry has worked to ensure that more Americans understand the tremendous value of volunteer service," said President Bush. "As Director of USA Freedom Corps, he will continue to encourage citizens to serve a cause greater than themselves. I look forward to working with him to strengthen the culture of service, citizenship, and responsibility in our Nation."
Earlier in his career, Mr. Lozano served as Executive Director of the Santa Ynez Valley Network for Drug-Free Youth.
