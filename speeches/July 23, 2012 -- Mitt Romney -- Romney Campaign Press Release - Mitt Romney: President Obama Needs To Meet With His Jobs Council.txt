Watch Mitt Romney Discuss Why President Obama Needs To Meet With His Jobs Council

MITT ROMNEY: "I do remember that I was reminded the other day that the President has a Jobs Council as well. And this consists of leaders of various industries that come together to offer counsel and advice to the President. He has not been able to find time in the last six months to meet with them. And I would suggest having more meetings like this and with his Jobs Council and maybe with you guys or with his Jobs Council. It's like, 'Why won't he meet with his Jobs Council?' These are some of the largest employers in the country. They have perspectives on what it would take for them to hire people. And why it is they decide to build a facility outside the country as to doing what you've done, which is to grow in this country. The President needs to spend time with the Jobs Council. I guess in the last six months, he's done 109 fundraisers. He found time for that. I'd suggest between the fundraisers, get together with the Jobs Council and learn from people who are working hard to create jobs."
