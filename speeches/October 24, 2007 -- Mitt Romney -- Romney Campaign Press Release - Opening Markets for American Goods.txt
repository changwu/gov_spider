    The Romney Vision Vs. Democrats' Strategy Of Defeat & Retreat
"He talked about his business strengths as well as focusing heavily on the need for better trade agreements, less corporate taxes and energy independence as ways to keep the American economy strong. Romney said the country needs to understand that trade is good if it is done right." (John Boyanoski, "Romney Hits High Points With Business Crowd," Campaign & Elections, 10/23/07)
THE ROMNEY VISION: OPENING MARKETS TO HELP U.S. WORKERS SUCCEED
As President, Gov. Romney Would Open Foreign Markets And Promote Free Trade:
Gov. Romney Believes The United States Must Continue To Work To Open Markets To American Products. "Governor Romney is a strong believer in free trade and opening foreign markets to American products. While continuing to promote free trade, Governor Romney will also work to ensure that free trade is fair and there is a level-playing field for American products." (Romney For President, "The Romney Agenda: A Conservative Blueprint To Strengthen The Economy," Press Release, 10/9/07)
Gov. Romney Proposes A New Free Trade Zone Of Nations Committed To High Standards And Enforcement. "Starting with a core of U.S. free trade agreement partners, Governor Romney would seek to bring together nations committed to open markets and playing by the rules in the largest ever Free Trade Area, and go beyond traditional trade to promote high standards in areas critical to U.S. competitiveness. The Reagan Zone Of Economic Freedom would act as an alliance working together internationally, in the World Trade Organization and elsewhere to push reforms and work cooperatively in areas like labor and the environment." (Romney For President, "The Romney Agenda: A New Vision To Open Markets And Help U.S. Workers To Succeed," Press Release, 10/23/07)
Gov. Romney Recognizes The Need For Trade Promotion Authority To Open Markets. "We cannot afford to fall behind as China and others cut deals that hurt American exports and jobs. There are already over 300 agreements in the world that do not include the United States and place U.S. exports at a disadvantage." (Romney For President, "The Romney Agenda: A New Vision To Open Markets And Help U.S. Workers To Succeed," Press Release, 10/23/07)
Gov. Romney: America Must Reject The Democrats' Policies Of Retreat From The World. "Denying America the ability to negotiate to open markets while our competitors gain advantages is no strategy. Rejecting the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia, one of America's strongest allies in the world, would further show they have no understanding of the new global economy and America's leadership role in our hemisphere and the world." (Romney For President, "The Romney Agenda: A New Vision To Open Markets And Help U.S. Workers To Succeed," Press Release, 10/23/07)

Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) Is "Lurching Left" On Economics And Trade. "In crucial Democratic primary states, the anti-globalization fever is running even higher.

(MSNBC, AFL-CIO Democratic Presidential Candidates Forum, Chicago, IL, 8/7/07)

Former Sen. John Edwards (D-NC) Is Vehemently Anti-Trade.
