Dear Mr. Kozlov:
Thank you for the thoughtful message which you sent to me on your departure from the United States. I hope that you enjoyed your stay in this country and that you have returned to Moscow with a better understanding of our people, our institutions, and our way of life. It is gratifying to know that you have been impressed with the desire of the American people for peace, a desire which represents their strongest mandate to their Government. This ardent desire is also inseparably linked with our firm belief in the rights of peoples everywhere to enjoy peace with justice and freedom.
I share the hope that the increasing contacts between our two countries, which your visit to us and the forthcoming visit of Vice President Nixon to the U.S.S.R. so well symbolize, will lead to a greatly improved mutual understanding between our peoples.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
