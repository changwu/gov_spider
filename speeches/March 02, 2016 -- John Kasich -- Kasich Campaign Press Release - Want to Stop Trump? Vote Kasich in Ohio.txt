    John Kasich is the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in Ohio and block Trump from the nomination.
No matter how you cut it, election analysts say stopping Donald Trump from securing the nomination requires his losing the Buckeye State on March 15.
The most recent polls show John Kasich is the only candidate who can make that happen.
Polls from both Quinnipiac and Baldwin-Wallace recently showed a statistical tie for the lead between Kasich and Trump. Cruz and Rubio are far behind, ten points and 18 points, respectively. The BW Poll shows that even if the race consolidated and Cruz or Rubio had Trump one-on-one, they lose to Trump.
America needs John Kasich to win Ohio â€” and he will.
