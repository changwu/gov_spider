    The White House said today that President Carter would take no action to overturn the D.C. General Hospital Commission Act, which provides for an independent panel to administer the D.C. General Hospital.
The act was passed by the D.C. City Council by a 12-to-2 vote, overriding a veto by Mayor Walter Washington.
Under the Home Rule Act, any legislation passed by the Council over a mayoral veto goes to the President for a decision.
The President had 30 days after receiving the legislation February 11 to sustain the mayor's veto or to take no action to show disapproval of the act.
The bill now goes to Congress for a review period of 30 legislative days.
Under the act, the city's only public hospital would be removed from administrative control of the D.C. Department of Human Resources and placed under the control of a board of commissioners appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the Council.
A statement by the President follows: "The people of the District of Columbia share with the other people of our Nation a determination to improve such public services as health care and a desire to do so with the least possible interference from the Federal Government.
"The District is, of course, in a unique legal position. There are special responsibilities that I, as President, have for the District, and there may be cases involving Federal interests or true emergencies where I may find it my proper duty to intervene.
"But I believe that the people of the District, through their elected representatives, can best decide for themselves such questions as the proper way to provide high-quality health care. Therefore, I will take no action on this bill."
