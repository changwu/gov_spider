    The bipartisan Medicare agreement announced today by leaders in Congress represents a significant achievement in our Nation's efforts to provide affordable prescription drug coverage for our seniors. Seniors have waited a long time for help in paying for prescription drugs, and I am pleased that we are now on the verge of providing them with the help they need and the health care choices they deserve. This bipartisan agreement is the most significant improvement in senior health care coverage in nearly 40 years. I applaud the hard work and the leadership from both sides of the aisle, and I urge the Congress to pass this legislation soon so I can sign it into law.
