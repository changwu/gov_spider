    Today former Kentucky State Representative Jim Zimmerman announced his support for Gov. John Kasich for President and joined the campaign's Kentucky leadership team.
Zimmerman served three years of active duty in the U.S Army, receiving the Bronze Star and other decorations for his service in Vietnam. In 1988 he became the first Republican in the history of the state to win Kentucky's 59th House District, where he served as Republican House Whip. Before returning to the financial industry, where he has spent the majority of his career, Zimmerman served as Executive Director in the Kentucky Department of Labor under Gov. Ernie Fletcher.
Said Zimmerman, "Executive experience matters, and John Kasich is the only candidate in this race who understands what it takes to govern. No one comes close to matching his demonstrated ability to solve problems and bring people together. I enthusiastically support his candidacy and look forward to working with the rest of the Kentucky team."
Said Kasich, "It's an honor to welcome one of Kentucky's finest public servants to our leadership team in the Bluegrass State. I'm grateful for former Rep. Zimmerman's wilingness to share his expertise and knowledge of Kentucky voters and look forward to having him on board."
