FLOTUS Pool Report No. 1 - overview of Sunday 
Happy Sunday from Hawaii! FLOTUS has two events today – guidance is below – before we red eye back to D.C. Your pool was tested for COVID-19 this morning. We're gathering at the press hotel now and then will join up with Dr. Biden. More TK!
The East Wing sends this along:
The First Lady will tour a pop-up COVID-19 vaccination clinic at Waipahu High School in Waipahu, Hawaii, and encourage Hawaiians to get vaccinated. Hawaii Pacific Health will be administering the vaccines. Her visit is part of the Administration's nationwide effort to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus and highlight the ease of getting vaccinated.
The clinic will be open from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Hawaiian residents ages 18 years or older who receive the vaccine will be eligible to participate in the state-run #HiGotVaccinated incentive program, which includes $5,000 checks, holiday packages, and gift cards among other prizes. The clinic will offer Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Those getting their first shot will be able to receive their second dose at the same location in three weeks.
Carl Hinson, Director of Workforce at Hawaii Pacific Health, will serve as tour guide and provide brief overview. The First Lady will stop by the vaccination and observation areas. After the tour, she will deliver remarks. She will be introduced by Loise Medina, a 2020 Waipahu High School graduate. Governor David Ige will also provide remarks. There will be around 70 members of the community in the audience, including local elected officials, guests of the Governor, members of the Hawaii State Teachers Association, and members of the school community. Also attending will be; Mrs. Dawn Ige, and Mr. Keith Hayashi, Waipahu High School Principal. Hawaii Pacific Health, the health partner that will be administering the vaccine, is a private not-for-profit health network of hospitals, clinics, physicians and care providers covering Hawaii and the Pacific Region.
The First Lady will also attend a barbecue at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH). Approximately 75 service members and their families will attend. Because O'ahu is home to several military bases (including JBPHH, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Schofield Barracks, and Coast Guard Base Sand Island), guests at the barbecue will be comprised of representatives from all of the bases on the island, making for a truly "joint" event.
JBPHH is located approximately 15 minutes outside of Honolulu and provides services comparable to a large city for a population of more than 40,000 active duty service members from all branches, Guard and reserve personnel, family members, and retirees. In July 2013, then Vice President Biden and Second Lady Jill Biden attended a USO-affiliated BBQ at Pearl Harbor forapproximately 500 service members and their families.
The First Lady will be accompanied by Governor David Ige (D, HI) andMrs. Dawn Ige. She will greet with the following individuals:Admiral John Aquilino, Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command• Mrs. Laura Aquilino, Adm. Aquilino's spouse• Captain Erik Spitzer, Commander, JBPHH• Mrs. Brooke Spitzer, Capt. Spitzer's spouse• Command Master Chief Joe Lovelace, JBPHH Command Master Chief• Speaker of the Hawaii State House Scott Haiki (D, HI-26)• Ashley Cantero, military child and introducer

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 2 - Waipahu vaccination clinic protest 
Outside the school about 20 Trump supporters were gathered with large flags and signs. One man had a black and white flag that said "All Lives Matter" Another man wore a t-shirt that said "Trump won." One homemade sign said "no shots for tots." Another woman had a sign that had an x with a circle through the words "vaccine passport."
Two additional demonstrators had homemade signs showing support for the Cuban protesters.
Pool could hear the Trump people yelling outside as the motorcade arrived. "Go home," one man said. "Trump won," a woman screamed. Someone has a megaphone too, but their message was inaudible. "Protect Not Inject," said a homemade sign.
Also, in the previous pool report Scott Saiki's name was misspelled.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 3 - Waipahu event begi s 
FLOTUS entered from a different door of the high school gym as had been planned with the protest carrying on outside.
She entered at 1:15 p.m. She's wearing an ankle-length floral dress with shoulder cutouts. It's pink and blue. She's wearing her white floral mask from inauguration night. She's wearing Navy espadrilles.
FLOTUS was told by Carl Hinson that every one of the vaccinators are medical students today.
One of the medical assistants gave a teenage boy his second shot.
"That's good news, no reaction from the first dose," Biden said as the teen told that to the shot administrator.
"If you don't look, it'll be OK. I know that as a mother," Biden said to the teen's mom.
"Did you see how quick that was?" Biden said after the shot was administered. She and other people in the room clapped.
The Pfizer shot was given.
Another teen, a girl, who looks to be the sister of the first, was given her dose as well.
"Ahhh," Biden cooed as the mom and brother both held her hand.
"What a wonderful support system here," Biden said.
Biden moved to the front of the gym at 1:25 p.m. as people who had just received their shots looked on. Pool it out of earshot now.
Biden is touring the clinic with Gov. David Ige and his wife, among others.
She walked out of the gym at 1:28 p.m. to a smattering of applause.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 4 - remarks in Waipahu high school library 
The teens who got vaccinated are:Josiah Bartolome, age 12Christlyn Bartolome, age 15Their mother is Maria Bartolome
FLOTUS walked into the high school library at 1:55 p.m."Hi everybody," Biden said.
Gov. Ige introduced Biden saying "Aloha" and then "Mahalo." He's wearing a lei.
Also introducing Biden was Loise Medina, a Waipahu high school graduate and was a 2020 valedictorian. She's a Filipino immigrant. She's a certified medical assistant and has been administrating vaccines. She administered the vaccine earlier that Biden witnessed.
"If anyone wants to offer her a job," Biden said when hearing from Ige about Medina's recent graduation.
FLOTUS started out her speech by commending Medina for enrolling in community college.
"That's why the president and I are fighting for free community college for students like you across the country," Biden said.
"As many of you know, I'm on my way home from the Olympics. And while I was in Tokyo, I had a very special opportunity to dedicate a room to Senator and Irene Inouye," Biden also said. "What talented and special leadership you have sent to Washington on your behalf," she said, noting how Rep. Case and other greeted her yesterday at the airport.
She also complimented Gov. Ige and his wife Dawn.
"So let me ask, where are the teachers in here?" Biden continued. A few hands in the audience rose up.
"You have my heart and the heart of my president."
"I know you're just as excited as I am for those clean whiteboards and the freshly waxed floors and best of all the bright faces of our students I person, right?" Biden said.
"But before we start this year I just want to say thank you for all you did last year," she said.
"But some things – you know this – they just cannot be replaced," she continued.
"And that's especially true for students who missed out on sports and proms and school plays."
"I think that our world felt, I don't know, a little darker, a little colder."
"And now, doesn't the time we spend with those we care about just fill us with even more joy?"
She then turned to vaccines.
"Because Hawaii, your lives and your health matter to the president and to me."
"And this last push it seems the hardest of all."
She said we're now making the case "person to person."
"I'm here to ask everyone listening right now, to choose to get vaccinated."
She talked about how COVID has become "more contagious than ever."
"If you've only had one shot you need to get another."
"Help us move past this virus once and for all."
Speech attendees wore masks and their chairs were spread out to stay socially distant. The school's principal at the beginning of the program told the audience to adhere to COVID protocols including "no socializing."
People were socializing before the start of the event.
She concluded remarks at 2:13 p.m.
Now she's saying hello to attendees.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 5 - transcript 
**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenWaipahu High School | Honolulu, HIJuly 25, 2021
***
Aloha everyone! Thank you for welcoming back to Hawaii, now as your First Lady.
Where are my teachers?! Being with so many of my fellow educators always makes me feel right at home. You know you have my heart.
Can you believe it's almost time to begin the new school year?
I hope you're as excited as I am for those clean white boards… the freshly waxed floors… and, best of all, the bright faces of our students—in person.
But before we start this year, I just want to say thank you for all that you did last year.
It was difficult. There were times you probably wondered if you were going to make it through all the chaos.
But you did what educators do best: you made something out of nothing…you persevered and supported students…you took the uncertainty and challenges and turned them into something beautiful.
After all we've been through, it still feels incredible to be together today. Don't you agree?
So often, joy comes from our connection to others, shared from person to person.
As a teacher, I did my best to create a sense of community in my virtual class last year. But some things can't be replaced.
And that's especially true for students who missed out on sports, and proms, and school plays.
When we lost these connections, our world felt a little darker—a little colder.
Now, doesn't the time we spend with those we care about fill us with even more joy?
I want to thank the millions of Americans who have chosen to get vaccinated, and the clinics like this one that made it possible.
Hawaii has done a fantastic job of getting shots in arms.
But we're not done yet. There are still far too many people who aren't vaccinated.
And that's why I wanted to spend this time with you today. Because Hawaii, your lives and your health matter to the President and to me.
This last push is the hardest of all.
We need to answer questions and make our case to everyone who hasn't gotten their shots—person by person.
So, I'm here to ask everyone listening right now to please choose to get vaccinated.
Now, maybe you think you don't have time, I get it – you're busy.
But many places don't require appointments—you can just walk up and get your shot.
Or maybe you think that whether or not one person gets vaccinated doesn't matter.
Well, it does.
As we've seen, COVID is more contagious now than ever, and it continues to spread. Even one hospitalization—one life lost—is too many.
If you've only had one shot and you need another—get it!
Being fully vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself from hospitalization and death.
And to those who already have been vaccinated: Help us spread the word. Talk to the people in your life about why this important.
You are one of the most trusted messengers to the people you know.
Mind to mind, heart to heart, we glean, and gather, and grow together.
***
And that's how we will overcome this virus, as well. One mind, one heart changed at a time.
So, please do your part. Protect yourself. Spread the word. Help us move past this virus, once and for all.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 6 - arrival at barbecue 
FLOTUS' motorcade pulled out of the high school at 2:29 p.m. Pool didn't see her exit as we were pulled from the event as she met attendees at the conclusion of her remarks.
We arrived on base at 2:40 p.m. FLOTUS briefly met with greeters staged outside a main building in front of flags.
It's now 88 degrees and sunny.
We're now entering the barbecue. She's mingling.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 7 - barbecue remarks 
The barbecue is in an outdoor area on base next to a playground. A bounce house has been set up next to a basketball court. Pooler also spied a ladder golf set.
A solo singer is playing Hawaiian music on what looks to pooler like a ukulele on a stage behind the press. In front of the pool, four women in pink and yellow floral dresses with yellow leis are dancing as the first lady watched. The dancers are barefoot. For the second half of their performance they used what looked to be maracas that were made to look like flowers.
The podium says Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.
Admiral John Aquilino introduced Ashley Cantero, a 12-year-old military child who officially introduced Dr. Biden.
Biden – now wearing a purple lei – started her remarks 2:57 p.m.
Biden started by also thanking the spouses of those stationed at the Hawaii bases.
She brought up how she was the daughter of a Navy signalman and how son Beau was in the Delaware national guard.
Biden said this was the first event she's been at where all six services are represented.
She went through Navy, Army, Coast Guards and Marines.
"How about our Guardians?" she said, as several attendees in the Space Force raised their hands and cheered.
She spoke about going to the Olympics and said it was impossible not to feel enormous pride when you see "Simone Biles flying through the air and Sue Bird commanding the court."
"And so yesterday I got to see four events, I got to see women's softball, which we won, I got to see this great sport that I've never seen – 3x3 basketball … and we won. And then I got to go to the soccer game against the Netherlands and we won," she said.
(She misspoke, the match was against New Zealand.)
She then spoke about Joining Forces – something she renewed from the Obama years.
"Military families may not wear a uniform but you serve as well," she said.
"We're going to make sure you have everything you need to survive and thrive," she said.
She talked about how the military community is "bound together by love."
"God bless our troops and our families," she said.
Remarks concluded at 3:05 p.m.
She then said she'd come around and meet attendees
"If you have little kids and they want to go run, don't like hold them in their seats. I'm a mom and a grandmom I certainly get that, so please, but I'd love to come around and say hello," she said.
She's now socializing.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 8 - barbecue conclusion/rolling to airport 
Dr. Biden went table to table through the barbecue as the U.S. Air Force Band of the Pacific played Jackson Five, Beach Boys and a song from Moana.
One cute moment occurred when a baby grabbed for Dr. Biden's purple lei.
I'm also told the dancers earlier were indeed hula dancers.
CNN's Kate Bennett tells me Biden is wearing MISA Los Angeles
Pool was pulled from the barbecue at 3:47 p.m.
FLOTUS got in her motorcade at 3:52 p.m.
FLOTUS' motorcade departed the event site at 3:53 p.m.
We're rolling.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 9 - barbecue remarks transcript 
**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenJoint Base Pearl-Harbor Hickam | Honolulu, HIJuly 25, 2021
***Aloha!
As the daughter of a Navy Signalman in World War II and the mother of a son who served in the Delaware Army National Guard, I'm honored to be here.
I believe this is the first event I've had the chance to do with military families representing all six services today.
So where are my Navy families? Army? Air Force? Coast Guard? Marines? And how about our Guardians?***As many of you know, I just returned from the Olympics. While I was there, I had the chance to dedicate a room to Senator and Irene Inouye. And I was reminded of the incredible leadership that has come from this state: Senators Hirono and Shatz have been crucial voices in Washington… I saw Congressman Ed Case just last night…and of course, there's Governor Ige.
David, you've helped to bring this state through the darkest year in memory—thank you for being with us today.
I have always loved the Olympics. It's inspiring to see so many nations come together, even in this difficult time.
Every few years, our athletes have the chance to show the world the heart, determination, and courage of our country.
It's impossible not to feel enormous pride for the United States when we marvel at Simone Biles, flying through the air, or Sue Bird, commanding the court.***But every day, you show the world who we are as well.
Our military community is extraordinary. You're brave beyond comparison. Diligent in the face of multiple deployments.
You represent the United States throughout the world, and you fill us with pride.
And I don't just mean our service members.
Military families may not wear a uniform, but you serve as well.
You stand beside your spouse or parent, through every deployment.
You leave behind jobs and schools you love in the name of our national security.
You give back to your communities, even when you find yourself thousands of miles away from the friends and family that support you.***Military life is never easy—and that's especially true with the challenges of a pandemic. PCSes are chaotic, child care is hard to come by, and our military-connected students feel especially isolated.
Yet, you answer a call to duty, again and again, without complaint.
Military families sacrifice for all of us and you are as crucial to our military readiness as a rudder to a ship.
That's why supporting your physical, social, and emotional health is a national security imperative.
In the United States, we have an all-volunteer force—and it continues only because generations of Americans see the honor, dignity, and patriotism of military service.
Our troops can't focus on their missions if their families are struggling.
We simply cannot expect to retain even our most dedicated service members if they are forced to choose between their love of country and their love of family.***That's why Joining Forces—the White House initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors—is one of my top priorities.
We're working to increase military spouse employment and entrepreneurship… ensure you can get quality child care when you need it… and provide the education your children deserve.
We're going to make sure that you have what you need to thrive.***Our military is a community unlike any other. It is bound together by love—love for our country.
Love for the men and women who serve beside you…love for your service members—your husbands and wives, your moms and dads. And love for communities you build together.
It's our obligation and our honor to match your devotion. Because you deserve nothing less.
So, thank you for all that you do. Thank you for making us proud, every single day.
May God bless our troops and their families.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 10 - departure from Hawaii 
The motorcade arrived at Executive One Foxtrot at 4:04 p.m.
Motorcade ride was uneventful.
She stood on the tarmac taking photos with the governor, his wife Dawn and the military official who introduced her earlier. He then gifted her a ship in a glass case. She climbed the stairs at 4:09 p.m., turned around, waved and said "bye and thank you."
We'll be wheels up to JBA shortly.
