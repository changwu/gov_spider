    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on October 13, 1993. A related exchange of notes is enclosed for the information of the Senate. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol will prohibit a treaty abuse otherwise permitted by the Convention, which was previously transmitted to the Senate. The Protocol will prevent a Dutch investor in the United States from evading virtually all income taxes in both the United States and the Netherlands through a permanent establishment in a third, low-income jurisdiction. The Protocol and the Convention are intended to reduce the distortions of both double taxation and tax evasion. The two agreements will modernize tax relations between the United States and the Netherlands and will facilitate greater bilateral private sector investment.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol, together with the Convention, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 22, 1993.
