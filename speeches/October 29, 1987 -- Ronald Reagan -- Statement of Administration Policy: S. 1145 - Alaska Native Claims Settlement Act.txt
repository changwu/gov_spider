    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Reps. Murkowski (R) and Stevens (R) Alaska)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 1145 because it contains fundamental policy flaws. The bill would expand upon the intended permanent settlement of Alaska Native Claims established in 1971, create permanent racially-defined special economic and property rights, and could generate substantial litigation.
If S. 1145 should be enacted in its present form, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he disapprove it.
