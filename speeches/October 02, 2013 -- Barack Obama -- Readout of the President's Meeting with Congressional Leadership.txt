    Tonight, the President hosted a meeting with the members of the Congressional Leadership that lasted for over an hour. The President made clear to the Leaders that he is not going to negotiate over the need for Congress to act to reopen the government or to raise the debt limit to pay the bills Congress has already incurred. The President reinforced his view that the House should put the clean government funding bill that has been passed by the Senate up for a vote - a bill that would pass a majority of the House with bipartisan support. The House could act today to reopen the government and stop the harm this shutdown is causing to the economy and families across the country. The President remains hopeful that common sense will prevail, and that Congress will not only do its job to reopen the government, but also act to pay the bills it has racked up and spare the nation from a devastating default. The President is glad that the Leaders were able to engage in this useful discussion this evening.
