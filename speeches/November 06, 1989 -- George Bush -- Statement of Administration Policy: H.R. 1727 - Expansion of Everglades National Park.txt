    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 18 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1727. The Administration will seek changes in the Senate, however, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to undertake construction of necessary facilities to improve the water flow to the park, by providing funds to the Secretary of the Army to construct the facilities. The Administration will also seek an amendment to authorize the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Florida, to modify the operation of a nearby water project to improve the water flow to the park.
