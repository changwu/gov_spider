    Edwards Will Visit With Workers and Caucus Goers During Three-Day Trip
Des Moines, Iowa – John Edwards will return to Iowa during the Labor Day holiday weekend for a three-day visit. Starting on Saturday, September 1, Senator Edwards will visit with workers and caucus goers across the state at community meetings and other events celebrating America's labor movement. He will participate in the South Central Iowa Federation of Labor's Labor Day Fest on Monday in Des Moines.
"Labor has been the most important anti-poverty movement in American history and the best tool for strengthening our middle class and helping build One America," Edwards said. "I am looking forward to spending the weekend visiting with workers and caucus goers to discuss my plans to build One America where working families have a chance to get ahead, guarantee quality, affordable health care to every American and end the war in Iraq."
