    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kostmayer (D) PA and Ritter (R) (PA))
The Administration opposes H.R. 3957. The National Park Service already has adequate authority to coordinate and assist State and local governments in historic preservation and interpretation. H.R. 3957 would inappropriately expand the Federal role in what is primarily a local historic preservation effort. Moreover, under section 5(b), the Secretary of the Interior may not appoint an individual to the Delaware and Lehigh Navigation Canal National Heritage Corridor Commission without the approval of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and, therefore, this section unconstitutionally deviates from the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. In addition, Sec. 9(b)(3) of the bill would unconstitutionally authorize the Governor of Pennsylvania, who is not an Officer of the United States, to extend the life of a Federal Commission.
If enacted in its current form, the Attorney General would recommend veto of H.R. 3957.
