    President Biden's Build Back Better Act is the single greatest federal legislative action to combat climate change to date.
Its funding would create thousands of jobs in the clean energy economy, incentivize middle class families to shift to electric vehicles and bikes through tax credits and rebates, and emphasize environmental justice through inclusive investments in disadvantaged communities.
As we continue to battle increasingly extreme weather, the Build Back Better Act would also invest in climate resilience through coastal restoration, forest management, and soil conservation projects.
Yesterday, members of Congress and environmental advocacy organizations touted the unprecedented level of investment proposed in the Build Back Better Act to address climate change.
See below for what they are saying:

Congressional Progressive Caucus: "The Build Back Better Act has rightfully been touted as the largest-ever federal investment in climate action. But to meet this moment, Congress needs to be concerned not only about quantity, but quality. If the Senate eliminates every mechanism in this bill designed to push polluters into a clean energy future, we simply will never get there – and that is unacceptable. Today, we urge the Senate to resist the fossil fuel industry's efforts to remove basic guardrails on the tax credits for carbon sequestration. The House-passed version of Build Back Better requires fossil fuel emitting plants to store 75 percent or more of their carbon pollution – an eminently reasonable requirement, as the fossil fuel industry itself touts carbon capture's ability to achieve a 90 percent sequestration rate. But now, special interest groups are pushing our Senate colleagues to remove the requirement altogether, and provide a no strings attached taxpayer handout to the biggest polluters. For Congress to pass such a policy – especially as the South and Midwest are still recovering from the latest climate change fueled disaster – would be an insult to basic tax fairness and to every member of our communities demanding environmental justice. It's simple: a bill that aims to tackle climate change and rapidly decarbonize our economy cannot include gifts for polluters. President Biden has demonstrated leadership on the world stage in making the ambitious, yet necessary, commitment that the United States will halve its carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. In order to meet that mandate, our colleagues must oppose any efforts to remove the limited guardrails that currently exist on carbon sequestration subsidies and protect our national effort to rapidly transition to solar, wind, and other renewable energies. As the Senate debates the Build Back Better Act, this House-passed legislation's promise to address climate change at the scope of the crisis, and deliver on the President's transformational vision, must not be weakened." [Statement, 12/15/21]
"Right now, special interests are trying to gut Build Back Better's climate policies to create a no-strings-attached fossil fuel handout. Our Senate colleagues must resist. It's simple: a bill to tackle climate change and decarbonize our economy can't include gifts for polluters." [Tweet, 12/15/21]
