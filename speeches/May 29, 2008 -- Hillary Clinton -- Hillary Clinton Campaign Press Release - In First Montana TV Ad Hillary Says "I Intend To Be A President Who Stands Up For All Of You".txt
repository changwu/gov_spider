    The Clinton campaign today unveiled is first Montana television ad, "Only One." In the 30-second spot, Hillary says "it's time to level the playing field against the special interests," and states that she intends "to be a President who stands up for all of you."
The ad highlights that Hillary is the only candidate in the campaign who voted against the Bush energy bill, the only one with a universal health care plan, and the only who will end the 55 billion dollars in giveaways to corporate special interests and cut taxes for the middle class.
The ad will be being airing statewide today.

HRC: "I intend to be a President who stands up for all of you."
