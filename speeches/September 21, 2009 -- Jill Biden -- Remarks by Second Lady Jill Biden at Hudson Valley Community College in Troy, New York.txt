    DR. BIDEN: Thank you.
Good morning everyone and thank you.
I'm Jill Biden and I am honored to be a community college professor.
I've been an English teacher for almost 30 years, and I've spent much of my career on campuses just like this one. In fact, tomorrow I will be back in my classroom at a community college not too far from the White House. So I feel right at home here at Hudson Valley Community College.
People often ask me why I chose to teach at a community college. And the answer is simple: it is because every day my students inspire me -- with their commitment, their struggles, and their belief in education as the best hope for a brighter future for themselves and their families.
I have seen firsthand the power of community colleges to change lives and serve as a gateway to opportunity for students at all stages of their lives and careers. I know that the education gained on campuses just like this one will provide the knowledge that will power the American and global economies in the 21st Century.
President Obama knows it too.
I have always said that community colleges are America's best kept secrets - but this Administration has recognized their value from day one.
President Obama is making an historic and unprecedented commitment to higher education and bringing more students to colleges like Hudson Valley so, they, too, can gain the skills and the confidence they need to succeed in a new era.
I can't think of a better investment in America's future.
I'm proud to be here as a community college instructor - but I am especially proud to introduce a President who not only recognizes the value of higher education, but is committed to making it a reality for more Americans.
Please welcome President Barack Obama.
