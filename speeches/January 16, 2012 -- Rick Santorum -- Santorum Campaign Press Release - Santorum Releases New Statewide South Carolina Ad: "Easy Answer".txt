Myrtle Beach, SC - The Rick Santorum for President campaign released a new 30 second television advertisement entitled "Easy Answer" that will begin airing statewide in South Carolina on Wednesday.
Governor Romney and his SuperPAC friends - much like President Obama - have decided to use deception and false advertising to mislead voters. Rick Santorum uses clear contrasts based on records to differentiate his conservative record from the Massachusetts liberal record of Governor Romney.
Because unlike Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, Rick Santorum has never supported a top-down, intrusive government run health care program. Unlike Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Rick Santorum does not support taxpayer funded abortions. Unlike Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Rick Santorum did not support the Wall Street bailouts. And unlike Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Rick Santorum has been a proven fighter for the unborn and our nation's traditional values.
And unlike Governor Romney, Rick Santorum will put his name behind the ad rather than relying on his SuperPAC friends to do his dirty work.
All of this begs the question: why would we vote for someone like Obama when we can unite around a consistent, proven conservative like Rick Santorum?

Script: "Easy Answer"
Voice Over:
Obama supported the Wall Street bailouts... So did Romney.
Obama gave us radical Obamacare... that was based on Romneycare.
Obama's a liberal on social issues.
Romney once bragged he's even more liberal than Ted Kennedy on social issues.
Why would we ever vote for someone who is just like Obama?
When we can unite around Rick Santorum. And beat Obama.

I'm Rick Santorum and I approve this message.
