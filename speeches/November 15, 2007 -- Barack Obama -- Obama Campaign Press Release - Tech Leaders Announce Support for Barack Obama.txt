    Chicago, IL - Technology leaders across the nation today endorsed Barack Obama the day after he unveiled his innovation agenda at Google headquarters. These entrepreneurs, academics, and innovators are drivers in the effort to recapture American competitiveness.
"Senator Obama not only understands good tech policy, but he also understands the best policy so that tech can do some good," said Lawrence Lessig, founder of Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. "By committing to opening government data, an Obama administration would provide all of us the tools we need to make government work for us, and not for the special interests that flourish in the shadows of a nontransparent government."
"I want my kids to grow up in an Obama America - an America in which, as Barack Obama has said, we stop setting settling for what the cynics say we have to accept and reach for what we know is possible," said Julius Genachowski, Co-founder and Managing Director of Rock Creek Ventures. "An America with a President who will summon the nation to a common purpose, who will lead not by polls, but by principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; a President who will combat the common threats of the 21st century - nuclear weapons and terrorism; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. This is what Barack Obama has promised - they are his words. And as someone fortunate enough to know him for two decades, watching him gather extensive real-word experience and a record of great judgment, I am completely confident he will deliver on his promise."
