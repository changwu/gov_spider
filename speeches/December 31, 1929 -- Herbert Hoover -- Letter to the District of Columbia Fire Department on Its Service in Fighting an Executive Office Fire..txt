My dear Chief Watson:
I want you to know of my appreciation of the excellent service rendered by you and the men of your Department during and following the fire in the Executive Office on Christmas eve. It was a fine piece of work and I thank you sincerely for all your efforts.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
