    "Our friends on the other side, they complain about government all the time.They set it up as the enemy, it's government versus the people.
The last time I checked, the Constitution said,
'of the people, by the people and for the people.'
That's what the Declaration of Independence says" -- Bill Clinton, remarks in Santa Ana, CA, October 17, 1996
"...that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not vanish from the earth" -- Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863
