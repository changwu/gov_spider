    The President sent to the Congress on August 2 the U.S.-Soviet trade agreement for its approval as he said he would do during the Moscow summit. The agreement provides for reciprocal most-favored-nation tariff treatment.
The President stated in his transmittal letter to the Congress that the trade agreement, which will extend MFN to the U.S.S.R. and the Baltic States, in no way alters the long-standing policy of the U.S. of not recognizing the forcible incorporation of the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the U.S.S.R. or our support for their legitimate rights.
The Administration has decided to supplement the extension of MFN to the U.S.S.R. and the Baltic States with special provisions for the Baltic States. First, we will begin accounting for Baltic origin products separately from those originating elsewhere in the U.S.S.R. for trade statistical purposes. Second, we will also offer to the Baltic governments technical assistance in trade development and export promotion to improve our trade relations with them.
