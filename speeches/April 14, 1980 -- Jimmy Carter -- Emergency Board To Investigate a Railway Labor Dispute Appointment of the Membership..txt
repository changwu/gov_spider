(PATH) and certain of its employees represented by the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of the United States and Canada. The members are:
Arthur Stark, of New York City, who will serve as Chairman. Stark is an arbitrator who has served on other Presidential emergency boards. He is a former executive director of the New York State Board of Mediation and has served as president of the National Academy of Arbitrators.
Thomas G. S. Christensen, of New York City. He is a professor of law at New York University and has served on Presidential emergency boards in the past.

The Board will report its findings and recommendations for settlement to the President within 30 days from the date of the Executive order, which was issued April 12, 1980. The parties must then consider the recommendations of the Emergency Board and endeavor to resolve their differences without engaging in self-help during a subsequent 30-day period.
