    For over half a century, Merv Griffin entertained America. He was a man of innovation and energy who greeted challenges with laughter and determination. By following his passions and trusting his instincts, Merv became one of our Nation's best-known and most respected entertainers. He introduced Americans to a generation of talent on his talk show, created two of the most successful game shows in history, and led a thriving hospitality business. Merv was also a generous leader who gave back to his community, donating millions of dollars to provide abused children with safe haven and brighter futures.
Laura and I are saddened by his death. His family is in our thoughts and prayers.
