    I welcome Indonesia's important announcement at the opening session of the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference that they are "initiating the process of the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty." The United States thanks President Yudhoyono and the Government of Indonesia for its responsible leadership in the global effort to reinforce the nuclear nonproliferation regime. This is another signal that nations are joining a renewed effort to reinforce global nonproliferation, which advances the vision I outlined in Prague in 2009 and advances the security of the United States, Indonesia, and the world. Reinforcing the norm against nuclear testing will help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and support our efforts to pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.
The United States is committed to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to its early entry into force, and we will work with the United States Senate to help achieve advice and consent to this important international agreement. The United States stands ready to work with all states and encourages them to ratify the treaty and to help bring it into force.
