    Ad Highlights Hillary's Plan for the Troubled Economy
DES MOINES, IA - Continuing to build on Hillary's growing momentum, the Clinton campaign today launched a new ad in Iowa that highlights the big challenge of the housing crisis and Hillary's real solution to fix it. The ad is being released in the midst of Hillary's "Big Challenges, Real Solutions: Time to Pick a President" tour across the Hawkeye State.
The new 30 second spot, titled "President," spotlights the costs of the Bush Administration's inaction on the housing crisis and calls attention to Hillary's plan to freeze home foreclosures, freeze rates on adjustable mortgages and provide real tax relief for the middle class. The ad concludes by asking Iowans to choose a President that would not have missed any opportunity to solve this challenge.
