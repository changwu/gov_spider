    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the leadership team for Iowa Business Leaders for Rudy, led by Charese Yanney. Yanney is a partner at Guarantee Roofing, Siding and Insulation Company in Sioux City. The team will help spread Rudy's commitment to cutting wasteful government spending, restoring fiscal discipline and cutting taxes.
"Rudy is the strongest fiscal conservative in the race," said Paul Pate, Giuliani's Iowa State Chairman. "He demonstrated real fiscal discipline as Mayor of New York City by restraining government spending and cutting taxes. Our country will benefit from his vision and leadership."
Mayor Giuliani made his ninth trip to Iowa today, making a stop at Ross' Restaurant in Bettendorf.
During his eight years as Mayor of New York City, Giuliani helped stimulate the local economy by cutting taxes 23 times and turning a $2.3 billion deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus. As part of Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People, the Mayor pledges to restore fiscal discipline to Washington, while cutting wasteful spending and taxes.
