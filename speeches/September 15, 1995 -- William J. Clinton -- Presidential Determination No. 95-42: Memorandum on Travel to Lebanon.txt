    Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation 
Subject: Partial Resumption of Travel to Lebanon
By virtue of the authority vested in me by 49 U.S.C. 40106(b), I hereby determine that the prohibition of transportation services to Lebanon established by Presidential Determination 85-14 of July 1, 1985, as amended by Presidential Determination 92-41 of August 17, 1992, is hereby further amended to permit U.S. air carriers, solely through interline arrangements, to engage in foreign air transportation to and from Lebanon of:
a) passengers who are not U.S. citizens; and
b) U.S. citizen passengers who have received written approval from the Department of State for travel to Lebanon; and their accompanying baggage.
All other prohibitions set forth in the abovereferenced Presidential Determinations, including the prohibition on direct operations to Lebanon by U.S. air carriers, remain in effect.
You are directed to implement this determination as soon as is practical, with due regard to the safety of travelers going to and from Lebanon.
You are further directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
