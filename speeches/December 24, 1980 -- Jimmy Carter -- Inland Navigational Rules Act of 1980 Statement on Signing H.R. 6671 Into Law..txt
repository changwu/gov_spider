    I have signed H.R. 6671, the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980.
Traditionally, the United States has had three different systems of navigation rulesâ€”one for the Great Lakes, one for western rivers, and a third for other inland waters. International law created yet another. H.R. 6671 eliminates confusing inconsistencies by combining the three United States navigation rules systems into one and ensuring that the unified rules conform as closely as possible with the international rules to which this Nation agreed in 1972. These unified navigation rules will reduce the potential for confusion and thus lessen the danger of collision.
Credit for this achievement is deservedly shared by many. Members of the Coast Guard's Rules of the Road Advisory Committee, who represent a cross section of maritime interests, have worked selflessly for several years on a totally voluntary basis to reach this result. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for their dedication and make special note of the efforts of its Chairman, Gordon W. Paulsen, who tirelessly and effectively shepherded the development of these rules.
I wish also to congratulate the Congress, and especially Congressman Mario Biaggi, chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation. I am proud to sign this bill into law.
