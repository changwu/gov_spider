    Today, Judd and Kathy Gregg endorsed Governor John Kasich for President.
Governor Gregg said, "I am proud to stand behind my friend and colleague, John Kasich. We served together in Congress, and I know he is the strong, decisive leader we need in the White House. John has put forward the most positive and substantive vision to restore America's standing in the world, and as a governor he is uniquely qualified. No Republican will be stronger for our Party in November. John has a proven record in Ohio and as chairman of the House Budget Committee. He is the most trusted candidate to renew the American spirit, secure a better future for our children and empower individuals across the country to reach their God-given potential."

Judd Gregg was the governor of New Hampshire from 1989-1993. He also served three terms in the U.S. Senate where he was chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. He previously supported Governor Jeb Bush for President.
Said Kasich, "I am thankful to have Judd and Kathy Gregg on our team. They understand that executive experience and leadership count. We proved that in New Hampshire and I am proving that everyday on the road talking to the American people."
