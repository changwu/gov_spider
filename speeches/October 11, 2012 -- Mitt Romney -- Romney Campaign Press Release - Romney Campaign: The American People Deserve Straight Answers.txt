    Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign National Press Secretary, made the following statement in response to the Obama campaign's comments on the terrorist attack in Libya:
"President Obama's campaign today said that Libya is only an issue because of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. They're wrong. The reason it is an issue is because, for the first time since 1979, an American ambassador was assassinated and President Obama's foreign policy strategy of 'leading from behind' is failing. This administration has continually misled the American public about what happened in Benghazi and, rather than be truthful about the sequence of events, has instead skirted responsibility and dodged questions. The American people deserve straight answers about this tragic event and a president who can provide leadership, not excuses."
