COLUMBUS, OH - The Clinton campaign today announced its Ohio Leadership Council, made up of more than 100 elected officials and community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Ohio's March 4th primary.
"Hillary Clinton understands the challenges facing Ohio, and has put forward real solutions to turn around our economy and strengthen the middle class," said Governor Ted Strickland. "She is the only candidate to put forward a comprehensive plan to address the housing foreclosure crisis and deliver quality, affordable health care to every American."
"Ohioans know Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to get our economy moving again and repair America's standing in the world," said Rep. Stephanie Tubbs-Jones. "She is tested and proven, and she is ready to lead."
"With all of the challenges facing Ohio and America, we need a leader who can deliver real solutions on her first day in office," said Senator John Glenn. "Hillary Clinton will immediately go to work turning around our economy and rebuilding the middle class. She has the strength and experience to take on the Republicans in November and win Ohio and the White House."
