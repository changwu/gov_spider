    We condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrageous murder of Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the University of Central America, and the other Jesuit priests in El Salvador. The six priests and two university employees were killed by unknown gunmen earlier today. We understand that the Salvadoran Government has begun an investigation, and we will be watching this investigation closely.
