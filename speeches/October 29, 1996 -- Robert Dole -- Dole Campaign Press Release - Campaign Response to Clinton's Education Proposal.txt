    Christina Martin, Deputy Press Secretary for Dole/Kemp '96, released the following statement today:
"Once again, where's the beef? Bill Clinton's new Internet School report card claims to show parents which schools excel and which schools are lacking.
What Bill Clinton is not willing to do is give parents the choice of a better school or the opportunity to improve the schools which are lacking. Bill Clinton simply won't put America's children first and his campaign cash-cow, the teacher's unions, last."
