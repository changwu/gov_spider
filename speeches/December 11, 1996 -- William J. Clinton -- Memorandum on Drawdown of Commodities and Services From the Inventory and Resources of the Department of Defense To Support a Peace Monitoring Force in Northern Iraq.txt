    Presidential Determination No. 97-12
Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Drawdown of Commodities and Services From the Inventory and Resources of the Department of Defense To Support a Peace Monitoring Force in Northern Iraq
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by sections 552(c)(2) and 614(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) and 2364(a)(1) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national interests of the United States;
(2) an unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of assistance under Chapter 6 Part II of the Act; and
(3) it is important to the security interests of the United States to furnish up to $4 million of commodities and services from the inventory of the Department of Defense to support a Peace Monitoring Force in northern Iraq, without regard to any provision of law within the scope of section 614(a)(1) of the Act, including various restrictions on providing assistance to Iraq.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $4 million to support a Peace Monitoring Force in northern Iraq.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
