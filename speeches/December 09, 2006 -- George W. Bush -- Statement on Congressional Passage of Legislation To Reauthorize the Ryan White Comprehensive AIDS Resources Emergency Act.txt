    In 1990, Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act to advance our domestic battle against HIV/AIDS. This landmark legislation has provided Americans in need with better access to medical care, antiretroviral treatments, and counseling and has helped them live longer lives. The act also supports HIV testing to prevent the further spread of this devastating disease.
Laura and I thank the House and Senate for reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act. This legislation focuses on lifesaving and life-extending services and increased accountability and will provide more flexibility to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to direct funding to areas of greatest need. The Ryan White CARE Act demonstrates the compassionate and generous spirit of America, and I look forward to signing this important legislation into law.
