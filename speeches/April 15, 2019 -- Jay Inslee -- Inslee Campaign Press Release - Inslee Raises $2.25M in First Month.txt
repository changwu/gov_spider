    Q1 Filing Today Shows $2M Raised; Meets 200 Donors in 20 States Debate Requirement
Seattle â€“ Today, Inslee for America announced it has raised over $2.25 million since Governor Jay Inslee joined the race on March 1.
With $2.25 million raised in just a month, Inslee's daily fundraising average outpaced better-known candidates such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ($3 million in 2.5 months), Elizabeth Warren ($6 million in 3 months), and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro ($1.1 million in 3 months).
Gov. Inslee's campaign was propelled by grassroots donors who want to see climate change as the top priority for the next president. Of all campaign contributions, 75% of contributions are $25 or below and 95% of donations are $100 or under.
"This first-month fundraising shows strong grassroots momentum for Gov. Inslee's message of defeating climate change," said Aisling Kerins, Inslee's campaign manager. "Jay Inslee is the only 2020 candidate who will make climate change the top priority. That clear message allowed Gov. Inslee's upstart campaign to raise money at a faster clip than many better-known candidates. We will continue to build momentum, as voters look for a candidate who will prioritize climate change and who has the executive experience to defeat Trump and advance a progressive agenda in the White House."
Inslee's campaign has met the 200 donors in 20 different states requirement for DNC debates.
The $2.25 million includes approximately $2 million in primary election funding and $285,000 in general election funding.
Inslee, who is the only presidential candidate who has made defeating climate change the cornerstone of his campaign, has been making stops to speak with voters across the country as part of his "Climate Mission Tour." Since launching his campaign on March 1st, he has visited Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, California, New York, and Oregon.
