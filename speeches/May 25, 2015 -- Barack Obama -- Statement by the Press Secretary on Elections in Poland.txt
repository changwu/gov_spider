    We congratulate President-elect Andrzej Duda on his election in Poland's May 24 presidential election, and we applaud the people of Poland for remaining a model of freedom and democracy in the region through their election process. We also thank President Bronislaw Komorowski for his support for Polish-U.S. ties and for his strong leadership in the region. Poland is one of our closest transatlantic partners and a stalwart NATO Ally, and we look forward to working with President-elect Duda to advance our shared values and to build a more democratic, prosperous, and secure region, and to deepen the already strong partnership between our two countries and peoples in the years to come.
