    Jill and I are deeply saddened by the loss of a true civil rights hero, Benjamin Hooks. As head of the NAACP from 1977-1992, and throughout a distinguished legal career, his voice stood out among a generation of African-American men and women seeking together to eliminate racism and create a fairer, more just America for our nation's children than the one Benjamin inherited as a child in Memphis, Tennessee. He was an ordained minister and he used the power of faith to inspire others to believe in the importance of civil rightsâ€”not just for the sake of black men and women, but for America as a whole. Benjamin once said that, "You can read the history of a country through its actions." Benjamin's actions helped write a better history. Those who follow his lead will help build a better future.
