    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House and Senate)(Anderson (D) California and 65 others)
The administration opposes approval of the conference report because of its numerous objectionable provisions, as detailed in Statements of Administration Policy on H.R. 2 and S. 387 sent to Congress earlier. If the conference bill is presented to the President for signature, the President's senior advisers will recommend that he veto the bill.
The conference bill's objectionable provisions include, but are not limited to, its: (1) excessive authorization levels, especially for mass transit; (2) continuation of inequitable and inappropriate allocation of trust-funded transit funds to relatively few cities; (3) mandatory funding for numerous special interest transit and highway projects; and (4) provisions expanding domestic content requirements for transit.
