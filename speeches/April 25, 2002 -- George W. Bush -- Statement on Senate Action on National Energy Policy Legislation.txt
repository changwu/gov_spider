    The Senate today passed legislation that includes many of the provisions called for in my administration's national energy policy. Together, the House and Senate energy bills include the major conservation and environmentally responsible production measures needed to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy.
I am pleased that the House-Senate conference committee will have before it the elements of a comprehensive energy policy. The two bills reflect my administration's call to provide tax incentives for alternative and renewable fuels and technology; modernize our electricity laws; open a small portion of ANWR to responsible exploration; increase automotive fuel efficiency while protecting American lives and jobs; and ensure continued safe operation of our nuclear facilities.
It is imperative that America increase its energy independence, and I look forward to working with the conferees to ensure that we enact a balanced and comprehensive energy policy this year.
