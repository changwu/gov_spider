    The President today appointed Phil Lader, a South Carolina businessman and educator, to be the Office of Management and Budget's Deputy Director for Management. As the senior administration official directly responsible for cutting waste and inefficiency in Government operations, Lader will play a key role in the President's efforts to reinvent Government.
"We must streamline the operations of the Federal Government," said President Clinton. "We must squeeze every penny that we have out of the Government before we ask ordinary Americans to contribute to deficit reduction. Phil Lader has my complete confidence. I trust his ability to find every way possible to carry out my mandate of slashing the executive costs of Government."
