    Des Moines, IA -- The Obama for America campaign today unveiled an interactive online Iowa caucus education center to help empower Iowans who want to support Senator Obama's campaign for real change in Washington. The new tools complement the face-to-face caucus education program that Obama field organizers have been conducting with first time caucusgoers of all ages for months. The caucus education center can be found here: http://Iowa.BarackObama.com/caucus.
"This comprehensive online resource will offer Iowans of all ages the information they need to stand for Barack Obama on Thursday, January 3 and help him bring the kind of change our country can believe in," said Nick Kimball, Obama's Iowa New Media Director.
The caucus center has several elements:
* A short video, hosted by former Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Gordon Fischer, lays out the basics of the caucus process.
* Animated graphics that explain step-by-step what will happen on caucus night.
* A caucus location finder. As soon as caucus locations are finalized by the Iowa Democratic Party, caucus-goers will be able to enter their home address to find their caucus location.
* A form to request help with child care or transportation on caucus night.
* An interactive caucus math tool. With this tool, caucus-goers can set up "virtual caucuses" and see firsthand how caucus math affects the final delegate count.
"We've been meeting individually with our supporters for several months to make sure they have the knowledge they need to participate in the caucuses," said Kimball. "These new resources complement those efforts, and will help us turn the enthusiasm we've seen into organization and support for Barack Obama on January 3."
The campaign also unveiled a new field office mapping function today, which locates each of the campaign's 35 field offices on a map of Iowa. The interactive mapping function allows users to navigate the state and learn about the Obama campaign organization in local areas by viewing:
* Pictures of local offices
* Local office contact information
* Pictures and video associated events in the local area
Users can also sign up to get involved with local Obama campaign activities by filling out a form linked to each office. The office map can be found here: http://Iowa.BarackObama.com/IAOffices.
