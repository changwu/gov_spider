    CITATION
JAMES FORBIS BROWNLEE
FOR HIS LIFETIME of public service, the people of the United States owe to James F. Brownlee their profound thanks.
In World War II and the Korean War, Mr. Brownlee occupied governmental positions of great responsibility and contributed markedly to the success of the Nation's efforts. During the past two decades, at critical periods in our national life, in war and peace, he has repeatedly contributed to the Federal Government counsel and strength of outstanding value.
For exceptionally meritorious conduct and outstanding performance on behalf of his countrymen, I cite this record of a patriot.
