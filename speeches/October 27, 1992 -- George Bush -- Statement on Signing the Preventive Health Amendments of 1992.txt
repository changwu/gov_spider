    Today I am signing into law H.R. 3635, the "Preventive Health Amendments of 1992." The primary purpose of this legislation is to authorize appropriations for, and make amendments to, the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (Prevention Block Grant) administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
My Administration is committed to the importance of preventive health services. Support of prevention programs is a sound investment in our future. H.R. 3635 authorizes programs that will provide States with funding needed to target their prevention efforts as effectively as possible toward reducing some of the Nation's most pressing health problems.
H.R. 3635 will authorize appropriations through fiscal year 1997 for the Prevention Block Grant. This block grant is important for funding activities intended to achieve the national health objectives for the year 2000. The Prevention Block Grant represents an effective means of financing activities designed to reduce the burden of disease and premature death in this country.
This legislation will also continue HHS programs to prevent lead poisoning in children. Lead poisoning is the most common and societally devastating environmental disease of young children. This program enables us to identify children who have lead levels in their blood high enough to impair their health and to refer them to the help they need.
I am gratified to see health legislation that focuses on prevention. I applaud the cooperative effort that made it possible.
