Only 5,000 signatures were required — and the campaign did it all with just strong volunteer support, rather than shelling out tens of thousands of dollars to consulting companies.

Delegate Tim Hugo, Marco's Virginia Chairman, had this to say about the massive effort:
We are honored to be here today to present the work of hundreds of volunteers from across the Commonwealth to place Marco Rubio on the ballot for the March 1 Primary. These volunteers responded to Marco's positive message for a strong and prosperous America whose best years are ahead. The fact that we did not pay for a single signature speaks volumes about the grassroots support for Marco and his vision for a New American Century.

Hugo was joined by House Majority Leader Kirk Cox, co-chairs Chris Nolen and Jim Beamer, and top petition circulators Nadira Berry and Marty Schildwachter. Virginia conservatives took note of Marco's volunteer-driven effort:
Glad that @marcorubio will be on the @VA_GOP primary ballot. His grassroots presence has been very impressive this cycle. #RPV #tcot

Using all volunteers doesn't just show enthusiasm — it saves the campaign some serious coin, a constant priority for Team Marco.
