    Sir Winston:
This is a great honor indeed to welcome you once more to the United States. I do so not only as my dear friend of wartime days but as one who is, after all, half American himself. We think it is only fitting that you should come and visit this country which--after all--claims at least the maternal side of you.
So, welcome again, and we do hope you enjoy your trip here to this country.
