    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Rogers (R) AL and 32 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3966, which would help support our military by making clear that colleges and universities must give military recruiters access to campus and to students that is at least equal in quality and scope as that provided to any other employer. The bill expands the list of covered Federal funds that would be denied to an institution of higher education if the Secretary of Defense determines that the college or university prohibits or prevents equal access for military recruiters. H.R. 3966 also requires annual verification from colleges and universities that already support ROTC programs that they will continue to do so in the upcoming academic year. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to make appropriate modifications to the bill as it moves through the legislative process.
