In-town Pool report #7: Leaving Church
?POTUS/FLOTUS, masked, left Church at 6:25pm to cheers from onlookers. They waved at a trio of young ladies standing on their stoop directly across the street (SS wanded them before POTUS came outside), which prompted some screams of delight.
Others came out of their homes as well, or stopped walking the street to see what was going on. One family peered out of their second floor windows, cell phones out, to check out the scene. Down the street from the Church, a small crowd had also gathered by the time mass ended.
We're rolling back to campus.
