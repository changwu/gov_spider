    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1696, a bill to expedite the construction of the World War II memorial in the District of Columbia. It is indeed fitting that this measure becomes law on Memorial Day.
This legislation will allow the Nation to express the appreciation due the World War II generation for their selfless sacrifices that preserved the freedoms we all enjoy. I commend the Congress for a truly bipartisan effort to expedite construction of the memorial.
Now that debate over the site and basic design is concluded, the time has come for all concerned with the creation of the memorial to act with the same determination and sense of common purpose so wonderfully displayed by those we honor. We must get the job done, so that those who served are able to see the Nation's permanent expression of remembrance and thanks.
