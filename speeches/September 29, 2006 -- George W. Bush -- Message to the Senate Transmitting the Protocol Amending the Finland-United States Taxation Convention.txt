    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Finland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, signed at Helsinki May 31, 2006 (the "Protocol"). Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol eliminates the withholding tax on certain cross-border dividend payments. Like a number of recent U.S. tax agreements, the proposed Protocol provides for the elimination of the withholding tax on dividends arising from certain direct investments and cross-border dividend payments to pension funds. The Protocol also eliminates the withholding tax on cross-border royalty payments. In addition, the Protocol modernizes the Convention to bring it into closer conformity with current U.S. tax-treaty policy, including strengthening the treaty's provisions preventing so-called treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, September 29, 2006.
