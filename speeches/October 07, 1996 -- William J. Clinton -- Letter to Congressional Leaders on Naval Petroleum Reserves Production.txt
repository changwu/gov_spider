    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422(c)(2)), I am informing you of my decision to extend the period of production of the naval petroleum reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 1997, the expiration date of the currently authorized period of production.
Attached is a copy of the report investigating the necessity of continued production of the reserves as required by section 201(3)(c)(2)(B) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. In light of the findings contained in that report, I certify that continued production from the naval petroleum reserves is in the national interest.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
