Meanwhile, according to Gallup's editor in chief Frank Newport, Governor Romney's lead on a national level is "collapsing."
Gallup's top editor told MSNBC this morning that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's lead in the polls is "collapsing" across the nation, citing polling numbers that have changed dramatically over the last few days.
Frank Newport, Gallup's editor in chief, appeared on the MSNBC's "Jansing & Co." to share the results of Gallup's national tracking poll. The gap between Romney and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is quickly closing, according to that poll.
"We'll see this gap closing more," said Newport. "Romney was up 23 points over Newt Gingrich. Now it will be down about 10 points. So clearly, things are collapsing."
