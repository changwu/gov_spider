    Ten years ago, Danielle Gray put a promising legal career on hold to join my campaign for the U.S. Senate, and I will always be grateful that she did. Over the past decade, I've come to rely on Danielle's brilliant legal mind, her mastery of complex policy, her sense of humor, her fundamental decency, and her passionate, persistent understanding of the hopes, dreams, and challenges of the Americans we have the privilege to fight for.
Danielle has been instrumental in shaping policies that have helped grow our economy and create good jobs, ensuring that our veterans get the economic opportunities they deserve, helping to craft my "American Jobs Act" proposal, and confirming two extraordinarily qualified women to the Supreme Court. And over the past year, as Cabinet Secretary and a close adviser to me, she has not only helped make sure every agency in the Federal Government remains focused on giving hard-working Americans a fair shot at opportunity, but that our policies reflect the values we have always fought for. While I will miss Danielle, I will continue to rely on her counsel, and I look forward to watching her help push our legal system and our country in the direction of justice for years to come.
