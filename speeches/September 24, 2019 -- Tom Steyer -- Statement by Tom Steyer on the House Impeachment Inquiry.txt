    (SAN FRANCISCO, September 24, 2019) — Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the statement below after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the U.S. House of Representatives will launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.
"I started Need to Impeach almost two years ago because I believed it was important to protect our country from this lawless president. Over 8 million Americans joined in that effort and today their voices are being heard loud and clear — this is their victory. I applaud Speaker Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump's criminal behavior. No one, not even the President, is above the law and he must be held accountable.
"Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what's right, not what's politically convenient. We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning."
