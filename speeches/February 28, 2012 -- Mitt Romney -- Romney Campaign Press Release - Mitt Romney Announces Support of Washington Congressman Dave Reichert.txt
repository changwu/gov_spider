    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Washington Congressman Dave Reichert.
 
"Congressman Reichert has served his community with distinction and it is an honor to have his support," said Mitt Romney. "I look forward to working with him and the rest of my growing Washington team so that we can defeat President Obama and bring jobs back to Washington State."
 
Announcing his support, Congressman Reichert said, "Right now, we are missing real leadership in the White House. President Obama has had many failed policies over the last three years and Americans deserve better. Mitt Romney has been a successful leader and has shown that commonsense, real world experience can be used to turn around tough situations. Our economy and country need a new direction and I believe that Mitt Romney is the person with the background and skills to lead our country back on the right path. On March 3rd, I urge Washingtonians to support Mitt Romney — with a leader like him in the White House, we can be confident of a bright future."
