    Castor and Frankel Make 7 Florida Members of Congress to Endorse Biden
Today, Florida Congresswomen Kathy Castor of Tampa and Lois Frankel of West Palm Beach released the following statements endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I confidently endorse Joe Biden for President. Here in Florida and Tampa Bay, we know Joe. Vice President Biden will fight to lift wages, make health care more affordable and accessible, ensure a healthy environment for future generations, and equal opportunity for all Americans. Joe Biden is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump and restore the dignity and respect in the White House that Americans deserve," said Congresswoman Kathy Castor.
"Joe Biden is the candidate who can win Florida and help Florida Democrats win down ballot. At a moment when our state legislators and governor are fighting against voting rights, gun safety, and access to health care, we need a leader at the very top of the ticket who won't just help us halt these attacks on everyday Floridians, but also help us gain seats and political power across the state. Joe Biden has the coalition, message, and leadership that can help Florida Democrats do just that, which is why I'm endorsing him for president," said Congresswoman Lois Frankel.
Today's slate joins more than 45 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, and current Members of Congress Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23), Al Lawson (FL-5), Frederica Wilson (FL-24), Alcee Hastings (FL-20), and Charlie Crist (FL-13). Biden also has the most support from more Members of Congress of any candidate in the race with 58 members backing him. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
