CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS: "What do you hope to achieve over this next week in Tampa?"
MITT ROMNEY: "Well, I'd like people to stand back and say what are the big issues that America faces. And what are the answers that I have and that Paul Ryan has for the issues that we face. And I believe that if people stand back and consider all that America has to deal with going forward, they'll recognize that we're the only team that has answers for these challenges. And they're big and bold answers. America needs that kind of help at a time when so many people are out of work or underemployed or having a hard time making ends meet."
WALLACE: "If voters take away one thing from your big acceptance speech on Thursday night, what do you want that to be?"
ROMNEY: "That I believe in America and in the American people. That I believe that this nation is unique and exceptional and that we have everything we need to continue to lead the world in prosperity and in peace."
