    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the Office and Professional Employees International Union. OPEIU represents more than 125,000 members in the professional, technical and administrative fields.
"America's working families need a leader with Hillary Clinton's strength and experience to bring about real change," said OPEIU International President Michael Goodwin. "Her strong Senate record and longtime commitment to working families make her the clear choice for OPEIU and our members."
"I am honored to have the support of the hard working men and women of the Office and Professional Employees International Union," Clinton said. "Together, we will ensure that America's working families are no longer invisible to the President of the United States."
Clinton has received strong support from major unions representing more than 4 million working families nationwide. Her endorsements include the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; International Associations of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Transportation Communications Union; National Association of Letter Carriers; International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers; American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers; and the Amalgamated Transit Union.
