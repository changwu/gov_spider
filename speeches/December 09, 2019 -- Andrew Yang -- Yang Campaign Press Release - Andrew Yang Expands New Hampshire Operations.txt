    KEENE, NH â€” Following Andrew Yang's recent trip to New Hampshire, when he opened a new office in Manchester, the campaign is now adding new offices in Keene and Salem as well, bringing the total number of offices in the Granite State to 10.
This comes at a time when other campaigns are scaling back resources and cutting staff to stay in the race, in a state where Andrew Yang has visited nearly two dozen times during this election cycle.
"This is further testament to Andrew Yang's commitment to the Granite State," said New Hampshire State Director Khrystina Snell. "We are in it to win it. Andrew Yang's vision of a New Way Forward is on full display in New Hampshire, where efforts such as the Pledge For Humanity initiative see our supporters going out into the neighborhoods and helping their fellow human beings. This campaign has always been about people: their needs, their concerns, their families, their values, and their future."
