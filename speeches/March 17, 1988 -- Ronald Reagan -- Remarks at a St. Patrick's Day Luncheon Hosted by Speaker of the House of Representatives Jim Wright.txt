    Well, Seamus Wright— [laughter] —I'11 keep this brief. On St. Patrick's Day, you should spend time with saints and scholars, so of course, you know, I have two more stops I have to make. [Laughter] I turned back to the ancient days of Ireland to find a suitable toast, and I think I have found it. St. Patrick was a gentleman who through strategy and stealth drove all the snakes from Ireland. Here's toasting to his health-but not too many toastings lest you lose yourself and then forget the good St. Patrick and see all those snakes again. [Laughter] I believe that, you know, let those who love us, love us, and those who don't love us, let God turn their hearts. And if He won't turn their hearts, let Him turn their ankles so we'll know them by their limp. [Laughter]
May you have warm words on a cold evening and a full moon on a dark night and a smooth road all the way to your door.
