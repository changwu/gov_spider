    Today, Biden for President announced new spanish language and bilingual ads demonstrating the negative impact Trump's failed response to the pandemic has had in Latino families across the country. The ads showcase how a Biden-Harris Administration will take clear steps to get the virus under control and bring back jobs to help working families.
"No Escucha" is a Spanish language ad that will air on television and digital in Arizona, laying out Trump's failure to help small businesses. The ad highlights a Latina small businesses owner, Silvana, who calls the Latino community a deciding factor this November and encourages the community to vote for Joe Biden who will support small businesses and restore healthcare.
Additionally, "Si Se Puede, Hope Again" is a bilingual digital ad in Arizona that expands on Silvana's personal story and her economic and health care struggles. The ad emphasizes how electing Joe Biden will restore her faith in government.
In Florida, a Spanish language ad "Un Buen Plan" will air on television and digital and emphasizes how Hispanic families are facing the highest rate of COVID infections and unprecedented job losses as a result of Trump's failed response to the pandemic. It contrasts with Joe Biden's call for a nationwide mask mandate and how his plan will help ensure financial support reaches working families.
The ads are part of the Biden for President's ongoing paid media program across television, radio, and digital, with $26 million being spent this week.
