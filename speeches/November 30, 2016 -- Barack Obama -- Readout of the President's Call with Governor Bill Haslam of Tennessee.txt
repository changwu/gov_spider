    The President spoke today by phone with Governor Bill Haslam of Tennessee to express concern and offer his support for the residents of Tennessee who are gravely affected by the devastating Chimney Top Fire. The President expressed his deepest condolences for the lives lost in the fire as well as his sympathies for the affected residents who may have lost their homes or businesses. The President asked the Governor for an update on the ongoing response, and committed to providing the assistance necessary to combat this fire. Earlier this week, FEMA approved a fire management assistance grant to the state of Tennessee to help mobilize the resources necessary for an effective response. The President also expressed concern about the recent tornadoes that have hit the southeastern portion of Tennessee.
