    One, we want change; everybody knows we need it. We want more accessibility; everyone knows we need that. Two, we want to retain the quality of health care that has singled out the United States. And under our plan I believe we not only retain the quality, but we will be able to provide the access. And you're right, market -- let that work on this. And let's not turn to a socialized medicine scheme that sounds good and that's going to cost the taxpayers an arm and a leg. So, we'll keep on it.
But I want to just find out in a little more detail what more we should be doing here because we are very grateful to HEAL for this support. And when you see a coalition of this magnitude working for this common end, it gives me great confidence we can get something done. That's the main thing: Help those people that need help, and do it in a sensible and sound way.
So, we'll see how we go.
