    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocols for the Further Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention and of the Food Aid Convention, which together constitute the International Wheat Agreement, 1971. These Protocols were formulated by a Conference of Governments which met in London on February 14, 1975, and were open for signature in Washington from March 25 through April 14.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocols.
The Protocol for the Further Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, extends the Convention until June 30, 1976, and maintains the framework for international cooperation in wheat trade matters. It also continues the existence of the International Wheat Council.
The Protocol for the Further Extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1971, also extends until June 30, 1976, commitments of parties to provide minimum annual quantities of food aid to developing countries. It is the intention of the United States not to deposit ratification of this Protocol unless the European Economic Community becomes a party to the Protocol. The United States formally recorded this intention by written declaration when the Protocol was signed.
Both Protocols provide that instruments of ratification shall be deposited no later than June 18, 1975. The Wheat Council may, however, grant an extension of time to any signatory government that has not deposited an instrument of ratification by that date.
It is my hope that the Senate will give early and favorable consideration to the two Protocols so that ratification by the United States can be effected and instruments of ratification can be deposited without undue delay.
