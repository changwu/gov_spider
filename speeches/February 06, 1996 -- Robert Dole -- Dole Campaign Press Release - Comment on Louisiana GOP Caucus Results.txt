    Phil Gramm's presidential campaign was boiled and peeled like a Louisiana crawfish tonight. After proclaiming this was a "must win" contest for him, Senator Gramm suffered a devastating blow. Gramm's defeat in Louisiana only reinforces Bob Dole's strength as the most powerful Republican challenger to Bill Clinton.
Phil Gramm isn't the only loser tonight. Farmers in Iowa and across the country are losers because Phil Gramm abandoned them on the farm bill today to campaign for himself in Louisiana. It was a terrible mistake for Senator Gramm to spurn Iowa's First-in-the-Nation tradition in the first place, but now Senator Gramm has added insult to injury -- and lost the gain he schemed for in Louisiana. Senator Gramm will certainly pay a heavy price next Monday for his dereliction of duty in the Senate among Iowans who count on agriculture for their livelihoods.
