    Today, OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein and Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate policy Heather Zichal convened a White House meeting with key stakeholders, including representatives from the American Chemistry Council, the American Gas Association, the American Natural Gas Association, the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers, to discuss the recently issued Executive Order supporting safe and responsible development of unconventional domestic natural gas resources. The new Executive Order establishes a deputy-level interagency working group to coordinate policy and to promote sensible, cost-effective approaches. Today's action is a key part of the administration's ongoing commitment to an "all of the above" energy approach. Coordinated efforts to promote development of unconventional domestic natural gas resources enhance our energy security and create jobs. The participants in the meeting represented all components of the value chain – from the exploration and production companies to the manufacturers and other end users. The conversation focused on promoting cross-agency coordination and cost-effective approaches as well as additional opportunities for working together to take full advantage of our natural gas resources – all while also providing communities the confidence that environmental protection and public health will not be compromised.
