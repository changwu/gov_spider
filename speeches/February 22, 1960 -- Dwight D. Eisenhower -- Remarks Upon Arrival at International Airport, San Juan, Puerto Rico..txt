    Governor Munoz Marin:
Thank you very much indeed for your words of welcome.
Naturally, I am delighted that my first stop on this 15,000-mile journey is in Puerto Rico. To all of you, I bring greetings from your fellow citizens of the 50 States of the Republic. I bring their best wishes for your continued success in making this island a unique demonstration of how free men and women work together for their mutual good. For Puerto Rico is truly unique. We are happy that Puerto Rico is a proud, free, self-governing Commonwealth, joined to the United States of America by her own choice.
This island, in the Caribbean waters between two great continental land masses, has been stirred by two mighty currents of history, enriched by two great treasuries of culture.
Out of them, Puerto Rico has fashioned its own way of life, blending the best of the old and the new.
Your program of development--rooted in self-confidence, self-help, and self-achievement--has aroused tremendous interest in every area of the free world. To other peoples now struggling to realize their aspirations and ambitions, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has demonstrated that courage, persistence, faith in one's fellow men and a Godgiven destiny can open up ways through barriers and obstacles that might appear to be insurmountable.
By what you have accomplished for yourselves, by the help you have given others toward a like accomplishment for themselves, you have made for the Commonwealth a record of achievement in which many other people around the globe have found hope and inspiration.
Although the hours I spend here must be few, I know that I shall leave tomorrow morning sharing some of the hope and some of the inspiration that are inescapable on this island.
Thank you very much.
