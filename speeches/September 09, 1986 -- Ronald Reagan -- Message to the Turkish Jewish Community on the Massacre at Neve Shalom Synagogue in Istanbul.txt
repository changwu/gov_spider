    The senseless killing of twenty-two members of the congregation at the Neve Shalom Synagogue on September 6 has shocked all Americans. You have our deepest sympathy in this hour of grief.
These vicious murders were an attack on the values and standards of civilized men everywhere, and we are resolute in our determination to put an end to such horrors. In your sorrow and suffering, I hope it will be of some comfort to know that the people of the United States stand with you.
Sincerely,
/ S / RONALD REAGAN
