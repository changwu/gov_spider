    President Trump. Thank you very much. It's great to have Prime Minister May from the United Kingdom and her representatives, who are people we know very well through recent trade negotiations. I have to say, we'll be doing a lot of trading with the United Kingdom, and we look forward to it. And we have gotten to know each other over the last period of a year, and it's a real honor to have you here.
Thank you very much, Theresa.
Prime Minister May. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Trump. Thank you.
Prime Minister May. It's good to be here. And as you say, we've had many discussions between our representatives and ourselves on a whole variety of issues, including trade, which will be important for us, but some other issues: foreign policy issues, our security and defense relationship, which of course is the closestâ€”the U.K. and the U.S. is the closest we have. And it's great that that continues.
President Trump. Well, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, Theresa.
Prime Minister May. Thank you.
