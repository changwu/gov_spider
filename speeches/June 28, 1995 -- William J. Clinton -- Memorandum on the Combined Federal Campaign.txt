    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
I am delighted that Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala has agreed to serve as the chair of the 1995 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support the campaign by personally chairing it in your Agency and appointing a top official as your vice chair.
The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal employees to support thousands of worthy charities. This year our goal again is to raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only contribute to the campaign, but assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another successful campaign this year.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
