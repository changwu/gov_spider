    Sestak to Campaign for Klobuchar in New Hampshire
MANCHESTER, NH â€” Former Presidential candidate and Congressman, Admiral Joe Sestak today endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. He cited Klobuchar's experience, ability to unite the country, and understanding of global leadership as the reasons why she is best qualified to serve as Commander in Chief.
"We need a nominee with a depth and breadth of experience to govern effectively, a proven track record of winning in red and blue districts and states so we can unite this country again, and an understanding of the need to rebuild our global leadership so we can convene the world to tackle the defining challenges of our time. It's why I ran for President last year - and having seen her on the campaign trail and observed her work in the Senate, it's why I know Amy Klobuchar is uniquely qualified to be President. I'm proud to endorse her," said Admiral and former Congressman and Presidential candidate Joe Sestak.
Sestak will campaign for Senator Klobuchar in New Hampshire throughout the weekend, where he'll host events at veteran's organizations throughout the Granite State. His endorsement comes as a recent poll found Senator Amy Klobuchar surging in New Hampshire with just days until the primary. In the new Monmouth poll, Klobuchar has jumped seven points since September to 9%. According to the poll, "In a race restricted to the top five polling candidates, the race tightens to 17% Biden, 13% Warren, and 13% Klobuchar."
