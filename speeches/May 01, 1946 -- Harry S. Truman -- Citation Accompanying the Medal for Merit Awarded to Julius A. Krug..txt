TO
JULIUS A. KRUG
JULIUS A. KRUG, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services as a member and as Chairman of the War Production Board from June 1941 to September 1945. Mr. Krug discharged with extraordinary skill and astute judgment an assignment involving the over-all direction of the war Production effort. With sustained effort and outstanding initiative, he assured the effective utilization of the productive energies of the nation. His achievements in determining and establishing successful controls over the flow of critical materials between various military and civilian agencies resulted in a constant and adequate supply of weapons and equipment to our fighting forces, and at the same time maintained the strength and vitality of our civilian economy to the extent that its ability to support the war program was never in jeopardy. Mr. Krug's exceptional administrative ability and effective coordination of all agencies engaged in war production constitute one of the most significant personal contributions to the successful prosecution of the War.
