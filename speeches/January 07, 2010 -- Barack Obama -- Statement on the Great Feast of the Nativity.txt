    To those of the Orthodox Christian faith who are celebrating the Great Feast of the Nativity today, Michelle and I wanted to extend our warmest wishes to you and your family. The holiday season is a time to reflect upon and cherish what's most important in life: our most deeply held values, the love of friends and family, and the bond of community and country. May this continue to be a time of fellowship and generosity to our fellow citizens.
