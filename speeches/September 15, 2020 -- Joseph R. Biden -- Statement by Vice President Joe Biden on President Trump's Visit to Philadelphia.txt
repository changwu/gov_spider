    After four years of failed leadership and broken promises from President Trump, Philadelphians see this president for what he is. President Trump failed Pennsylvania when he promised to bring back jobs but only brought a tax scam that favored the super wealthy and CEOs. He failed Pennsylvania when he intentionally misled the American people and refused to act to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now claimed the lives of nearly 8,000 Pennsylvanians. And he failed Pennsylvania by allowing the pandemic to devastate the economic wellbeing of millions and drive the state's unemployment rate to reach its highest level in decades.
Long before COVID-19 spread to Philadelphia, President Trump's failed leadership was felt in every corner of the city. Pennsylvanians deserve better. As President, I will restore the leadership that has been lacking in the White House for the past four years, and help working families recover from this crisis and build back better than they were before. That means supporting the small businesses that fuel our economy, advancing racial equity across our economic system, and creating millions of good-paying jobs.
