    Senator Sheila Kuehl to Serve as Chair of California LGBT Steering Committee
The California Hillary Clinton for President Campaign today announced the formation of its statewide Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Steering Committee for Hillary which consists of more than 100 LGBT leaders and allies. The Campaign also announced that California State Senator Sheila James Kuehl would serve as Chair of the Committee.
"I am honored to have the support of these distinguished leaders in the LGBT community," Clinton said. "Together, we can end the divisive politics of the current administration and renew the promise of fairness and equality for all Americans."
The list of supporters reflects the diversity of the LGBT community and its allies, and includes California State Senators Sheila Kuehl and Christine Kehoe; West Hollywood Councilmembers Abbe Land and John Heilman; San Diego Councilmember Toni Atkins; and Palm Springs Mayor-Elect Steve Pougnet and Councilmember-Elect Rick Hutcheson.
"Hillary Clinton has demonstrated both the experience and the leadership to make a difference for the LGBT community," said Senator Kuehl. "As our next President, Hillary will fairly represent all Americans and all communities."
Hillary has been a longtime ally of the LGBT community. She fought against the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) both times and has worked on legislation that would promote equality for LGBT Americans.
As President, Hillary will work to make sure that gay and lesbian couples in committed relationships have the same legal rights and responsibilities as all Americans. She will also work to end discrimination in adoption laws, sign hate crimes legislation and ENDA into law, and put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
