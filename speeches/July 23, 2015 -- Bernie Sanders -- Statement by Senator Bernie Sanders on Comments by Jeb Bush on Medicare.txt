    WASHINGTON â€“ Responding to Jeb Bush's assertion that "we need to figure out a way to phase out" Medicare, Sen. Bernie Sanders today issued the following statement:
"It is an indication of how far right-wing the Republican Party has become when its 'moderate' candidate, Jeb Bush, at a forum sponsored by the billionaire Koch brothers, is now talking about phasing out Medicare. This follows Bush's statement that we should raise the retirement age for Social Security.
"As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Medicare, it is important that we defend this enormously important program rather than talk about ending it.
"Medicare provides health care to 51 million American seniors and people with disabilities and has saved the lives of countless Americans.
"Further, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the finances of Medicare have been significantly improved and it is now fully funded for the next 15 years through 2030.
"Our goal as a nation should be to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all Americans, not end a highly-successful program which protects seniors and the disabled."
