    I'm pleased that the Senate took action today to move forward on the nominees who have waited far too long for a vote. Over the last 2 years, I've nominated leaders to fill important positions required to do the work of the American people, only to have those positions remain unfilled, not because the nominees were somehow unqualified, but for purely political reasons. I want to thank the Senators from both parties—including Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, and Senator McCain—who have worked together to find a path forward and give these nominees the votes they deserve. In the weeks ahead, I hope the Congress will build on this spirit of cooperation to advance other urgent middle class priorities, including the need to take action to pass commonsense immigration reform and keep interest rates on student loans low for families trying to afford a higher education.
