    CHARLESTON, S.C. â€“ Presidential candidate Nikki Haley released the following statement on the allegations against President Biden and his family's financial ties to China and Romania:
"If true, the allegations about the Biden family's financial ties to China and other countries raise serious questions about corruption and why the Department of Justice never acted on this information. Joe Biden must be transparent with the American people about what he knew, when he knew it, and every penny his family received from foreign countries."
