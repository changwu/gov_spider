    Mr. Secretary-General, this is my eighth chance to welcome you to New York, and I'm honored to do so. You did mention, I'm heading into retirement—[laughter]—but it has been a joy to work with you, the staff, and many of the leaders here in this hall.
It is my honor to propose a toast, Mr. Secretary-General, to you and to your hard work. May God bless all in the room, and, Mr. Secretary-General, may God continue to bless you, sir.
