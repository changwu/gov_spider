    Montana Governor Steve Bullock is the only candidate to have actually won and governed a Trump state.
In 2016, Donald Trump won Montana by 20 points. In the same election, Governor Bullock was re-elected by 4 points. He's worked with majority Republican legislatures to get progressive things done — like expanding Medicaid to 100,000 people, making record investments in public education, and passing some of the most progressive dark money laws in the country. 
Governor Bullock is a progressive who has proven that he can win the places Democrats have lost and make government work again.
Governor Bullock's Progressive Accomplishments in a Trump State:

Passed Medicaid expansion through a nearly two-thirds Republican legislature, bringing health coverage to nearly 100,000 Montanans.
Made record investments in public education and froze college tuition for 6 out of 8 years in office, helping Montana to have the fourth lowest in-state tuition and fees in the nation.
Signed an executive order requiring every business that bids on public contracts to disclose their political spending.
Passed one of the most progressive campaign finance disclosure laws in the country, setting a national standard for clean and fair elections.
Stopped every attack on a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions.

Opposed or vetoed every attempt to make Montana a right-to-work state.
