    Nevada's Democratic Representative Declares Hillary "100% on the side of Nevada."
The Clinton campaign announced today the endorsement of Congressional Representative Shelley Berkley. Berkley will lend her experience, knowledge, and influence to Senator Clinton's historic run for the White House.
"When I first met Hillary years ago I was struck by the depth of her caring and knowledge of the concerns of my fellow Nevadans. And I have always been impressed that she is ready, able, and willing to take action. Her record against Yucca Mountain is 100% on the side of Nevada. I know first hand her tenacious advocacy for family health care, veteran's services, education, and affordable housing - and have no doubt Hillary Clinton has the strength, knowledge, courage, and vision to be a President who will lead by action to solve our great challenges at home and abroad."
Representing Nevada's first Congressional district, Rep. Shelley Berkley is currently serving her fifth term in Congress, where she serves on the House Committees on Ways and Means and Veterans' Affairs. Uniquely qualified to represent Nevada's First District, Berkley has resided in Las Vegas for over forty years, and is an alumna of the University of Nevada Las Vegas. She has previously served in the Nevada State Assembly and as the Vice Chair of the Nevada University and Community College System Board of Regents.
"Shelley Berkley is all about results - and she has delivered for Nevada time and time again," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "Shelley knows that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate that has a proven record of making real change happen, and shares Hillary's bold vision for America's future. We're thrilled to have the boundless energy and tremendous knowledge of our state's most passionate advocate on Hillary's team, helping us turn out every last caucus-goer."
