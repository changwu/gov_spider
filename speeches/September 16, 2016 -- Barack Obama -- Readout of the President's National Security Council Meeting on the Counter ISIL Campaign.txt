    President Obama today convened his National Security Council to discuss the global campaign we are leading to degrade and destroy ISIL. The President was briefed on multiple advances against ISIL that the Coalition has enabled across the battlefield in both Iraq and Syria, noting that the Iraqis have now reclaimed over 50 percent of the territory once controlled by ISIL, while our partners across northern Syria have essentially closed off ISIL's access to the Syrian border with Turkey and the outside world. The President directed his team to continue close coordination with all of our partners in the Counter ISIL fight as we build on this momentum to plan operations to further pressure ISIL. The President expressed deep concern that, despite decreased violence across the country, the Syrian regime continues to block the flow of critical humanitarian aid. The President emphasized that the United States will not proceed with the next steps in the arrangement with Russia until we see seven continuous days of reduced violence and sustained humanitarian access.
