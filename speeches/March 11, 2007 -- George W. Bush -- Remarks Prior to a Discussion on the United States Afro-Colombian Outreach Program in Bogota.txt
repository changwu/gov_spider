    Well, Mr. President, thank you very much. Laura and I, as well as Secretary of State Rice and our Ambassador, are honored that citizens from your country have come to share with us stories and concerns that will better enable our Government to help. And the reason I say that is because the best foreign policy for the United States is to help people realize their full potential. That can be done through education, jobs.
The President and I had a long discussion this morning about issues that will help create jobs and facilitate the flow of trade, for example, all aiming at helping the people in our respective countries realize God-given potential. And so we come bringing the greetings of the people of the United States. Our Ambassador has briefed me on some of the programs that the taxpayers of my country have helped fund. But we're really interested in hearing your stories. And Colombia is a fine democracy. And the true test of a democracy is for every citizen in that country to be able to feel the full promise of society.
And so we thank you for coming. And, Mr. President, why don't weâ€”we can go around the table, and I'm interested in hearing the different stories about the lives of some of your citizens.
Shall we start? How about you, doctor? Do you want to start?
[At this point, the public portion of the event concluded; the discussion continued, however, and no transcript was provided.]
