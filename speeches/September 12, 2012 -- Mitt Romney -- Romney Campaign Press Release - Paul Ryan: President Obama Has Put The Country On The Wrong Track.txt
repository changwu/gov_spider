Or we can get this right, we can turn it around, we can reclaim our founding principles, reapply them to the problems of the day and get America back on the right track. That's what we're going to do." â€” Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "And it's a very clear choice. We can either stay on the path that we are on, the one that President Obama has placed us upon. That's a country in debt, that's a country in doubt, and yes, that is a country in decline. Or we can get this right, we can turn it around, we can reclaim our founding principles, reapply them to the problems of the day and get America back on the right track. That's what we're going to do. ... Here's the problem: President Obama and too many politicians like him are more worried about their next election than they're worried about the next generation. We're not going to make that mistake. We're not going to kick the can. We're going to lead. Because what we want is we want to earn your support. We want to deserve victory so that we have the moral authority and the obligation to fix this mess in Washington and get this country out of debt and back on track. And we want growth, we want opportunity, we want prosperity. That is what this is all about at the end of the day."
