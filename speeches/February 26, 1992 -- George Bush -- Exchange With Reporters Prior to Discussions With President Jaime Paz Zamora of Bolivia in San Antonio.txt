    Q. Mr. President, what do you say to Members of Congress who say your drug war has been a failure?
The President. I tell them they don't know what they're talking about. That's what I say. The record is good.
[At this point, one group of journalists left the room, and a second group entered.]
The President. I might say with your countrymen here that we are very respectful of the job you're doing and cooperation, not only in the antinarcotics field but in so many other areas. I'm just delighted to see you again.
Q. Mr. Bush, is the Government of the United States going to support the private industry helping other programs in Bolivia?
The President. Well, we think we need every facet of our society helping, the Government, private, everybody getting involved to help as best we can. And it's a two-way street. I think Bolivia has been very cooperative with the United States. We've got a couple of sticking points here that we'll talk about. But I think generally speaking it's going quite well, and we salute the President for his efforts. He is a dedicated leader who is trying to whip a tough problem. And we know that, and we respect that. So he's welcome here, and we're glad to have the whole team with us.
Thank you all very much.
