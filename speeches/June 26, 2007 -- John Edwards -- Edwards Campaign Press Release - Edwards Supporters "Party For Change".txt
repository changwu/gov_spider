    Supporters to hold house parties across the country on Wednesday, June 27th, 2007
Chapel Hill, North Carolina – On Wednesday, June 27th, 2007, John Edwards supporters will gather at house parties in all 50 states to "Party for Change." As the end of the second fundraising quarter approaches, supporters will hold nearly 400 house parties to raise money and support for Edwards and his campaign to transform America.
"Our campaign is gaining momentum across the country thanks to the hard work of committed grassroots supporters," said National Campaign Manager David Bonior. "These house parties are a great chance for people to learn more about John Edwards and to help the campaign spread his vision of One America, where everyone who works hard has the opportunity to get ahead."
In March, around 2,400 people attended house parties before the end of the first fundraising quarter. Tomorrow, an estimated 4,000 people are expected to attend parties in all 50 states, including multiple parties in each of the four early primary and caucus states.
At the house parties, party hosts will show a special DVD of Edwards and his wife Elizabeth talking about Edwards' bold, detailed plans to address the challenges facing our nation. Party attendees can then join a conference call with Edwards to hear about his vision to build One America.
The Edwards campaign has continued to build support at the grassroots level through its John Edwards One Corps organization. The campaign is focused on reaching out to all Americans—not just those who can give the maximum donation to the campaign, so it has organized grassroots fundraisers around the country for thousands more supporters who share Edwards' commitment to changing our country. In addition to the house parties, this week the campaign is continuing its series of "Small Change for Big Change" grassroots fundraisers around the country.
