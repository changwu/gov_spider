Sebastian Gorka a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House has just written an excellent book 'Why We Fight.' Much will be learned from this very good read!Retweets: 16902Favorites: 78717

General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing. Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the U.S. including BMW which just announced a major new plant. The U.S.A. is booming!Retweets: 18834Favorites: 83713

Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren't even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. A total disgrace!Retweets: 26413Favorites: 99632

When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40000000 (is that possible?) it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!Retweets: 23745Favorites: 88691

Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way to go. If companies don't want to pay Tariffs build in the U.S.A. Otherwise lets just make our Country richer than ever before!Retweets: 21663Favorites: 94046

Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting....Retweets: 19346Favorites: 82126

.@SteveScalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (BACK IN THE GAME) on the world of D.C. politics and more. He has experienced so much in a short period of time. Few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back. A big power and great person!Retweets: 12618Favorites: 53689

As RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel oversaw history defying gains in the Senate and unprecedented fundraising strength. I have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect because there is no one better for the job!Retweets: 15071Favorites: 70007
