    Yesterday I called on Congress to act quickly to strengthen and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. More than 900,000 women across the country suffer violence at the hands of an intimate partner each year, demonstrating the continuing need for this legislation. I am very pleased that today the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This vote affirms our commitment to support the work of State and local prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, and health care and social service professionals throughout the country who every day respond to women who are victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault.
It is now time for the Senate to act. Unless the act is reauthorized by September 30, authorization for critical grant programs supporting the victims of domestic violence will be in jeopardy. With over 70 sponsors in the Senate, there is no reason for delay.
