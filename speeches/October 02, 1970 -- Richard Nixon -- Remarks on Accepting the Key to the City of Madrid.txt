    Mr. Mayor, Your Excellencies:
It is a very great honor for Mrs. Nixon and me to receive the key to the city of Madrid.
This is not an ordinary key. An ordinary key can open the door of a house or of a room. But this key, as we have already seen in the part of the road that we have traveled, opens the hearts of the people of Madrid and the people of Spain to the people of the United States.
We are grateful for this wonderful welcome.
We have many pleasant memories of our visit here before and we look forward to our stay in this, one of the greatest cities in the world.
Thank you.
