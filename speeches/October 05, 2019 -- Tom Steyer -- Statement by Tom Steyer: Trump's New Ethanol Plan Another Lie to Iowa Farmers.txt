    (Des Moines, IA, October 5, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement on Donald Trump's latest ethanol plan.
"Donald Trump has spent the last three years putting fossil fuel corporations ahead of Iowa farmers and this last ditch plan is nothing more than empty promises," said Steyer. "The truth is that Trump has given out 85 waivers to oil refineries, causing 30 ethanol plants to close or temporarily stop production. And just last week, John Deere laid off 160 Iowa workers because of Trump's ignorance of how the global economy really works. It's time to call out the president for who he is: a fraud and a failure.
"Iowans deserve real economic leadership, not lies. As president, I will work tirelessly with farmers and their families to build an economy that works for them."
