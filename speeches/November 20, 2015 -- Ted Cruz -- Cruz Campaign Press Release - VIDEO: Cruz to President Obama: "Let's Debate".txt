HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today, the Cruz for President campaign released a video highlighting Presidential candidate Ted Cruz's challenge to President Obama for a debate on the Administration's proposed plan to admit tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees, who FBI Director James Comey acknowledged cannot be properly vetted, to the United States.
The challenge comes in response to President Obama referring to Cruz and millions of Americans who oppose the Administration's plan as "offensive" and "un-American."


In the video, Cruz responds:
"Mr. President. If you want to insult me, you can do it overseas, you can do it in Turkey, you can do it in foreign countries, but I would encourage you, Mr. President, come back and insult me to my face.
"Let's have a debate on Syrian refugees right now, we can do it anywhere you want."
