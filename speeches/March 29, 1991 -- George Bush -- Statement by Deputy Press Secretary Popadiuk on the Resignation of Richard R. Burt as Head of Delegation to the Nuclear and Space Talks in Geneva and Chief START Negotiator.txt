    President Bush has accepted the resignation of Ambassador Richard R. Burt as Head of Delegation to the Nuclear and Space Talks in Geneva and Chief START Negotiator. After 10 years in government, serving in both the Reagan and Bush administrations, Ambassador Burt is moving into the private sector.
In addition to his current post, Ambassador Burt, during his tenure in government, served in several other important positions, including as Director of the Politico-Military Affairs Bureau in the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, and Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany. In all of these positions, he served the United States with great distinction.
The President appreciates Ambassador Burt's dedicated service and is pleased that he has agreed to serve as a consultant to the Secretary of State.
Following Ambassador Burt's departure from government, Ambassador Linton F. Brooks, who has served as Ambassador Burt's deputy since 1989, will become the Acting Head of Delegation to the Nuclear and Space Talks.
