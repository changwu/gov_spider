    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Section 503 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1978, I am pleased to submit to the Congress a report on recommendations for reform of the United Nations. Also enclosed is a detailed analysis of various reform proposals provided to me by the Secretary of State.
I assumed the Presidency with a commitment to strengthen this essential instrument of world peace and U.S. diplomacy. I now reaffirm that the United States will make the fullest possible use of the United Nations to assist in solving the many political, economic, legal, and humanitarian problems that press upon the international community.
At the same time, I am aware of the need to maintain constant attention to reform of the UN. This report contains a number of positive proposals for reform that this Administration intends to pursue.
I welcome this opportunity to communicate with you on these issues, and I appreciate the Congress permitting a one month delay in submission of this report. I value highly the work of the Congress in support of U.S. participation in the United Nations, and look forward to a continuation of that cooperative endeavor.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
