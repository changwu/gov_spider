    Background: On his first day in office, President Obama signed the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, calling for unprecedented transparency, participation, and collaboration as a hallmark of his Administration. Similarly, in 2005, India enacted the Right to Information Act, adopting a national commitment to openness as a means to make government more effective and accountable. Both nations believe that democratizing access to information and energizing civic engagement through the use of new technologies are critical to delivering better services, especially to those at the bottom of the pyramid; fostering greater entrepreneurship and economic opportunity; and holding government officials accountable.
The Event: The Expo for Democracy and Open Government will highlight key Indian innovations that strengthen democracy, focusing on the intersection of technology, citizen empowerment, and accountability, and allow participants to interact with civil society innovators/exhibitors to gain a sense of the power of these new technologies and approaches.
The event builds on the vision of open societies and open governments that the President laid out in his address to the U.N. General Assembly this past September.
It will highlight a selection of India's extraordinary groups working on a set of interlinking themes:
Transparency. Groups that use the right to information and e-governance to place government information in the public domain and push for accountability.
Participation. Groups that promote direct citizen participation in local government, particularly panchayats and municipalities; bring "people's voices" into budget making and policy processes; and strengthen people's participation in planning and monitoring government programs.
Government Responsiveness. Efforts by the government to improve the delivery of services, including through the wiring of rural villages for government services (e-panchayat), initiatives by groups to monitor day-to-day government functions.
Political Accountability. Groups that promote accountability in legislative functions and processes and groups working to monitor elections, promote electoral reforms, and strengthen electoral processes.
The event will also mark the launch of the United States-India Open Government Dialogue, to be led by Innovation Advisor to the Prime Minister Sam Pitroda and United States Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra.
