    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Richardson (D) New Hampshire and 3 others)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2266 unless it is amended to:
— reduce the 1986 appropriation authorization for Amtrak from $616 million to levels at or below those in the Congressional Budget Resolution ($582 million as a first step toward acceptable funding reductions for Amtrak;
— delete the (1) requirement that Amtrak use non-operational capital project funds in order to maintain its. current levels of rail service and (2) prohibition on Amtrak reducing the frequency of service on any line, which as of May 1, 1985, had 3 or fewer trains operating in either direction per week. These restrictions would hamper Amtrak's efforts to improve operational efficiency and seriously undermine efforts to reduce and eliminate Amtrak's dependence on Federal subsidies; and
— delete the provision establishing a 15-member Commission to study (1) ways of improving Amtrak's financial performance and (2) funding alternatives. The establishment of a Commission is unnecessary and would needlessly duplicate assessments of Amtrak's financial performance that have already been made, as well as delay action to obtain funding alternatives for Amtrak.
