    Today, former Washington Governor Chris Gregoire joined elected officials and community leaders in endorsing Joe Biden for President.
"Joe Biden will unite and heal our country. He is a leader who has dedicated his life to fighting for working families and I know on day one he'll get our country back on track," said Governor Chris Gregoire.
