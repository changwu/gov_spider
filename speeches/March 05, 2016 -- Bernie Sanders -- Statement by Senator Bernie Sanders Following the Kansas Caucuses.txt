    
WARREN, Mich. â€“ Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Saturday after the Kansas Democratic Party announced he won the state's caucuses, which saw a larger turnout this year than in 2008:
"I thank the people of Kansas for their strong support.
"People used to ask, 'What's the matter with Kansas?' It turns out that there's nothing the matter with Kansas when you give people a clear choice and involve them in the democratic process. 
"We have now won double-digit victories from New England to the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains to the Midwest. Democrats in Kansas today added to a column of double-digit victories in Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Hampshire and Vermont. We also came from behind and ended up in virtual ties in Iowa and Massachusetts. We have the momentum. We have a path toward victory. Our campaign is just getting started and we are going all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
