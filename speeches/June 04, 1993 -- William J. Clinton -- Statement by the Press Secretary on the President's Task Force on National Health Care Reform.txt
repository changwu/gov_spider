    On January 25, 1993, the President announced the creation of a Task Force on National Health Care Reform. The President asked the task force to provide him with proposals for comprehensive health care reform. The President also announced on January 25 the creation of an interdepartmental working group that would gather and analyze information and options for the task force.
In over 20 meetings held during April and May, the task force reviewed materials it received from the interdepartmental working group, formulated proposals and options for health care reform, and presented those proposals and options to the President. Each of those task force meetings was noticed in the Federal Register.
Having completed its mission, the task force terminated on May 30, as provided in its charter.
The President is now in the process of reviewing the proposals he has received from the task force and choosing from among the policy options that have been presented to him.
