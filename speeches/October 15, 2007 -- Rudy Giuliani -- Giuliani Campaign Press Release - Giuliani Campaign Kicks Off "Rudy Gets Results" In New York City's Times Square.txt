    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today kicked off "Rudy Gets Results" at a press conference in New York City's Times Square. "Rudy Gets Results" will promote the Mayor's successful record leading New York City, while demonstrating the need for his vision as President. Times Square is a well-known example of the City's revitalization during his tenure.
Giuliani's New York City Campaign Chairman and former New York City Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington joined former New York City Deputy Mayors Joe Lhota and Randy Mastro to speak about Giuliani's success in the City. Also attending were Giuliani's New York State Campaign Co-Chairs Guy Molinari and Bill Powers, several other former Deputy Mayors, current and former local elected officials and former members of Mayor Giuliani's administration.
"Over the course of his two terms as Mayor, Rudy demonstrated real leadership," said Washington. "Whether it was cutting crime or improving the quality of life for citizens, his efforts greatly enhanced the lives of New York City residents in real and measurable ways."
"Mayor Giuliani also proved that fiscally conservative policies of cutting taxes, ending wasteful government spending and stimulating private sector job growth are achievable, even when facing overwhelming obstacles," said Lhota. "As President, he will bring that same fiscal conservative leadership to Washington."
Mastro added, "Rudy offers the American people a commitment to strong, disciplined management, the same governing philosophy that helped revitalize New York City."
In the coming weeks, Giuliani's former Deputy Mayors will join supporters around the country to discuss the Mayor's record of results and how Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People will help guide his Presidency.
