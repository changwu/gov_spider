    Secretary Clinton's first stop on her socialized medicine tour is in Louisiana, where Governor Bobby Jindal has rejected the expansion of ObamaCare in the state because it would put more people on a poorly-run government healthcare system, take away freedom from people, and bust the budget.
"I have a plan that repeals Obamacare and replaces it with something that preserves freedom, empowers patients, lowers costs and reduces the role of both federal government and insurance company bureaucrats. Instead of battling through press releases though, I have an idea for Hillary Clinton, let's have a debate about healthcare. Instead of the carefully controlled campaign events that Secretary Clinton prefers, let's give the American people a real live discussion." -Bobby Jindal
