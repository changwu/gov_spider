    President Donald J. Trump applauds Congress for taking steps to strengthen our Nation's immigration laws with H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. This bill provides law enforcement with the tools they need to improve domestic security and restore public safety by denying criminal alien gang members admission to the United States. President Trump has always made the safety of Americans his highest priority, and encourages the Senate to take quick action and pass this bill.
