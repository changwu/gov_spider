    Today, President Biden released his FY23 Budget, which reflects three important values: fiscal responsibility, safety and security at home and abroad, and a commitment to building a better America.
The Budget shows how the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years, powered by the American Rescue Plan, has put the deficit on track to drop by more than $1.3 trillion this year—the largest-ever one-year decline.
Through a new Billionaire Minimum Income Tax and other measures, budget policies will build on this progress and reduce deficits by a total of over $1 trillion over the next decade. The Budget helps keep our communities safe by putting more cops on the beat for community policing, fighting gun crime, and investing in crime prevention and community violence interventions. It makes one of the largest investments in our national security in U.S. history, strengthening our military and leveraging our renewed strength at home to meet pressing global challenges. And it makes other critical investments to help build a better America—cutting costs for families and advancing the bipartisan Unity Agenda the President laid out in his State of the Union address.
