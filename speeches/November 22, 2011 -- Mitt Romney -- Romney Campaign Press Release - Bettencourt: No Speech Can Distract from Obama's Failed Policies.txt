    New Hampshire House Majority Leader and Romney supporter D.J. Bettencourt made the following statement on President Obama's visit to New Hampshire:
"President Obama today brings his failed policies to the Granite State. No speech or spin can distract New Hampshire voters from the fact that on every economic test, President Obama has been a failure. We can't afford four more years of economic amateurism. Unlike our current president, Mitt Romney knows how the economy actually works and will put in place policies to get our economy moving on day one as president."
