    
(SAN FRANCISCO, October 15, 2019) â€” Morning Consult released their weekly poll yesterday showing Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer polling at 8% in the early primary states.
"Tom's support is accelerating because his message is resonating with voters in the critical early states," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "It is thanks to their support that Tom will be taking the national stage tonight to share how he has been working to lessen the effects of climate change, how he has organized the largest youth voter mobilization effort in history to help take back the House in 2018, and led a national movement to impeach Donald Trump. He will be the only candidate on stage proposing big structural reforms like term limits and national referendums, and he's the Democrat best prepared to expose Donald Trump as a fraud and a failure."
After tonight's debate, Steyer will make visits to South Carolina and Iowa.
