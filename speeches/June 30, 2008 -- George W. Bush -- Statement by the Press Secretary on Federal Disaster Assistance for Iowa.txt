    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Iowa impacted by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding beginning on May 25, 2008, and continuing, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program.
The President's major disaster declaration issued for the State on May 27, 2008, initially authorized Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation, and any other forms of assistance under the Stafford Act, subject to the completion of joint Federal, State, and local Preliminary Damage Assessments. Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance under Section 408 were authorized at 75 percent Federal funding of total eligible costs.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program. This adjustment is effective until the respective date at which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service River Forecast Center reports that the rivers in the State of Iowa, which have experienced historical flooding, fall below flood stage.
The increase to 90 percent Federal share is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa.
