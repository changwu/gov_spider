    All Americans were appalled by evidence of the truly deplorable human rights violations which occurred during the Amin regime. While my administration publicly condemned this situation, I would particularly like to commend Senators Hatfield and Weicker and Congressmen Pease and Bonker for the intense concern which they exhibited about the human rights situation in Uganda. The breaking of the pattern of gross violations of human rights heralds a brighter day for Ugandans and, indeed, for all in the world concerned with human rights.
