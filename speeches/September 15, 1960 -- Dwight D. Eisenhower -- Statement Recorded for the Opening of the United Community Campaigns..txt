    IT IS a privilege to serve as an "advance herald" for the united community campaigns. from now until Thanksgiving, these charitable campaigns will be conducted in cities and towns across the country.
In your home town the campaign may be known either as the United fund or Community Chest. In both, many health and welfare agencies join together to ask our help once a year, in one campaign.
Much depends on the results of these nationwide efforts. They supply the funds for many of our local welfare groups and for some great national organizations like the American Red Cross and the USO. Money given in these campaigns also goes to the support of health agencies and medical research.
America has a proud reputation in the field of charity. It is true that we have more of the world's goods than many other nations. But it is also true that we share them generously, with the world and with each other. We do this primarily, I believe, because our spiritual heritage includes a deep sense of responsibility for our fellow men. The united community campaigns testify to the vitality of this heritage.
