    Rep. Connie Mack today made the following statement on Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's favorable comments about President Obama:
"President Obama recently downplayed the threat to the United States posed by Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, saying that his 'overall sense is that what Mr. Chavez has done over the past several years has not had a serious national security impact on us.' The Venezuelan dictator has now returned the favor, expressing his preference for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in the U.S. presidential election campaign.Â  In an interview, Chavez heaped abuse on Romney while explaining that President Obama is 'deep down a good guy.' There is little surprising here. Chavez knows that in Mitt Romney he will face an American president who will not tolerate his antics or his aggression. And he knows that in Barack Obama, he faces an American president who has not blocked his path in any way."
