    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the attacks against Israeli diplomats:
"Today's acts of terrorism against Israeli diplomats underscore the perilous nature of the world we live in. And they underscore the need to stand by our allies in the fight against jihadism. The war against Israel is a war against all democracies, including our own. We can't afford to let down our guard. And we can't afford to waver in our support for our closest ally in the Middle East."
