HOUSTON, Texas — In the 100 hours since the first debate, the Ted Cruz campaign has seen an extraordinary outpouring of financial support. In those few days the campaign:

Raised $1,092,157
Received over 10,000 contributions
Online contributions averaged $54.77

All of this coincides with NBC releasing a poll this weekend showing a national outpouring of support with Cruz surging to second place overall with 13 percent nationwide.
As the Washington Post reported, "The most Googled candidate in the debate at any point was Ted Cruz — with 67 percent more searches at his peak than the next most-searched candidate's peak."
Also over the past 100 hours, Cruz has been engaged in a bus tour across the so-called "SEC primary" states. From South Carolina to Georgia to Alabama to Tennessee (and on to Mississippi and Arkansas and Oklahoma), every event has been standing room only – with hundreds or thousands coming out to support he campaign. RSVPs for each event surged over 50% in the hours following the debate.
The wave of grassroots support is growing. The outpouring of financial support shows that Americans are ready for someone who will tell the truth and has consistently done what they said they'd do. They are ready for a consistent conservative who has fought to break the Washington Cartel and will fight to make America great again.
