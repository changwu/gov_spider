    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
This has been a special year for all Americans. We have experienced a coming together, a rebirth of patriotism and service to the Nation. Whether speaking of Desert Storm or the Thousand Points of Light, I am reminded daily that Federal employees have been in the forefront making magnificent contributions. In this regard, the Combined Federal Campaign is an avenue through which thousands of Federal employees voluntarily express their concern for others. It is also very gratifying and rewarding for those of us in top-level positions to be a part of this important and purposeful endeavor by taking on leadership roles in the Combined Federal Campaign.
I am delighted to tell you that Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin and Martin L. Allday, Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, have agreed to serve as co-chairs of the 1991 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I am asking that you support Secretary Martin and Chairman Allday by personally serving as chairman of the campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your vice chairman.
Your commitment and visible support will help to guarantee a successful campaign this year. Together, we must do everything we can to encourage Federal employees everywhere to do their part in support of the 1991 Combined Federal Campaign.
George Bush
