Travel Pool Report No. 8 - tour details
Passing along:
Pool is holding on the floor of the car show waiting for POTUS.
On background from a White House official â€“
Today, President Biden will tour the Detroit Auto Show, the largest auto show in North America. Throughout the day, he will meet with union workers, CEOs, and local leaders. He will also stop at the Chevrolet, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis booths to view some of their latest car models on display, including the:
Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe 30th Anniversary Edition, which is being manufactured at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Michigan and features a 2.0L I4 Turbo / PHEV engine.
Jeep Wrangler Willy's 4xe, which is manufactured at the Toledo North Assembly Plant, OH, and features a 2.0L I4 Turbo / PHEV engine.
Chevrolet Corvette Z06, which is starting production this month in Bowling Green, Kentucky. With 670 horsepower, the Corvette Z06 features a powerful naturally-aspirated production V8 engine, hand-built in Bowling Green as well by master builders.
Chevrolet Silverado EV, which starts production next year in Michigan and is estimated to have a range of 400 miles on a full charge. The car features up to 10.2kW of off-board power when paired with the available accessory power bar and up to 10,000 lbs. of maximum trailering.
Ford F150, which the President test drove during a factory visit in Dearborn, MI last year.
Following the tour, the President will deliver remarks on how his economic plan is fueling the electric vehicle manufacturing boom in America and lowering costs for American families. He will also announce that his Administration is approving the first set of electric charging plans for 35 states, including Michigan's plan, ahead of schedule. Together these 35 states will cover 53,000 miles of highway with EV chargers, serving 38 million drivers and 47 million cars every year.
Introducing the President will be Ryan Buchalski, the President of UAW LOCAL 598, where has been a member for 20 years. Buchalski is the representative for members at the Flint Assembly plant, which builds heavy duty pickups for General Motors.
President Biden's Electric Vehicle Manufacturing Boom
Since President Biden took office, electric vehicle sales have tripled in America and companies have announced nearly $85 billion to build America's electric vehicle future. For instance:

Toyota announced an additional $2.5 billion investment in a Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing facility.
Honda and LG Energy Solution announced a $4.4 billion joint venture in the U.S.
ABB is announcing a new EV charging manufacturing facility in Columbia, South Carolina capable of producing up to 10,000 chargers per year.
Lincoln Electric announced a new line of fast EV chargers in Cleveland, Ohio.
Siemens has set a goal of expanding manufacturing to build one million EV chargers over the next four years in the U.S. They're expanding their sites in Grand Prairie, Texas and Pomona, California with a union (IBEW) workforce.
SK Signet announced a $35 million Texas investment to build chargers in the United States for the first time.
Piedmont Lithium announced a $582 million investment to establish a lithium refining manufacturing facility in Tennessee for EV batteries.

Biden-Harris Administration Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investments in Michigan

Electric Buses: The City of Detroit was awarded $6.9 million to double their fleet of electric buses. Funding will be used to purchase four new electric buses and to install charging equipment.
Upgrading Michigan Avenue: The city was awarded $25 million to upgrade nearly two miles of Michigan Avenue connecting Downtown and Corktown Detroit. The investment will improve safety, reduce congestion, and help to revitalize the neighborhood through support for dedicated lanes for buses, transit, and connected autonomous vehicles; safety improvements; and shelter and seating at bus stops along 2 miles connecting Downtown and Corktown.
Great Lakes: The Administration awarded $1 billion to accelerate the cleanup and restoration of the Great Lakes. The investments will address legacy pollution due to fertilizer and wastewater runoff from agriculture and industrial activity.

Travel Pool Report No. 9 - the tour begins
The president entered the showroom floor at 11:36 a.m.
The pool spotted GM's Mark Reuss and Mary Barra awaiting Biden's arrival, along with Craig Glidden - GM's general counsel.
POTUS first greeted Mary Barra and started the tour in the GMC section.
Pool then pre-set in front of a bright orange Corvette.
Biden remarked something to the pool as he laid eyes on the car. We believe he said, this thing's nice, but it was hard to hear.
Barra guided Biden into the driver's seat and he turned on the motor and fired up the engine - which is very loud. One of the GM execs offered Biden his hand to help him out of the sports car.
"He said he's driving it home," Barra said.

Travel Pool Report No. 10 - a Mustang and birthday song
Biden then sidled up next to a bright blue all-electric Silverado. Barra showed the president how much space is in the bed and then they walked along to the driver's seat, with the president getting in. He didn't turn on the engine this time.
The president briefly paused for a photo-op, as pool was pulled out of earshot.
Now we're in the Ford section and the president is looking at an orange electric Mustang with Bill Ford
The president was comparing the specs of the Mustang versus his Corvette - and how long it takes to get up to 60 MPH.
"But who's counting," he said.
As the president walked up toward an electric Ford truck, he turned to the pool.
"Can I ask you all a favor," he asked. He then told us that his wife says that happy birthday must be sung on a person's birthday and asked the pool to sing to a woman named Angela.
"She's turning 21," Biden remarked.
"Thank you, my wife would kill me," he said as the song wrapped up.

Travel Pool Report No. 11 - more tour/2024 quotes from Dingell/Stabenow
Next Biden took a look at a 2022 Electric Ford E-Transit utility van.
And then we headed to Jeep. The president greeted Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis. He first walked up on a pedestal to look at the Grand Cherokee and then a Jeep employee pulled up in a Wrangler. Two more Jeep employees drove by in a electric Grand Cherokee.
The president got into the driver's seat of the Grand Cherokee on display, while the other vehicles went through an obstacle course called "Camp Jeep" around him. He didn't turn the engine on.
"He's thinking about it," Sen. Stabenow told the pool when asked if Biden was going to buy the Corvette. She also talked midterms and Sen. Graham's abortion bill. Let your pooler know if you'd like the Otter.
Pool also talked to Gov. Whitmer and Rep. Dingell.
Whitmer initially brushed off a question about whether Biden should run again in 2024, but Dingell jumped in and said she would support him.
"I'm gonna tell you if he runs, we're all supporting him," Dingell said, adding that those are "questions designed to cause trouble."
"There's no question, if President Biden runs again count me in," Stabenow chimed in when asked *if* he should run again.
Let your pooler know if you'd like that Otter as well.
POTUS is with 60 Minutes so pool has been holding by the Lincoln display.

President Biden started his remarks at 2:15 p.m., after a raucous speech by Ryan Buchalski, who said the president was, "Kicking ass for the working class!"

Travel Pool Report No. 15 - fundraising reception
Pool was brought into the Portside Ballroom of the Huntington Place convention center for a Michigan Democratic Party fundraiser for Gov. Whitmer.
"We know he's a car guy, but he didn't have to be here," she said during her remarks, thanking him for making the trip.
Biden arrived onstage at 3:26 a.m.
He made a joke again about Rep. Dingell being "my boss."
He hit many of the same themes he's mentioned in recent political appearances.
"The right to choose is on the ballot," he said. "Is literally on the ballot."
"This is not your father's Republican Party," Biden said, adding that goes for "Gretchen's opponent" who "wants to take us backwards full of anger and division."
Biden's mic was cutting in and out during his remarks.
He alluded to Trump's many infrastructure weeks, saying he made it a "punchline," unlike Democrats who got the bill passed.
"They embrace political violence," he again said of "extreme" Republicans.
"To this day they defend those who stormed the Capitol on January 6," he said.
"The extreme MAGA Republicans are destroying American democracy," he said.
Pool was pulled at 3:40 p.m. as speech wrapped.
Probably 150-200 people in the crowd.

Fuller, additional quotes from the fundraiser: "The right to choose is on the ballot," he said. "In this state, is literally on the ballot."
"There is an extreme set of Republicans who run the Republican Party today. And that includes Gretchen's opponent from what I've read, who wants to take us backwards full of anger and division."
"On choice, Democrats want to codify Roe v. Wade, Republicans want a national ban on abortion. In fact, Gretchen's opponent supports an extreme ban with no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother."
"Gretchen's opponent calls the infrastructure law fake, while Gretchen knows infrastructure provides jobs while keeping commitments ... Fixing the damn roads, for instance."
