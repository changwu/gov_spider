    THANKSGIVING is a time of summing up in America--a time to count our blessings, a time to express both as one people and as individuals our thanks for those blessings.
All Americans can be grateful for what they have received for the rich bounty of a free nation. But some Americans can also be thankful for the knowledge that they have given--that they have contributed to the sum of this Nation's blessings.
None have contributed more to America than our servicemen. All of us have enjoyed freedom, but you have stood ready to fight for it--you have protected it. And so, in this special time when we give thanks to God, we give thanks to you as well for helping to preserve what God has given us.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend our warmest wishes to each of you on this Thanksgiving Day and throughout the year.
