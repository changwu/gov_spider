    President Bush will welcome Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to the White House for a meeting and working dinner on May 19, 2004. Italy is among America's closest Allies and is courageously playing a leading role in the international effort to strengthen peace and democracy in Iraq. Italy is also a valuable contributor to our common efforts in Afghanistan, and in the fight against terrorism.
The President and Prime Minister will discuss a wide range of issues, including our common efforts to bring security and freedom to the people of Iraq, the promotion of freedom and democracy in the greater Middle East, and the enhancement of our counter-terrorism efforts.
