    To the Congress of the United States:
This 1986 United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Annual Report reviews all the government's 1986 arms control activities as well as ACDA's role in them. This relatively small agency plays a key role in the evolution and implementation of arms control policies that contribute importantly to our Nation's security. I know that you share my enthusiasm for ACDA, which celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 1986.
You will find in the pages of the Report detailed material on the three rounds of Nuclear and Space Talks and on the talks that General Secretary Gorbachev and I had in Reykjavik, October 11-12. Details on progress made at the Conference on Disarmament, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks are also included. Our efforts to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons are discussed and the many details of arms control research are highlighted. This Report, as well as previous ACDA reports, contains a great deal of useful and informative historical material.
I am pleased to forward the Report to the Congress.
