STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS: "Mitt Romney said his first trip as President would be to Israel. The President of the United States' people now say the President's first trip to Israel would be the minute he's re-elected. What's going on there?"
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR: "First of all, I'd say it's about time on the President's behalf. But really, it's about three and a half years too late, just as Brian said earlier. There's just been a real cloud, I think, put out by the White House over the relationship that this President has with Israel. I think very much in contrast to the bipartisan relationship that Capitol Hill holds for the U.S.-Israel relationship. But it's very clear that Mitt Romney is going to Israel, to the U.K., to Poland, to visit allies of ours who stand with us in times of challenge. And frankly, I think that what he'll see over there is—and hear— are governments very wary of the direction of America's leadership. I mean, Steve, I've been there in the region lately and I hear from Arab governments as well as the Israelis, questioning where is America in terms of our leadership?"
