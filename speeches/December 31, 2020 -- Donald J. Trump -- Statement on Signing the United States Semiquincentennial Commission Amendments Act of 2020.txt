    Today, I have signed into law S. 3989, the "United States Semiquincentennial Commission Amendments Act of 2020" (the "Act"), which would amend the powers of the United States Semiquincentennial Commission, a commission with the responsibility to provide for the observance and commemoration, in 2026, of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. This moment will mark a historic achievement for our country and deserves commemoration. The Act provides that the Commission will include officials who are members of the House and Senate appointed by congressional leaders, private citizens appointed by congressional leaders, and nonvoting ex officio members from the executive branch. I wholeheartedly welcome the participation of Members of Congress and private citizens in the activities of the Commission. In accord with President Reagan's signing statement in 1983 and President Obama's signing statement in 2016 for similar commemorative legislation, I understand, and my Administration has so advised the Congress, that because the Commission includes Members of Congress and congressional appointees, the Commission may provide advice and recommendations, and may participate in ceremonial activities, but may not participate in matters involving the execution of the laws, in light of the separation of powers and the Appointments and Ineligibility Clauses of the Constitution.
