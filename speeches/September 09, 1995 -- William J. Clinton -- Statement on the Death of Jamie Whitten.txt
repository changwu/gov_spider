    It is with deep regret that I learned today of the death of former Congressman and Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee Jamie Whitten. Congressman Whitten served Mississippi and our country in Congress for 53 years, longer than any other person in the history of this Republic. He was literally an institution himself within one of the most important of our democratic institutions.
Throughout his long service and especially as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee from the 96th Congress through the 100th Congress, Congressman Whitten dedicated himself to the concerns of the hard-working people of this country. He worked tirelessly on behalf of America's farmers, especially our family farmers, and he never gave up working to build more opportunity for all Americans willing to make the most of their own lives.
The people of the United States and of Mississippi will miss Jamie Whitten. Hillary and I send our sympathies to his family and loved ones.
