    Great news out of New Hampshire today as Jeb starts his week there before the primary. A new Harper Polling survey shows Governor Bush in second in New Hampshire, behind only Donald Trump and 2 points above Governor Kasich and the rest of the pack. The results from night two of the survey were largely unchanged from pre-Iowa Caucus results on the first night of the survey.
These results are consistent with the momentum we saw on the ground in New Hampshire before the Iowa caucuses and the movement upwards we continue to see and have seen in South Carolina as well.
Trump 31
Jeb 14
Kasich 12
Rubio 10
Cruz 9
Christie 6
