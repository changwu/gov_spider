    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(FINAL - AS SENT TO HILL)
(House)(Roe (D) New Jersey)
The Administration supports H.R. 4380, the authorization of the Superconducting Super Collider Project, and is committed to its construction. The Superconducting Super Collider is a major component of the Administration's initiative to strengthen America's position in science and technology. There are, however, several changes that are recommended to bring the legislation more fully into conformity with Administration policy. Specifically, the Administration supports changes that would:
—  Require the successful completion of a magnet assembly test, involving 10 prototype magnets assembled by industry before allowing funds to be spent on tunnel construction. Premature tunnel construction could result in unnecessary costs and project delays.
—  Make it clear that while the United States is desirous of receiving foreign assistance for the construction of the SSC, and is concerned that American industry receive the technological advantages that may accrue during construction, the bill should not include language (i.e. Section 9) that is contrary to current U. S. policy and law that seeks to achieve non-discriminatory trade and investment.
—  Delete the provision providing the State of Texas with a refund of its contribution if the project is terminated. This provision would establish an adverse precedent for other Federal projects.
The Administration supports H.R. 4380 and the modifications outlined above.
