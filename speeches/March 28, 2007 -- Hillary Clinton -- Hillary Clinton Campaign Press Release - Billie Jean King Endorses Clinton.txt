    Sports legend and social activist Billie Jean King announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton today.
"What I learned when I first met Hillary, and what I know now, is that she is qualified to lead this country. As a young woman, mother, advocate, First Lady and Senator she has continually shown us she is passionate about improving family issues, healthcare, equal pay and the challenges that people all across this nation face on a daily basis," King said. "Hillary and I both believe strongly in equal rights and opportunities for all people. She is a winner and I am standing beside her because she has the vision, the drive and the knowledge to lead this country."
Named one of the "100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century" by Life Magazine, King gained worldwide acclaim when she defeated Bobby Riggs in the famous Battle of the Sexes tennis match in 1973. Over the course of her hall of fame career, King won 39 Grand Slam titles and helped start the first professional tour for women's tennis. She also founded the Women's Tennis Association, the Women's Sports Foundation, and co-founded World TeamTennis.
In 2006, the U.S. Tennis Association renamed the home of the U.S. Open the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in honor of King's contributions to tennis, sports and society. The Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center will be part of the new National Sports Museum in downtown New York City, which is set to open in 2008.
A tireless advocate for equal rights and opportunities for all, King has received numerous honors for her efforts to fight AIDS, promote equality and recognition of gays and lesbians and for her work on a number of gender equity issues and causes.
"Billie Jean King is an inspiration to women everywhere who were told they couldn't compete in sports and in life," Clinton said. "She has spent her life breaking down barriers, and I'm honored to have her support."
