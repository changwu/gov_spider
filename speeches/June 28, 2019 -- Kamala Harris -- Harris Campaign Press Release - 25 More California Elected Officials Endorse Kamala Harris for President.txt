    This latest show of home state support brings Harris' California endorsement total to over 100
On the heels of Senator Kamala Harris' commanding victory in the Democratic primary debate last night, 25 California elected officials came out in support of their home state senator. This brings her total of California endorsements to over 100 -- demonstrating widespread support for Harris across a critical primary state.
Newly-elected State Senator Lena Gonzalez is among the local elected officials endorsing Harris today. A leader in expanding access to STEM training and jobs for underserved communities as well as an accomplished elected official, Gonzalez-Fletcher points to Harris' 3AM agenda as the primary reason why she supports her campaign.
"One person stood out on the debate stage as presidential material: Kamala Harris," said State Senator Lena Gonzalez. "As the daughter of an immigrant and a Teamster truck driver, I've seen first-hand the challenges working-class families face. As a lifelong supporter of unions and a passionate advocate for Dreamers, I know Kamala will fight for people like us from the White House. And after her powerful debate performance, it's clear she's exactly what our party and our country needs."
