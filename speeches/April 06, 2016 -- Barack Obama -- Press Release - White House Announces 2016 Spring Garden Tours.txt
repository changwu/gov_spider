    APRIL 16 & 17, 2016
This Spring, the White House will be opening its gardens and grounds to visitors on Saturday, April 16 from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM EDT, and Sunday, April 17 from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM EDT. During this event, visitors can see the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden, and South Lawn of the White House.
Additionally, guests will be able to visit the White House Kitchen Garden – originally established by First Lady Michelle Obama in 2009 and the first vegetable garden at the White House since Eleanor Roosevelt's Victory Garden. Mrs. Obama planted the garden to initiate a national conversation around the health and wellbeing of our nation—a conversation that evolved into her Let's Move!initiative. You can follow the White House Kitchen Garden on Instagram at @WHKitchenGarden.
This event is free and open to the public; however, a ticket is required for all attendees (including small children). The National Park Service will distribute free, timed tickets at the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion located near 15th and E Streets Northwest on each tour day beginning at 9:00 AM. Tickets will be distributed -- one ticket per person -- on a first-come, first-served basis.
