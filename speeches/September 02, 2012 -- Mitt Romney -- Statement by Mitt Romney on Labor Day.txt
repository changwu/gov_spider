    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on Labor Day:
"Labor Day is a chance to celebrate the strong American work ethic. But for far too many Americans, today is another day of worrying when their next paycheck will come. Over 23 million Americans are struggling for work and job creation has not returned to our economy the way it should. Even President Obama has said we aren't better off today than we were four years ago. My plan for a stronger middle class will champion small businesses, create millions of good jobs, and build a better future for our country."
