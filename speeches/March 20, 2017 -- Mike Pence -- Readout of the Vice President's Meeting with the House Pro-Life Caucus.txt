    The Vice President today met with Chairman Chris Smith and members of the House Pro-Life Caucus to discuss the American Health Care Act and President Trump's commitment to repealing and replacing Obamacare with a health care system that actually works. The House legislation, which could be considered by the House of Representatives this week, includes protections against taxpayer funding being used for abortions. The National Right to Life Committee last week endorsed the American Health Care Act for 'restoring the longstanding principles of the Hyde Amendment with respect to federally funded health coverage.' At the conclusion of the meeting, Vice President Pence reaffirmed his and President Trump's ongoing commitment to protecting the lives of the unborn.
