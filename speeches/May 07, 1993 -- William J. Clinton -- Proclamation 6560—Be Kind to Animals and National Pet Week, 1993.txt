  A Proclamation

Throughout our history, animals have played an important part in our lives. In colonial times, we relied on animals to carry us and our belongings over great distances to our frontier homesteads. When we arrived, they worked with us, sustained us, and helped us earn a living. Today, animals still help us in our economic lives, but they have taken on a greater role as our guardians and companions.
We celebrate this week in order to remember the many ways that animals help us. By serving as guides, animals aid the blind. As lookouts and detectives, animals assist in our military, customs, and law enforcement efforts. As friends and companions, pets befriend our children, ease the loneliness of the elderly and the ill, and entertain our families in our daily lives. We also salute the veterinary professionals and animal protection organizations that help us provide food, shelter, and medical care for animals and pets.
Together with all the creatures of the world, human beings are a part of nature. Just as we must respect our environment, we must treat animals kindly. In recognition of this, the Congress, by Public Law 102-504, has designated the week of May 2 through May 8, 1993, as "Be Kind to Animals and National Pet Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of May 2 through May 8, 1993, as Be Kind to Animals and National Pet Week. I urge the people of the United States to observe this week with the appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventeenth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
