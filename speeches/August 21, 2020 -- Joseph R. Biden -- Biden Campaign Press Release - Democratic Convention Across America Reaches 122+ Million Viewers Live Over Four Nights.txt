    128.7 Million Video Views Across Democratic Convention and Biden for President Social Platforms in Same Period 
Biden for President and Joint Committees Raise $70 Million in Four Days 
Today, Biden for President announced the Democratic National Convention generated more than 122 million views across livestreams on 15+ digital platforms and across broadcast and cable networks. Additionally, Biden for President and its joint committees boosted the campaign's support, raising $70 million over the course of the week â€” days after the Biden campaign raised $48 million in the first 48 hours following Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his running mate.
"We reimagined and reinvented our convention to reach, engage, and mobilize Americans everywhere while showcasing Joe Biden's positive, hopeful, and bold vision for the country," said Jen O'Malley Dillon, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "Our convention sent a resounding message to the millions of Americans who joined throughout the week: vote, vote, vote. Americans are hearing us and they are responding to Joe Biden's call, because IWillVote.com saw it's two best days of traffic the entire cycle and more than 1.1 million people texted 30330."
The convention displayed growing enthusiasm for the Biden-Harris ticket, drawing:

35.5 million total livestream views over all four days and across the digital platforms of organizations and individuals that streamed the convention
85.1 million viewers across network and cable television broadcasts
564 million impressions, 128.7 million video views, and 31.4 million engagements across Biden for President and convention social platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube
700,000 unique visitors to IWillVote.com, which racked up 1.6 million pageviews over the past four days
More traffic to IWillvote.com on the final night of convention than on Election Day 2018 

One goal of the week was to tell the stories of regular Americans whose lives have been made worse by Donald Trump's failed leadership, and others whose lives have been made better by Joe Biden's kindness, empathy, and devotion.
These moments particularly resonated with the American people after also being posted online as organic content, producing:

8.2 million views on Twitter of the Brayden Harrington's speech about Joe Biden's mentorship in learning how to manage stuttering
Nearly one million views on Instagram of Estella's reading her letter to Donald Trump about her mother being torn away from her family
More than 28 million additional views Twitter of all video clips posted lifting key stories of real Americans, elected leaders, and other speakers

Additionally, because this year's convention was produced with an eye toward sharing content across digital platforms, a number of clips saw significant engagement after they aired live and gained momentum online, including Michelle Obama's full remarks which has over 8 million views on Instagram and Billie Eilish's call to action which has 7.4 million views on Instagram.
