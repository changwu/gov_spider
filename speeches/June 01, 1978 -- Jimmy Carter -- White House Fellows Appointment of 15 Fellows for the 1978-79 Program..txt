It is open to U.S. citizens, early in their careers, from all occupations and professions. Employees of the Federal Government are not eligible, with the exception of career Armed Forces personnel.
In addition to their job assignments with the Vice President, members of the Cabinet, and with the White House staff, the Fellows participate in an education program that includes off-the-record discussions with top-level Government officials, journalists, and leaders from various other segments of private life.
Leadership, intellectual and professional ability, and a commitment to community and Nation are broad criteria employed in the selection process.
