    Vice President Joe Biden spoke today with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about the situation in eastern Ukraine. President Poroshenko informed the Vice President about Russia's direct involvement in the conflict as a result of incidents of ordnance fired at Ukrainian military forces from the Russian side of the border. The two leaders expressed concern with Russian statements suggesting a role for Russian "peacekeepers" in Ukraine, with Russia's ongoing military buildup on Ukraine's border, and with Russia's continuing transfer of weapons to Russian proxies in Ukraine. President Poroshenko reaffirmed his commitment to avoiding civilian casualties and minimizing collateral damage while trying to restore law and order in eastern Ukraine. The two leaders also discussed the possibilities for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.
