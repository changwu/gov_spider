    We commend the House and Senate for passing the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement as a part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. This agreement will establish an environmentally safe and responsible framework to explore, develop, and share revenue from hydrocarbon resources that lie in waters beyond each country's exclusive, economic zones. The Administration appreciated the opportunity to work with key bipartisan congressional leaders to move this important priority forward.
