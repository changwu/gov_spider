    Victory shows that Texas Democrats see Edwards as candidate of real change
Austin, Texas – The Texas Democratic Party announced today that Senator John Edwards won the Texas Democratic online primary by a wide margin. Edwards won overwhelmingly with 38 percent of the vote, compared to 21 percent for Barack Obama and 20 percent for Hillary Clinton. More than 8,000 Texas Democrats voted in the poll, which was conducted between August 31st and September 7th, 2007.
"Texas Democrats are proud of our Party's slate of presidential candidates, and I want to congratulate John Edwards on winning the ePrimary Poll," said Texas Democratic Party Chair Boyd Richie. "Texas voters are looking to Democrats to bring the changes needed in our State. One-party Republican rule has failed, and Democrats are reaching out to ALL Texans—independents and disillusioned Republicans—to return responsible leadership to Texas."
Today Elizabeth Edwards traveled to Austin, Texas to meet with Texas Democratic leaders and attend an event hosted by Texas Young Professionals.
"John's victory demonstrates that Texas Democrats see him as the candidate of real change," explained Elizabeth. "They know that the system in Washington is broken and that the only way to get real change is to elect a president who will fight for change everyday, who has bold new solutions, and who will take on the entrenched interests, beat them and end the game. John Edwards is that candidate."
"Texas voters also support John because he is the only Democratic candidate who can win in red, blue and purple states," Elizabeth added. "John has run for election in a red state - and won. He grew up in a small town in a rural area and that gives him the advantage in connecting with Texas voters."
