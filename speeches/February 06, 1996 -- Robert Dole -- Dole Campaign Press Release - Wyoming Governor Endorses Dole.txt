    Jim Geringer Becomes the 22nd Governor to Back Senate Majority Leader
Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer today threw his support to GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole. Geringer, the 22nd governor to back Dole, has been a leading voice in Wyoming Republican politics since he was first elected to the State Legislature in 1982. Geringer was elected Governor two years ago as part of the Republican landslide of 1994.
"Bob Dole is the only candidate with the experience and tested leadership this country needs in our next President," said Governor Geringer. "He's led the fight to balance the budget and return fiscal responsibility to our government. As President, he'll work to restore the 10th Amendment and send power where it belongs -- the states and the people. This election is about bringing real change to the federal government. Bob Dole is the only Republican who can deliver."
Senator Dole welcomed the endorsement, saying: "It's an honor to have the support of Jim Geringer. He has been a leader in the battle to return decision-making power to states and local communities. As President, I promise to cut through the federal bureaucracy and return power to the people. That means putting an end to the Clinton Administration's 'War on the West,' with its ridiculous regulations and red tape. Our mission in this election is to rein in the federal government, reconnect Washington with the mainstream conservative values of the American people and reassert America's leadership role overseas. Jim's support helps bring that goal one step closer."
Bob Dole continues to lead every national poll by an overwhelming margin. The latest CNN/Time survey shows Dole winning 47% support -- 30 percentage points ahead of his nearest Republican rival.
Wyoming will send 20 delegates to the Republican National Convention next August.
