    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Dreier (R) California)
The Administration strongly supports efforts to enact lobbying and earmark reform legislation and appreciates the progress toward that goal represented by H.R. 4975. The American people expect their elected officials to uphold the public trust and to act in a manner worthy of public responsibility. Strengthening the ethical standards that govern lobbying activities is a necessary step to enhance that trust and provide the public with a more transparent lawmaking process. The Administration also strongly supports the enactment of earmark reform legislation. In the past, Congress has added earmarked funding to large spending bills, and these earmarks rarely get debated and discussed. These earmarks frequently reflect special interests instead of the people's interest. The Administration urges Congress to pass earmark reform legislation that will require greater transparency and justification for this spending. Together with the President's Legislative Line Item Veto proposal and other commonsense reforms, meaningful lobbying and earmark reform can help to improve the budget process and reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending.
