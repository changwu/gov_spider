    Mitt Romney announced today the support of former Secretary of Defense and National Security Advisor Frank Carlucci and former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley.
Between them, Carlucci and Hadley have deep experience in top posts at the White House, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency.
"It is a privilege to have the support of two such outstanding public servants," said Mitt Romney today. "There are few leaders who have such distinguished records working in high office to protect this nation. From their time as young officers in the Navy to their many years advising presidents on a broad array of national security issues, Frank and Steve have served our country with great distinction. I am honored to have their support and grateful to have their counsel."
Announcing his support, Carlucci praised Romney saying, "Governor Romney understands that America's future security depends on restoring our economy and maintaining a military and diplomatic posture that advances both American interests and American values. Indeed, in the tradition of Ronald Reagan, Governor Romney grasps the deep interconnection between the two. I had the honor of serving President Reagan and I know something about his extraordinary leadership abilities. Mitt Romney has similar extraordinary qualities as a leader. At this moment of great global uncertainty, we urgently need him in the White House."
Hadley echoed Carlucci's sentiments, hailing Governor Romney's leadership skills. "Having worked for many years at the highest levels of the U.S. government, I recognize in Mitt Romney the makings of a great president. Over the course of his career, Governor Romney has tackled a wide variety of problems and challenges, and at every step of the way he demonstrated discipline, intelligence, judgment, and courage."
