    Today former ambassador and Maryland congresswoman Connie Morella announced her endorsement of Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign.
Said Morella, "In my lifetime, I have witnessed a shift away from bipartisanship and cooperation in favor of division and pettiness in the public sphere. I truly believe that John Kasich is the only candidate in this presidential race who can reverse the trend and unite Americans behind a positive, commonsense vision for our country. I served with him in Congress when he led the effort to balance the federal budget, and I've watched as he has lifted Ohioans to higher ground as governor. He operates with a clear-eyed vision of the challenges we face and a realistic strategy for solving them."

Morella represented Maryland's 8th Congressional District from 1987 to 2003 and served as Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 2003 to 2007. She currently serves as an Ambassador in Residence for the Women in Politics Institute at American University.
Said Kasich, "Congresswoman Morella has long served the people of Maryland with great integrity and passion. I'm grateful for her support and confident that her expertise will be an incredible asset to our state team as we share our message with Maryland voters."
