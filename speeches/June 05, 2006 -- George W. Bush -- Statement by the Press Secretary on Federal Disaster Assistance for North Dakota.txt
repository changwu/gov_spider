    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of North Dakota and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, and ground saturation during the period of March 30 to April 30, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, and ground saturation in the counties of Cass, Cavalier, Grand Forks, Pembina, Ransom, Richland, Rolette, Sargent, Towner, Traill, and Walsh and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indian Reservation.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
