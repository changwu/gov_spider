    The President. Thank you very much, everybody. We're having a great year. This has been an amazing year for our economy. And meeting these athletes, they're real athletes, I can tell you. It's a tremendous achievement. And we're bringing many of them over to the Oval Office. I guess all of them. So far, nobody has turned that one down—[laughter]—because it is a special place. They want to be there within 25 years, somebody out of here. [Laughter]
So—but we had a—we've had a great time. This has been the best economy we've ever had. We're up again today. We have a lot of things going. The China deal is coming along very well. It's a question of whether or not I want to make it. And tremendous things are happening.
I think we had a tremendous week with the hoax. You know, the great hoax. The—they call it the "impeachment hoax." And that's really worked out incredibly well. And we have tremendous support.
I think Roger is around here someplace. I don't think I've ever seen support in the Republican Party like we do right now. We've never had this kind of support.
Representative J. Roger Williams. We're with you all the way, Mr. President.
The President. Yes, thank you very much, Roger.
Q. Should the whistleblower be fired, Mr. President?
The President. I'll see you over at the—we'll see you over at the Oval Office.
Q. Sir, sir——
Intelligence Community Whistleblower/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine 
Q. Should the whistleblower be fired, Mr. President?
The President. What whistleblower? I don't think there is. I consider it to be a fake whistleblower, because what he wrote didn't correspond to what I said in any way, shape, or form.
Q. Why don't you fire this person then? They're still in your administration, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you very much, everybody.
