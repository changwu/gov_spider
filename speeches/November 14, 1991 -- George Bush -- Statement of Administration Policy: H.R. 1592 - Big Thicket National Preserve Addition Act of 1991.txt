    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/15/91)(House)(Wilson (D) Texas and 2 others)
The Administration supports House enactment of H.R. 1592. However, the Administration will seek an amendment in the Senate to delete the bill's addition to the Big Thicket National Preserve of the Big Sandy Corridor Unit. This area typifies both the eastern hardwood forest and the tropical coastal marsh and is already well represented within the Preserve. In addition, access is severely limited in this area, which makes the unit extremely difficult to manage while offering very limited public use opportunities.
