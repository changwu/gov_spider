    Let me just say a word or two, and at the outset thank all of my friends for coming out to see us off.
I think this trip has great significance, both as to timing and as to substance. We all live in an interrelated world. No longer can we, in the United States, think in the terms of isolationism. What we do overseas has great significance for some of the problems that we have here at home.
This, I think, can be defined as a quest for peace, to broaden it, to strengthen it. And as I said in Arizona earlier this week, I would rather travel a thousand miles for peace than take a single step for war.
We are visiting three great countries. The first is Japan, the first visit of an American President on a state visit to that great country. We have a special relationship with Japan, and although we are separated by the broadest of oceans, we have the closest of friendships.
We also will be stopping in the Republic of Korea, a courageous and brave ally, an ally that joins with us in preserving peace in that part of the world.
The trip to the Soviet Union has special significance. There has been a tremendous effort over the years to broaden an effort of peace throughout the world, and I look forward to participating in an ever-increasing strengthening of our ties with the Soviet Union.
I go with optimism. I think we as Americans can be optimistic about the progress that has been made and will be made. I go with a dedication of service to my fellow Americans and a pride in our great country.
Thank you very, very much.
