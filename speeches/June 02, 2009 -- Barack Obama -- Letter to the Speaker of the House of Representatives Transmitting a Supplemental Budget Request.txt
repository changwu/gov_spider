    Dear Madam Speaker:
On April 30, I wrote to you to request funding for the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. Since this request, we have learned much about the outbreak and the level of national response that possibly could be necessary in the coming months. There also remains much uncertainty about the outbreak and its potential to return during the upcoming flu season in the United States.
Out of an abundance of caution, I ask the Congress to consider an additional and contingent request for $2 billion and other authorities to enhance our Nation's capability to respond to the potential spread of this outbreak. These funds should be provided with maximum flexibility to allow us to address this emerging situation.
The proposal also includes an additional $200 million to address the serious humanitarian crisis developing in Pakistan. To date, there are over 2.5 million displaced people in Pakistan, many of whom have fled their homes because of the Pakistani government's counterinsurgency campaign. These funds will provide displaced people in Pakistan with urgent relief and resettlement assistance.
As the House of Representatives and Senate move forward to conference different versions of the FY 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill, I urge the Congress to act expeditiously in considering this important request, the details of which are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
Barack Obama
