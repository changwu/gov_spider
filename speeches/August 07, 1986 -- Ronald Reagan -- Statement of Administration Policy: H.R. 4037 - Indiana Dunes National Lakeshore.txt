    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Visclosky (D) Indiana and three others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 4037 because:
— the approved, general management plan for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore does not contemplate new boundaries and the associated land acquisition; and
— increasing the Lakeshore's development ceiling to accommodate low priority construction projects cannot be justified at a time when we face a serious budget deficit.
