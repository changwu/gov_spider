    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Earlier today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, signed Americans for Tax Reform's pledge to the taxpayers of the United States stating that as president he will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.
"Grover Norquist, at Americans for Tax Reform since 1986, has given voters tangible proof of which candidates won't raise their taxes and which candidates will," said Ted Cruz. "My record supporting tax cuts is clear, and I am pleased to be able to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge again as a candidate for president so taxpayers can be assured that I will do what I say I will do."
"Senator Ted Cruz is a strong and consistent advocate for taxpayers," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. "He signed the pledge as a candidate for the Senate in 2012. He has kept that commitment to the people of Texas and in the Senate has fought to reduce federal spending and the nation's tax burden."
