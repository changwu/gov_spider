    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 81 proposals to rescind a total of $11.1 billion in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am proposing to reduce authority to incur obligations for direct loans by a total of $751.8 million and I am reporting one new deferral of $3.4 million. These proposals are an integral part of my plan to reduce government spending.
The details of the rescission proposals and the deferral are contained in the attached reports.
