In his statement announcing his decision, Brownback highlighted Marco's ability to bring the party together:
Marco Rubio is a true conservative who can unite the party and defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the fall.
In the past, conservatives have been forced to make a choice between their head and their hearts. This year, we are fortunate to not have to make that choice. Marco Rubio has a proven track record of protecting life, defending religious liberty, and undoing Obamacare. He will be a wonderful President, and I am proud to offer him my full support.
Governor Brownback's support is a welcome addition in Kansas ahead of their March 5th caucuses. Welcome to Team Marco!
