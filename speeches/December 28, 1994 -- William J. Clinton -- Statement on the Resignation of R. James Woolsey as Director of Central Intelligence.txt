    Jim Woolsey has been a staunch advocate of ond to none. He has taken initiatives to streammaintaining an intelligence capability that is sec-line and improve costly collection systems, improve the quality of both analysis and intelligence, and correct security and management lapses in the critical area of counterintelligence. Jim Woolsey deserves the gratitude of all Americans for his service to our country. He has my deep appreciation.
Intelligence is a vital element of our Nation's power and influence. The men and women of U.S. intelligence must know how grateful I am for their dedicated and often unheralded service.
I remain committed to ensuring that they have the support, resources, and leadership needed to continue their outstanding service to their country.
