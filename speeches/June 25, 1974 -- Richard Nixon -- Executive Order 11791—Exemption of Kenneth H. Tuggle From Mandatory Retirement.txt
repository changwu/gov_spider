    Kenneth H. Tuggle, Commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission, will, during June, 1974, become subject to mandatory retirement for age under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted therefrom by Executive order.
In my judgment, the public interest requires that Commissioner Tuggle be exempted from such mandatory retirement.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Kenneth H. Tuggle from mandatory retirement until December 31, 1975.
