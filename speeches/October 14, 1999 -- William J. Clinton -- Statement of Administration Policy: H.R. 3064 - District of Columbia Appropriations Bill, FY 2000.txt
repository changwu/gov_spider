    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Sponsor: Istook (R), Oklahoma)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on a revised version of the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, FY 2000. The President vetoed H.R. 2587, the "District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2000," because it contained numerous provisions that prevent local residents from making their own decisions about local matters, as they should under home rule. The new bill makes virtually no significant improvements from the vetoed bill. Thus, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto this revised bill if it were presented to him in its current form. We stand ready to work with the Congress to pass a bipartisan bill that the President can support, one that is consistent with home rule.
