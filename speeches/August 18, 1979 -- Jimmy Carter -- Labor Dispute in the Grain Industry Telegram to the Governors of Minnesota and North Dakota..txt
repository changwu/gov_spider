    Following our conversations yesterday aboard Air Force One regarding the current work stoppage between the American Federation of Grain Millers and the grain companies in Duluth, Minn., and Superior, Wis., I have today directed the head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Wayne L. Horvitz, to become personally involved in these negotiations, and to provide whatever assistance he feels is necessary to help bring about an immediate end to this dispute.
In this effort I have also called upon all parties directly involved to participate in a resumption of negotiations with Director Horvitz beginning on Tuesday, August 21, in the Minneapolis offices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
In addition, I have asked the parties to continue bargaining until an all-out exhaustive effort has ended this strike.
I share your deep concern about this lingering dispute and will appreciate any assistance you may offer, should Director Horvitz call upon you.
JIMMY CARTER
