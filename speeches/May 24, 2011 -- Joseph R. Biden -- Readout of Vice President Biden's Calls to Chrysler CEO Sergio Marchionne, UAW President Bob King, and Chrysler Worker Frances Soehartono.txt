    Earlier today, Vice President Biden called Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler; Bob King, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW); and Frances Soehartono, a worker from Chrysler's Jefferson North Plant, to congratulate them on Chrysler's repayment of $10.6 billion in U.S. government loans more than six years ahead of schedule. Vice President Biden hailed Chrysler's return to profitability and recent job creation, expressing confidence that today's milestone marks a turning point for the entire American auto industry. Vice President Biden acknowledged the tremendous sacrifices made by many Chrysler workers and their families over the past two years, and he emphasized his conviction that Chrysler's historic turnaround is due to the high quality of American workmanship and the dedication of workers like Frances Soehartono.
