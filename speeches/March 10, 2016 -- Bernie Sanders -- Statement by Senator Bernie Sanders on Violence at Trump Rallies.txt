    TAMPA, Fla. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement after another spectator at a Donald Trump rally, this time an African-American man in North Carolina, was violently attacked by a Trump supporter:
"No one in America should ever fear for their safety at a political rally. This ugly incident confirms that the politics of division has no place in our country. Mr. Trump should take responsibility for addressing his supporters' violent actions."
