    I welcome today's release of the final report of the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
Since September 11, 2001, my administration has transformed our Government to pursue terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks. We established the Department of Homeland Security and carried out the most fundamental reorganization of the U.S. Government in half a century. We significantly expanded our foreign intelligence partnerships with countries across the globe and established the Terrorist Threat Integration Center so that all threat information can be integrated and analyzed in a single location. Our law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working together more closely than ever and are using new tools to intercept, disrupt, and prevent terrorist attacks.
The best way to prevent future attacks is to hunt down the terrorists before they strike again. America and our allies have continued the relentless pursuit of the global terror network. Many of those directly involved in organizing the September 11 attacks are confirmed dead or now in custody. We will not relent until Al Qaida is completely dismantled.
I appreciate the hard work and careful thought that went into today's report. My administration looks forward to working with the Congress and continuing to protect the American people.
