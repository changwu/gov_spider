    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Furse (D) Oregon)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2063. The bill would expand unnecessarily the functions of the National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute. This would duplicate the responsibilities of the National Sea Grant College Program and its Marine Advisory Service.
