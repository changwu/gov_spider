The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!Retweets: 32048Favorites: 112010

I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!Retweets: 30009Favorites: 127523

Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!Retweets: 27724Favorites: 142064

Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally.

...children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn't given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!Retweets: 30202Favorites: 129715

For those that naively ask why didn't the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES and they will gives us 'NONE' for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNewsRetweets: 34525Favorites: 144271

2018 is being called 'THE YEAR OF THE WORKER' by Steve Moore co-author of 'Trumponomics.' It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the 'best job market in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.'Retweets: 25797Favorites: 109238
