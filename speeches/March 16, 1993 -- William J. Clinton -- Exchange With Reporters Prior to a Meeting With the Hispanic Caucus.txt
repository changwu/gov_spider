    Q. Mr. President, what are you doing in this meeting tonight, or this afternoon? Some special—
The President. Well, we're going to talk about a lot of things of interest to the caucus, and I'm going to listen. We're going to talk about the economic program, and they're going to talk about some things that they're interested in in the administration. And they can talk about it when the meeting is over. I'm listening today.
Surgeon General
Q. Mr. President, could you tell us why Dr. Novello is being asked to step down as Surgeon General before her term expires?
The President. I don't know what arrangements—she's going to continue in the Department of Health and Human Services, and I have a very high regard for her. And I told Donna Shalala when I appointed her Secretary of HHS that I had a very strong feeling about wanting my health department director from home to be the Surgeon General, but that I very strongly approved of the record Dr. Novello has made and I hoped that we could persuade her to stay on. And this is an arrangement they all worked out. I don't know the details and the timing. I can't comment on it. I just don't know anything about that.
