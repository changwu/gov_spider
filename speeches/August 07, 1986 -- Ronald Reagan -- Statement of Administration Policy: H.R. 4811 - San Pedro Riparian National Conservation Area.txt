    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Kolbe (R) Arizona and four others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4811, which would designate the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area of approximately 43,000 acres in Cochise County, Arizona, but will seek amendments in the Senate to delete the provisions of the bill that unnecessarily (1) close the Area to mining and mineral leasing; (2) contain burdensome reporting requirements; and (3) require the establishment of a Multiple Use Advisory Council.
