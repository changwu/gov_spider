    We deeply regret and are profoundly saddened by the decision of People magazine to print a cover story featuring our daughter, Chelsea. For over 6 years, the media has understood and respected the unique situation facing Chelsea as she grows up in the spot light focused on her parents. Other than at public situations where she is an integral part of our family, Chelsea has not taken on a public role. We have been very grateful for the media's restraint in allowing Chelsea the privacy that any young person needs and deserves.
Unfortunately, despite personal appeals with respect to her privacy and her security from her parents, People magazine has chosen to run the story. We can only hope that the media will continue its policy of restraint with respect to our daughter.
