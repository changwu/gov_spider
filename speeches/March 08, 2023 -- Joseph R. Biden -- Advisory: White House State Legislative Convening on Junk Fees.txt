    Today at 1:00 PM EST, the White House will host a virtual convening of state legislators from across the country to discuss ways to address the proliferation of junk fees in their states. The Biden-Harris Administration is undertaking a government-wide effort to give families more breathing room by addressing these fees—which has spurred additional private sector action—and is encouraging state leaders to address them as well.
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs; Ambassador Susan Rice, Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor; Lael Brainard, Assistant to the President and National Economic Council Director; and Rohit Chopra, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will deliver remarks. Several state lawmakers will present on actions they are taking to lower costs by reducing or eliminating junk fees. Hundreds of state officials have been invited to join the convening, and the White House will release a Guide for States: Cracking Down on Junk Fees to Lower Costs for Consumers.
Watch the full convening here.
