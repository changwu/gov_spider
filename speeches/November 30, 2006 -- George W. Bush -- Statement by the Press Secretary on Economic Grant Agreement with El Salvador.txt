    On November 29, the United States and the Government of El Salvador signed a $461 million grant agreement that seeks to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region where more than 50 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. The Compact will improve the lives of approximately 850,000 Salvadorans through strategic investments in education, public services, agricultural production and rural business development, and transportation infrastructure.
The United States congratulates the people of El Salvador for reaching this significant achievement and developing a program that will create more opportunities for Salvadorans. El Salvador is a valued partner and we stand with them in the fight against poverty.
