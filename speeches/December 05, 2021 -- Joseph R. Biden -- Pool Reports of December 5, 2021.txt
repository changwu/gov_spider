WH in-town pool report 3
Pool is gathered on South Lawn awaiting POTUS imminent arrival.



December 5, 202113:08

WH in-town pool report #4 
Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 12:56 p.m.
POTUS and FLOTUS existed at 12:59 pm.
POTUS was dressed in jeans and a navy blue winter jacket.
FLOTUS was wearing a long winter coat, accented with a colorful scarf.
He didn't come over to the press line as reporters shouted questions about Senator Dole's death and whether Biden has had a chance to speak to Elizabeth Dole by phone.
He stopped briefing and shouted something to reporters before he continued into the residence. He was too far from pool so whatever he said was inaudible over the continued hum from Marine One. Trying to see if I can get clarification.

WH in-town pool report #11
Biden wrapped his remarks after about 20 minutes.
Again, stream is available online, but a few highlights:Biden joked with SNL's Lorne Michaels about the show's struggle casting a "Joe Biden."
Later, after Biden recognized Steve Martin, former SNL cast member, longtime friend of Michaels and past Kennedy Center honoree, in the crowd, and Martin quipped "Want me to play you?"
After the program, as pool was ushered back out of the White House, revelers headed to a holiday-decorated reception, where they were greeted with flutes of champagne. The music, which was very horn-heavy, was very cheerful.
President Biden, the First Lady, Vice President Harris and the Second Gentleman are scheduled to attend the Kennedy Center Honors event at the Kennedy Center at 7 p.m.

WH in-town pool report #13
As of 7:08 pm, the motorcade is on the move to the Kennedy Center. Pool van was far back and it’s dark so we couldn’t see POTUS.

WH in-town pool #14
Motorcade has arrived at Kennedy Center and pool is holding. Awaiting POTUS formal arrival to his box for the show.

WH in-town pool report #15 
The pool was briefly ushered into the event for the introduction of POTUS, who received a standing ovation.
The crowd is all masked, including POTUS and FLOTUS, VP and SGOTUS, who are all wearing black masks like most of the crowd. Bette Midler is a notable exception with her white mask.
The crowd is tightly packed. Pooler spotted Senator Joe Manchin seated on the back row of the lower section (lower orchestra, right).
Pool was ushered out as Yo-Yo Ma began playing the Star Spangled Banner.
Pool is now holding in a separate room in the Kennedy Center with a small tv with the show on and a light spread of food.

WH in-town pool report #15 
Tonight's event is scheduled to be broadcast Dec. 22 by CBS, so here's a bit from what we've seen so far.
Overall, clearly a very festive mood.
At about 9:25 p.m. a 20-minute intermission was announced. Pool room is near the President's box, but we have not seen him.
The program resumed at 9:51 p.m. with address from Kennedy Center chair David Rubenstein. "How does it feel to be in a room and know everyone here's been vaccinated and tested?" he said to loud applause.
He thanked the Bidens for returning to honoring the honorees, to which the Bidens received a standing ovation, and stood to receive.
Honorees remaining on the program are Bette Midler and Berry Gordy.
Some event highlights (Pool wasn't given official programs, so I'm just having to go from what I'm seeing on this small TV feed, which has had interruptions from caterers, who are understandably just trying to get things ready for the after festivities.)
David Letterman opened the show with a nod, without name, to Trump's absence for the past four years from the event.
"It's nice once again to see the presidential box being occupied," Letterman said. "The same for the Oval Office."
From some of the tributes so far: Justino Díaz's program included a duet from his daughters, who appeared to bring tears to his eyes, as well as opera performers and friends who remarked on his life and career.
Several singer-songwriters took part in a tribute to Joni Mitchell, including Ellie Goulding and Brandi Carlile.
For Lorne Michaels' segment, the Kennedy Center stage was basically transformed into Saturday Night Live, with TWO Weekend Update segments, musical guest Paul Simon, and lots of jokes at Michaels' expense.
Several performers, including Michael Che, Jimmy Fallon, Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon made jokes about performing in front of the president. Che: "It’s a bit intimidating to do jokes in front of President Joe Biden" before adding, "C'mon there’s no way he’s still awake right now." (FWIW: The president is, as of the last pan to him in the audience at 9:56 p.m., still awake)

Pool loaded into motorcade at 10:50 pm. Just waiting now.

Bette Midler tribute was just before that.

WH in-town pool report #21
Just wanted to provide a little more color from the Kennedy Center Honors, again an, assumed edited, version will be broadcast on CBS on December 22.
As I mentioned earlier we were given no program for the evening, which made some of the following along a bit more difficult. We're told CBS will be putting out an official program for the event on Monday to promote the broadcast event.
Some of the in-person appearances during the Bette Midler portion included actresses Goldie Hawn, Scarlett Johansson and Barbara Hershey
Among the performances, Tony-winner Kelli O'Hara sang "Wind Beneath My Wings." During the performance, President Biden watched on and at least at one point he appearing to have his hands in front of him in a prayer position. Near the end, it appeared that he and the First Lady clasped hands.
Billy Porter performed a medley of Midler's hits, including "From a Distance" and "Boogie Woogie Boy of Company B," to round out the Midler tribute drawing a standing ovation, including from POTUS and Flotus.
Pool was ushered out early into the tribute to Berry Gordy, so didn't see any notable Biden reactions.
Pool did not see POTUS/FLOTUS while loading or unloading motorcade. By the time we were free to exit the van area, they were both inside the residence.
And that ends a very long and eventful Sunday pool day for me.
Hope you all have a great evening and happy Monday morning.
