    In honor of National Read a Book Day, First Lady Melania Trump is sending Dr. Seuss books to schools across the country, including one of her personal favorites that she and her son have read together over and over, Oh, the Places You'll Go!.
"Getting an education is perhaps the most important and wondrous opportunity of your young lives," Mrs. Trump said, in a letter to the children who will be receiving books. "I encourage each of you to take advantage of these special years while you are in school. Your education will be a lifelong pursuit that will sustain and carry you far beyond your wildest imagination, if you will let it. Remember, the key to achieving your dreams begins with learning to read. Find what you enjoy, anything that interests you, and read about it. Every page will take you on an exciting journey."
After working with the Department of Education to identify schools with programs that have achieved high standards of excellence, recognized by State and National awards and Blue Ribbon Awards, Mrs. Trump plans to send a school in each state a package containing 10 books including: Seuss-isms!; Because a Little Bug Went KaChoo; What Pet Should I Get?; The Cat in the Hat; I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!; One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish; The Foot Book; Wacky Wednesday by Theo LeSieg; Green Eggs and Ham, and Oh, the Places You'll Go!.
National Read a Book Day is observed annually on September 6th, and invites everyone to grab a book they might enjoy and spend the day reading.
