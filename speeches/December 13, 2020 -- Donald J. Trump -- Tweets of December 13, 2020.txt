The RINOS that run the state voting apparatus have caused us this problem of allowing the Democrats to so blatantly cheat in their attempt to steal the election, which we won overwhelmingly. How dare they allow this massive and ridiculous Mail-In Voting to occur...Retweets: 35988Favorites: 171587

The fact that the Supreme Court wouldn't find standing in an original jurisdiction matter between multiple states, and including the President of the States, is absurd. It is enumerated in the Constitution...Retweets: 38618Favorites: 210483

Also, machine glitches (another word for FRAUD), ballot harvesting, non-resident voters, fake ballots, stuffing the ballot box, votes for pay, roughed up Republican Poll Watchers, and sometimes even more votes than people voting, took....Retweets: 31232Favorites: 156467
