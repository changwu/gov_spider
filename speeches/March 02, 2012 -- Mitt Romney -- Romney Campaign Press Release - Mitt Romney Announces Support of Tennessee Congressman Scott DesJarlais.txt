    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Tennessee Congressman Scott DesJarlais (TN-04).
"I'm very proud to have the support of such a principled and independent conservative as Scott DesJarlais," said Mitt Romney. "In his time in Congress, Scott has been a real leader for balancing the budget, lowering taxes, and scaling back the size of government. I look forward to working with Scott to spread that kind of conservative message across the Volunteer State as we work to restore America's promise."
"I have said on numerous occasions that this election will be one of the most important in our nation's history. We face substantial economic obstacles that require the bold leadership and credible solutions that President Obama simply has not provided," said Congressman DesJarlais. "Mitt Romney has the proven experience of creating jobs and balancing budgets. His commitment to lowering taxes, reducing spending, and reforming runaway entitlements is exactly the type of vision needed in the White House."
