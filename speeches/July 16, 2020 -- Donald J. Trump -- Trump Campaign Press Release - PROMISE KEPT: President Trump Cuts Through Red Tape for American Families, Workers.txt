    Joe Biden would plunge the country back into a sea of costly red tape.
From day one of his administration, President Trump worked to cut through the mess of bureaucratic red tape Joe Biden helped create over nearly half a century as a career politician in Washington. President Trump kept his promise to provide regulatory relief and cut costs for American families and small businesses.
For every new regulation, President Trump cut seven, saving the economy $50 billion in regulatory costs and reducing the costs of goods, which particularly helps Americans with less income. The Trump Administration's historic efforts to streamline regulations are projected to boost household income by more than $3,000, and allow families to buy cheaper cars, cheaper appliances, and cheaper prescription drugs.
Joe Biden would undo all this great progress, drowning America's economy in a sea of costly red tape. When Biden was vice president, $872 billion worth of new regulations were imposed on the economy, creating an estimated 583 million hours of paperwork for American workers. Now Biden wants to do it a again with a series of Green New Deal-inspired regulations that would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs, cost tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary costs, and spike families energy bills by double digits.
President Trumpo is right: the Trump Administration ended the Obama-Biden regulatory assault on America's workers. Joe Biden is pledging to bring it back.
