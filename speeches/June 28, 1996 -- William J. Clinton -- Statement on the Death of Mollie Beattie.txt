    America lost one of its great spirits with the untimely passing of Mollie Beattie. Mollie was a person who believed in the value of life and wildlife so deeply that she dedicated her many talents to preserving God's gracious Earth.
As the first woman director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Mollie presided over a sea change in the administration of the Endangered Species Act by improving the way Government worked. She was the number one advocate for our national wildlife refuges, forever fighting to keep the system strong and growing.
Mollie Beattie's devotion to this Earth and its creatures was passionate, caring, and wise. There is a grace and natural beauty in America; because of Mollie our country has even more of that grace. Hillary and I send our prayers and sympathies to Mollie's family. We will miss her.
