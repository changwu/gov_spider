     Missouri Congressman Sam Graves today made the following statement on President Obama's claim that his economic policies have "worked":
"If the half-million jobs lost since Barack Obama became president are proof that his economic plan has 'worked,' then I dare not imagine what failure would have looked like. It's clearly time to elect a president who knows that small-businesses — not government — create jobs and who possesses the skills, knowledge and leadership to turn our economy around. Mitt Romney has a proven record of private-sector job creation, and his policies will harness the power of free enterprise to grow our economy and strengthen America's middle class."
