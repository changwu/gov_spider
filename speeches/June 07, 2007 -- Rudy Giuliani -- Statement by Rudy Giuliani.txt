    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement today from Rudy Giuliani regarding the failed test vote on the immigration legislation before the United States Senate:
"The American people demand that their politicians enact an immigration reform bill that addresses security first. I cannot support any immigration deal that compromises on this basic principle.
"This bill failed to guarantee a uniform, tamper-proof, biometric identification card, a single nation-wide database of foreigners in our country, and did not mandate the full implementation of a biometric check-in, check-out system. We can and must guarantee the American people that we know who is coming in and out of our country.
"As President, my administration will dedicate itself to assuring the American people that we have a secure border."
