    I am pleased to release today a list of countries eligible for trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and African Growth and Opportunity Act, legislation enacted last spring. By expanding our trade relationship with 34 sub-Saharan African countries and 24 Caribbean Basin countries, we will help promote economic development, alleviate global poverty, and create new economic opportunities for American workers and businesses. This action truly marks a new era of stronger relations between the United States and our friends in the Caribbean, Central America, and Africa.
