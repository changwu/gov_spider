    Mike Leiter's entire career has been one of service to our Nation, and I know his decision to leave the National Counterterrorism Center was undoubtedly a difficult one for him. Serving in two administrations since 2007, Mike led the National Counterterrorism Center with dedication and unwavering determination during challenging and demanding times, and our Nation is grateful for his many contributions to our safety and security. Mike has been a trusted adviser to me and to the entire national security team, providing us with an in-depth understanding of terrorist activities that affect our Nation's security. I am confident that Mike will be leaving the National Counterterrorism Center, the counterterrorism community, and the Nation in a significantly stronger position to confront the terrorist threats we face.
