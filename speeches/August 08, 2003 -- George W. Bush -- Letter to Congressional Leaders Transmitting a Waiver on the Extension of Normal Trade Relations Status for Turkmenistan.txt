    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to a waiver of the application of subsections 402(a) and (b) of that Act to Turkmenistan.
I report in that document my determination that such a waiver will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. I have instructed the Secretary of State to provide a copy of that determination to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate. I have also provided a separate report, prepared by my Administration, indicating that I have received the assurances with respect to the emigration practices of Turkmenistan required by section 402(c) (2)(B) of the Act.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
