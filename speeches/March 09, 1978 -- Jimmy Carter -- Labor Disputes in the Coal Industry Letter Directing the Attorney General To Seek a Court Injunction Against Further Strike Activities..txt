    To Attorney General Griffin Bell
On March 6, 1978, by virtue of authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 176), I issued Executive Order 12042. This Order created a Board of Inquiry to inquire into the issues involved in a labor-management dispute in the bituminous coal industry which has halted the production of bituminous coal in almost every major coal producing state east of the Mississippi River.
On March 9, 1978, I received the Board's written report in this matter, which indicates that there is little chance of a prompt settlement of this dispute. A copy of this report is attached. I have also directed that a copy be filed with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and be made available to the public.
In my opinion this unresolved labor dispute has resulted in a strike affecting a substantial part of the bituminous coal industry of the United States. As a result of dwindling coal stocks in the affected region, electricity curtailments are in effect, the production of materials and parts essential to manufacturing industries has decreased, and unemployment has increased and threatens to increase drastically if the coal strike is allowed to continue. This strike, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national health and safety.
Therefore, in order to remove this peril and to secure the resumption of bituminous coal production, I direct you at this time, pursuant to the provisions of Section 208 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 178), to petition in the name of the United States in any District Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties to enjoin the continuance of such strike in the bituminous coal industry and for such other relief as may in your judgment be necessary or appropriate.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Griffin B. Bell, The Attorney General, Washington, D.C. 20530]
