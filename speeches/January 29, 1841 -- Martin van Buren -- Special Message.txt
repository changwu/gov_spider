    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
By the report of the Secretary of State herewith communicated and the accompanying papers it appears that an additional appropriation is necessary if it should be the pleasure of Congress that the preparatory exploration and survey of the northeastern boundary of the United States should be completed.
M. VAN BUREN.
