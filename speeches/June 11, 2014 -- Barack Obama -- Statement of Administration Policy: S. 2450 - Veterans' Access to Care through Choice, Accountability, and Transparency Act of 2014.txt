(Senate)
(Senator Sanders, I-Vermont, and 22 cosponsors)
The Administration recognizes and appreciates the service and sacrifice made by servicemembers and veterans on behalf of the American people, and is committed to ensuring that we care for and honor our servicemembers, veterans, and their families. S. 2450 would make a number of changes to authorities related to, among other things, improving access to care, training and hiring of health care staff, health care related to military sexual trauma, and veterans' education benefits. The bill reinforces a number of the Administration's efforts to address the challenges facing today's servicemembers, veterans, and their families. S. 2450 supports efforts to continue improving veterans' access to healthcare, including for victims of military sexual trauma, and expanded access to education benefits for veterans.
Our number one priority is getting veterans the care they've earned. To do that, we need to make sure that the problems identified at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities get fixed. This is why the President immediately directed VA to investigate these issues. VA is taking a number of immediate actions to enhance timely access to care across the country, and will continue to do so.
The Administration strongly supports S. 2450 and looks forward to working with the Congress, and our veteran stakeholder community, to continue to promote the efficient use of taxpayer dollars while properly defining and implementing timely solutions to ensure that our veterans receive the care they've earned.
