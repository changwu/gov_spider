    Washington, DC—Today at the Vice President's Residence, Second Lady Karen Pence, joined by the Congressional Club and the Comfort Crew for Military Kids, assembled 500 care packages for military children. Each kit contains an animated DVD to let kids know they aren't alone; a guided journal with prompts that provides a safe place to get negative emotions out and on paper; a teddy bear that offers comfort and companionship; a guidebook that contains information for the whole family; and items to help keep the family connected during the separation.
"We packed the kits with care and respect for the sacrifices military families make every day," said Mrs. Pence. "I am looking forward to distributing the kits next week to children with a parent deployed during my visit to Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Thank you to the Comfort Crew for Military Kids for collaborating with us on this important project, and helping us to show our support for military families."
Mrs. Pence will distribute the kits on Thursday, September 13 at Fort Carson. To stay updated on this upcoming event, follow Mrs. Pence on Twitter at, @SecondLady.
