    Ray Bliss, the son of German immigrants, was an American who believed in the political process on which this Nation's freedom rests. As chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1965 to 1969, he helped to rejuvenate and unify the party during a critical period of its development.
He understood that the strength of our democracy and the responsiveness of our government were dependent upon the vitality of the party system. He respected his party and those in his party respected him. Nancy and I convey our deepest sympathy to his family.
