    Tonight I received a letter from my Attorney General-designate, Ms. Zoe Baird, asking that I withdraw her nomination to lead the United States Department of Justice from further consideration by the Senate.
Ms. Baird is a gifted attorney and a woman of decency and integrity. She responded to the call to public service with energy and a firm dedication to the mission of the Justice Department. Her candid disclosure of the child care matter to officials of my transition and to the Senate Judiciary Committee led to the circumstances we face today.
Clearly, our review process prior to her selection failed to evaluate this issue completely. For that, I take full responsibility. I hold Zoe Baird in the highest regard, and I believe she has much to give to her profession and to our country. I hope to continue to seek her advice and counsel. With sadness, I have accepted her request that the nomination be withdrawn and have so informed the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell.
