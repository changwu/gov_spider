    A Virginia poll released yesterday showed Hillary Clinton beating the leading Republican contenders in general election match ups.
The Rasmussen Reports survey found that in a Presidential match-up with the GOP frontrunner, Rudy Giuliani, Clinton has a 44% to 41% edge. When matched against the newest entrant in the race, Clinton earns 46% of the vote while Fred Thompson attracts 44%. Clinton leads Mitt Romney by four points, 44% to 40%.
According to Rasmussen Reports, "No Democratic Presidential candidate has won the state of Virginia since 1964, but some analysts believe the state's Electoral College Votes could be in play during Election 2008. A new Rasmussen Reports telephone survey shows that those expectations might not be out of line."
