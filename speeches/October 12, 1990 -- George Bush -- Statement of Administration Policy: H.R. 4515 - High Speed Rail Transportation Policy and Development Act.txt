    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Walgren (D) Pennsylvania and 11 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4515 unless it is amended to delete the provision that would inappropriately authorize the Federal Government to guarantee up to $1 billion in loans for development of high speed rail technologies.
The Federal Government is already funding basic research in high speed rail technologies. This research will help States, localities, and the private sector to determine whether proposed projects are technologically and economically feasible. Financing from conventional sources will be available for projects meeting these criteria.
