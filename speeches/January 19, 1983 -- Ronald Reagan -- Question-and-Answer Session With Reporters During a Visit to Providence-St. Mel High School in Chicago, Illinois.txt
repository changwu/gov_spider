    Q. Mr. President, why did you come back to St. Mel's?
The President. I came back to see the progress that has taken place and what has been done since some of the citizens of Chicago, led by Mr. Ciera Stone, found out about this school and what it was accomplishing here and has taken an interest in it. And they're going to make it possible to expand the opportunities that are available to young people.
This is a most remarkable school, and we've talked about it often in Washington since our visit here.
Q. As long as you're answering questions, can you respond to the GNP going down?
The President. What?
Q. Can you respond to the fact that the GNP went down?
The President. Yes, and I don't think that's too much of a surprise. I understand that probably a large part of that was due to shrinking inventory.
