    The President has accepted with deep regret the resignation of T. Burton Smith, M.D., as Physician to the President, effective at a date to be determined. Dr. Smith spoke with the President at Rancho del Cielo last week and informed him of his desire to return to California to attend to pending family business. The President is deeply grateful to Dr. Smith for his loyal and dedicated service and for the great personal sacrifices he and Mrs. Smith made in moving to Washington. A successor to Dr. Smith will be named in the near future.
