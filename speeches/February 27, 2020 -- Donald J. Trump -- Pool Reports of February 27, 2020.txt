In-town pool report #3
Pool entered Cabinet Room at 5:22 p.m., with participants already seated for their meeting with POTUS on empowering African-Americans (attendee list sent in previous pool report).
Trump mentioned his successes including the pardon of Angela Stanton-King and criminal justice reform. The group was well dressed (likely for reception to follow) and enthusiastic, breaking into frequent applause and chants of "four more years!"
Trump's opening remarks were short, then he asked everyone at the table to introduce themselves. Everyone had praise for the president and for helping on issues of importance to them. A few, particularly Bruce LeVell and Candace Owens, had longer remarks critical of the media and Democrats.
"You lose a fortune being president," Trump said, adding he gives up his $400K presidential salary.
Please check transcript for quotes.
After introductions, Trump told the story of meeting with HBCU leaders each year because they had to come back to Washington to beg for funding. Trump said a bill just passed to provide 10 years of funding.
Trump then slipped into campaign mode, talking about a rally with "Pocahontas" with a couple thousand in the crowd, compared to his much larger rallies.
Trump mentioned the best black unemployment numbers, then moved to coronavirus, saying he got no credit from the media for containing it, claiming he was called a "racist" for closing off Asian countries. Said of the 15 people with coronavirus, just one is "quite sick" and the rest are recovering.
Mentioned gaffes by Biden, mixing up the names of states, but said if he made such a mistake it would be career-ending. "I never get credit" for anything, Trump said.
Trump said his coronavirus press conference last night was quite good and calming. But Sen. Schumer said he was terrible.
"I think it's an incredible achievement what our county's done," Trump said in the context of coronavirus. Trump said he took a lot of heat for closing the border but it turned out to be the right thing to do.
Trump criticized the "fake news" media and Democrats at length, mentioning coronavirus funding and impeachment. "This is really above politics," Trump then said of funding to combat coronavirus.
Coronavirus will one day disappear, Trump said. The U.S. is working with other countries, and just 15 cases in the U.S. is a miracle, he said.
Trump noted the NBC reporter had left the room and called the network racist. The president then turned to the black vote, the 2016 election, and criminal justice reform.
At 6:21 the group gathered and stood behind Trump for a prayer.
Asked about the markets, Trump said the press is out of line, said the country is pulling together and Democrats should not make this a political issue.
The event ended at 6:23 p.m. Headed to reception now in East Room.

Excerpts from President Donald J. Trump's remarks at African American History Month Reception (as prepared)…The First Lady and I are thrilled to welcome you to the White House as we proudly celebrate African-American History Month!…In every generation, African Americans have enriched our culture, deepened our faith, strengthened our communities, sustained our values, raised up our conscience, and called our nation to greatness.…Throughout our history, African-American citizens have battled for equality, justice, and liberty—we revere freedom fighters like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall.…In every field, every generation, and every calling, African-Americans have lifted up our nation to new heights – and, like all citizens, you are entitled to a government that puts your needs, your interests, and your families FIRST.…African-American unemployment has reached an all-time low. African American YOUTH unemployment has reached a record low. The African American poverty rate has plummeted to the lowest rate in history. Wages for African-American workers have increased by $2,400 per year.…My administration is fighting for great jobs, great schools, great healthcare, and a truly great future for African-Americans and ALL Americans.
We signed legislation that achieved PERMANENT funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I have called on Congress to give every child a chance to attend a great school of their CHOICE.…Our historic tax cuts created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones to promote investment in distressed and forgotten neighborhoods. I signed Criminal Justice Reform into law—helping former prisoners get a second chance at life.…I will not rest, I will not stop, I will not give up, until we have delivered equal and abundant opportunity to every neighborhood across our land.
