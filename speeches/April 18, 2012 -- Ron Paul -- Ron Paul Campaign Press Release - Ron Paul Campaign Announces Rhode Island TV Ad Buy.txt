LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that it will air itscelebrated ad 'The Plan' in Rhode Island on the heels of Dr. Paul's campaign visit to the state happening tonight. The 30-second spot 'The Plan' will run on broadcast and cable television beginning tomorrow until the state's Republican nominating contest on April 24th.
'The Plan' begins with a declaration that Ron Paul is "a visionary who predicted the financial crisis." Upbeat and hopeful in its tone, the ad centers squarely on Ron Paul's path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint for the nation that continues to earn high marks from fiscal experts, analysts, and political pundits.  Specifically, the ad notes that Dr. Paul's 'Plan to Restore America' will cut $1 trillion in profligate Washington spending in year one of a Paul presidency, balance the budget in year three, eliminate five unconstitutional federal departments, end the foreign wars and nation-building, reign in the Federal Reserve first by authorizing an audit, pay down the crushing federal debt, and cut taxes to create jobs.
"By running our acclaimed spot 'The Plan,' we aim to amplify Ron Paul's already-strong appeal among Rhode Island Republican primary voters. Taken together, tonight's University of Rhode Island town hall meeting and this ad will make more widely known his consistent, 30-year track record of promoting constitutionally-limited government and the restoration of our economic and civil liberties," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
Ron Paul's campaign appearance in Rhode Island will take place tonight — Wednesday, April 18th at 7:00 p.m. ET — at the University of Rhode Island in South Kingstown. Details of the event including how to RSVP can be found by clicking here.
