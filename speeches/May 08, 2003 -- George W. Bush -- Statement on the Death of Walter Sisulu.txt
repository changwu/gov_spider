    I was saddened to hear of the death of Walter Sisulu in South Africa on May 6, 2003. Walter Sisulu was a man of great moral and strategic vision who committed his life to leading the struggle to end apartheid rule in South Africa. Sisulu was a man of principle and humility whose pursuit of an inclusive, multiracial South Africa never wavered through the 25 years of his imprisonment. Walter Sisulu lived to become a free man and to see his vision become a reality. He leaves a legacy of courage and conviction for South Africans and all of us who share his belief in the equality of all people.
On behalf of the American people, I extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Albertina Sisulu, the Sisulu family, and the people of South Africa.
