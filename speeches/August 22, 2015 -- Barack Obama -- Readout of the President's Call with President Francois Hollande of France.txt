    The President spoke today by phone with President Francois Hollande of France, who expressed his gratitude for the actions taken yesterday by three brave young Americans, two of whom are members of the U.S. armed forces, in thwarting what could have been a terrible terrorist attack. The two leaders agreed that the three, along with a French and a British passenger, had demonstrated remarkable bravery and acted without regard for their own safety in order to subdue a heavily armed individual who appeared intent on causing mass casualties. President Obama and President Hollande reiterated their commitment to continue and to reinforce the strong cooperation that exists between our two countries and among our other partners to combat the scourge of terrorism.
