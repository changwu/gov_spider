    A full house of over 500 people came to see Newt yesterday at Pinkerton Academy in Derry, NH. Newt talked about his bold solutions for job creation, his record as speaker balancing the federal budget, and why we need a Reagan conservative to defeat Barack Obama.
At a larger-than-expected town hall event at Pinkerton Academy on Sunday evening, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich laid out his claim as the best Republican alternative to defeat President Obama.
Telling the audience that the country needs a conservative Reagan Republican to make an articulate case against Obama's failed liberal policies, Gingrich touted his work helping Reagan achieve victories in the early 1980s and his role as Speaker of the House passing legislation under President Clinton in the '90s.
Although he spent most of his 90 minutes focused on Obama, Gingrich did make the case for why he would be a more effective nominee than perceived frontrunner Mitt Romney.
"Winning is not enough," he said. "We need to have a leader who is decisive and can move forward with change. What we don't need is an isolated candidate."
Gingrich said the country needs a president who can transcend partisanship, something he said he has achieved on numerous occasions.
He pointed to his championing of supply-side economics under Reagan in the early '80s, a program Gingrich said could once again pay great economic dividends for the country.
Under the supply-side economics, the government cuts taxes, eases regulations, develops American energy sources, and favors people who create jobs.
Under Reagan, Gingrich said supply-side economics worked because he helped garner Democratic support.
"If we wanted to get the Reagan plan through, we needed to get one out of three Democratic legislators to vote for it, and we did that," he said.
