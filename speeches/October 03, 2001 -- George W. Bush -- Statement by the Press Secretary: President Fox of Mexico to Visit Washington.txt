    On October 4, President Fox of Mexico will meet with the President at the White House to underscore personally Mexico's solidarity and steadfast support for the United States in the campaign against terrorism.
This will also be an opportunity for President Bush to express to President Fox the tremendous importance we attach to the partnership with Mexico. The President also wants to convey directly our appreciation for Mexico's immediate steps to boost cooperation with the United States in critical areas following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
