    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Oakar (D) Ohio and 79 others)
The Administration strongly supports the principle of equal pay for equal work as embodied in current law. Moreover, the Administration supports full enforcement of the current law and rejects attempts to undermine that principle. H.R. 3008 replaces the clear standards under the Equal Pay Act with undefined and biased criteria for a study of differentials in pay between Federal Government positions held predominantly by female and male employees. The composition of the mandated commission designated by the bill to judge the results of the study would predispose the results.
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3008. If H.R. 3008 were to reach the President's desk in its present form, disapproval would be recommended.
