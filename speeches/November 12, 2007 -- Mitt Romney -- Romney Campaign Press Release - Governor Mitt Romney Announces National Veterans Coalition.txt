Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President National Veterans Coalition made up of retired service members from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As part of this national coalition, each member will serve as a surrogate to their local veterans' communities for Governor Romney's message of change in Washington.
"Every American is grateful for the very extraordinary acts our veterans have performed so that we may continue to enjoy freedom at home. I am proud that so many of these men and women have joined our effort to change Washington by organizing grassroots support for our campaign across the country," said Governor Romney.
In Massachusetts, Governor Romney worked with members of both political parties to expand benefits for veterans and members of the National Guard. In Washington, he will do the same. Party identification does not matter when it comes to helping and supporting our nation's veterans.
