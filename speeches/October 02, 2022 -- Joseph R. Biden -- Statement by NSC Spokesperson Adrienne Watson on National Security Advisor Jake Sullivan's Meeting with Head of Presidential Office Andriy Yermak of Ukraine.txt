    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in Istanbul with Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak. Mr. Sullivan underscored the United States' steadfast support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He conveyed that the United States and its allies and partners will not be deterred by Russia's flagrant violations of international law, including the United Nations Charter, and will impose severe costs on any individual, entity, or country that provides support to Russia's purported annexation. The two discussed the situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and Ukraine's continued work with the United Nations to export food to the world. Mr. Sullivan emphasized the United States is committed to supporting the Ukrainian people as they defend their sovereignty and democracy, including via the $12 billion in additional assistance that President Biden recently signed into law.
