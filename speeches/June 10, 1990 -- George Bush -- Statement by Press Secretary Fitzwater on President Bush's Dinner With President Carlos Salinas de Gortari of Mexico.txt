    President Bush hosted a private dinner in the White House this evening for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico. President Salinas is in the United States on a private visit to address the Business Roundtable. He will meet with Secretary Baker on Monday, June 11, and with Vice President Quayle on Tuesday, June 12.
At dinner, the two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral and international affairs. President Bush discussed his recent meeting with President Gorbachev and his consultations with European leaders. The Presidents discussed the status of our mutual efforts to fight the spread of narcotics. President Bush reiterated our desire to continue close cooperation with Mexican authorities.
The Presidents focused considerable discussion on economic issues. In 1989 trade between the two countries totaled $52 billion. U.S. exports to Mexico were $25 billion. The United States has $5.5 billion in direct foreign investment in Mexico.
Both leaders believe that the United States and Mexico would each derive substantial and long-term benefits from a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. They agreed that bilateral efforts to maximize trade and investment opportunities can and should complement the trade liberalization achieved in the Uruguay round of the GATT.
Consultations on the free trade issue will continue tomorrow with Members of Congress and in President Salinas' meeting with Secretary Baker. Both leaders agreed on a future course of increased economic and political cooperation between the two countries.
A reception before dinner was attended by the Vice President; Secretary of the Treasury Brady; Secretary of Commerce Mosbacher; U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills; the President's national security adviser, General Scowcroft; Ambassador Negroponte [U.S. Ambassador to Mexico]; and William Pryce, of the National Security Council.
