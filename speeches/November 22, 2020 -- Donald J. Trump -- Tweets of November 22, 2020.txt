Why is Joe Biden so quickly forming a Cabinet when my investigators have found hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes, enough to flip at least four States, which in turn is more than enough to win the Election? Hopefully the Courts and/or Legislatures will have....Retweets: 62455Favorites: 311654

This is not at all frivolous. It is brought on behalf of one of the most respected members of the United States Congress who is disgusted, like so many others, by an Election that is a fraudulent mess. Fake ballots, dead people voting, no Republican Poll Watchers allowed, & more!  https://t.co/mOGdSOeZW8 Retweets: 28675Favorites: 119951

Well, there were hundreds of thousands of votes cast where Republican Poll Watchers were not allowed to watch, not even allowed in the counting rooms. Likewise with Fake ballots cast and dead people voting!  https://t.co/dqHIhObMLs Retweets: 24538Favorites: 104414

Sorry Liz, can't accept the results of an election with hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes cast, enough to easily flip the Election. You're just unhappy that I'm bringing the troops back home where they belong!  https://t.co/elZ9X3wrAz Retweets: 38019Favorites: 169148

Other than politics, how do you lose a case where large numbers of voters, far more than you need to flip Pennsylvania, are disenfranchised? Vote Observers thrown out of counting rooms.
