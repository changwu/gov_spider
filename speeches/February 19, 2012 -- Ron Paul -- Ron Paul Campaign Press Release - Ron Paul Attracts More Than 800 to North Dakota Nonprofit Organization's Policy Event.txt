BISMARCK, North Dakota â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul appeared at a nonprofit North Dakota Policy Council (NDPC) forum on liberty ideas, drawing crowds larger than the 800-seat venue could accommodate. The event, which took place in Williston, North Dakota, was not a campaign event.
Sponsored by the NDPC and titled 'Freedom 101: The Basics with Ron Paul,' the event took place at 7:00 p.m. CST at the Williston High School Auditorium, located at 502 West Highland Drive. On Saturday, November 5, 2011 Ron Paul was a featured guest at the NDPC's Fourth Annual Free Market Forum, traveling to Fargo to give the keynote address.
