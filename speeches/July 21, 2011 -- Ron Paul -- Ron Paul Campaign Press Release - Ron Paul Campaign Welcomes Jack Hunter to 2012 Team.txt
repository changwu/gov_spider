LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The campaign for 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has gained a key media figure with the hiring of conservative commentator and columnist Jack Hunter as official campaign blogger.
"It is a genuine privilege to be a part of the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign," Hunter said. "Dr. Paul's common sense and consistency with respect to truly authentic conservatism has gained wider attention, and he is the one candidate that takes principled stands on every issue."
Hunter, a long-time radio host and The American Conservative Magazine columnist, is a prominent figure on the conservative political scene. He also assisted Sen. Rand Paul with his book The Tea Party Goes to Washington.
"Jack Hunter is one of the nation's foremost conservative commentators and his signing onto the campaign as blogger will be a great help in spreading Dr. Paul's message of limited government and individual liberty," said Ron Paul 2012 spokesman Jesse Benton.
Hunter has worked for WTMA 1250 AM talk radio in Charleston, South Carolina, and writes a column for the Charleston City Paper. Jack also produces widely popular weekly video podcasts. In officially joining the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign, Mr. Hunter has stepped down from his position as an Advisory Board Member of the Revolution Super PAC.
