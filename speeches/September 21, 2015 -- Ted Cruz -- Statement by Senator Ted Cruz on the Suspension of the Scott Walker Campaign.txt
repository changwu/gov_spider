    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement in response to the announcement that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has suspended his campaign for President:
"Gov. Scott Walker is a good man, a formidable fighter, and an effective reformer. Wisconsin is considerably stronger as a result of the changes he pushed through under incredibly difficult and contentious conditions. In the presidential race, his focus on new, innovative policy ideas made the entire Republican field better. I wish Scott and Tonette all the best in their continued service to Wisconsin and the country."
