    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report three new deferrals of budget authority and revisions to a rescission proposal and four deferrals previously transmitted.
New estimates increase by $2 million the amounts associated with my earlier proposal to rescind the uncommitted balances of the Rehabilitation Loan Fund administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Other reestimates cause a net reduction of $8.7 million in deferrals previously reported for the General Services Administration and the Departments of Agriculture and Interior. The new deferrals total $37.6 million in budget authority which would be used beyond 1976 to fund three programs of the Departments of Agriculture and Interior.
The details of the revised rescission and the revised and new deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
