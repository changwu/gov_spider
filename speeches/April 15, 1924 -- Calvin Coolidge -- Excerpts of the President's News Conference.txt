    I don't think there is any comment that I can make in relation to the proposed legislation about the exclusion of Japanese and others, who are not entitled under our laws to take out naturalization papers and become citizens.

There is very little that I can say about the Dawes report. I haven't examined it minutely. About the only expression I can make about it is the hope that it will result in a settlement. There is an inquiry here as to whether that would have any effect on the payment to the United States of the amount that is due it as the cost of the Army of Occupation. I don't understand that it has any effect on that, though as I say I haven't read it carefully enough to be certain. If it had affected it in any way, I am rather certain that I should have been informed about it through the usual diplomatic channels. Mr. [James A.] Logan [Jr.] who represents the Government over there would have informed the State Department and the State Department would have kept me informed of anything of that nature that might affect any claims that were due to the United States.
