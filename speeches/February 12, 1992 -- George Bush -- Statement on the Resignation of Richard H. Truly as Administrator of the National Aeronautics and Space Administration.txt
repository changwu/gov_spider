    I have today regretfully accepted the resignation of Richard H. Truly as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It was almost 3 years ago that I nominated Dick to become Administrator of NASA. As a result of his leadership, NASA is better prepared for the 1990's and beyond. He has established a balanced space program, and he has worked closely with the Vice President in developing our space exploration initiative that begins with Space Station Freedom.
Admiral Truly has now spent 37 years of dedicated public service with lasting and fundamental contributions to the Nation's space program. He has had many significant and historic milestones in his career, but one of the most notable was the way he took over NASA's Office of Space Flight soon after the Challenger tragedy. It was under Dick Truly's able leadership and steady hand that NASA was able to rebuild the space shuttle program and return it to safe operation in 1988.
The Nation owes Admiral Truly a great debt of gratitude, and Barbara joins me at this time in extending to Dick and his family our heartfelt thanks and the admiration and appreciation of our Nation.
Admiral Truly has agreed to remain with NASA until April 1, and the search for a new NASA Administrator has begun. Because of Dick's work, I am confident that we will continue to press forward with an aggressive and innovative civil space program.
