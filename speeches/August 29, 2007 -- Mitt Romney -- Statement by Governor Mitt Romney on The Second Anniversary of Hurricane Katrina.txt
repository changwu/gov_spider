Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina:
"Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the Gulf Coast as they honor the memories of loved ones lost in Hurricane Katrina. We also remember the outpouring of generosity and compassion that Americans demonstrated in extending helping hands to neighbors in need. As we continue to help the people of the Gulf Coast recover, we must recommit ourselves to making sure that the failures of disaster relief on that day never happen again."
