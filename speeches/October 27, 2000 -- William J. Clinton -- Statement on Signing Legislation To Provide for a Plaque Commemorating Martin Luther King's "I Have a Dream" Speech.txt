    I am proud to sign legislation today authorizing placement of a marker commemorating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic "I Have a Dream" speech at the Lincoln Memorial. Few leaders in American history have spoken with the eloquence, passion, and moral force that Dr. King did that day, uttering words that, a generation later, still echo in our hearts.
His call to action captured the spirit of an America struggling to fulfill its promise of freedom, of a democracy yet to honor all of its citizens. Even today, his words still inspire millions of people around the world who believe in the extraordinary power of nonviolent change to bring about social justice.
Let all who visit the Lincoln Memorial pause to reflect upon Dr. King's words and strive to make that dream real in their hearts and daily lives.
