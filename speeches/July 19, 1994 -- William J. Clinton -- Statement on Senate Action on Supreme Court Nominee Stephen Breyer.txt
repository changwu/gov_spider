    I am deeply gratified by the Senate Judiciary Committee's unanimous vote to forward Stephen Breyer's nomination to the full Senate for confirmation to the Supreme Court. Chairman Biden and Senator Hatch deserve enormous credit for their bipartisan spirit and responsible approach to this nomination.
The Judiciary Committee has now given unanimous, bipartisan support to two consecutive Supreme Court nominees. I hope this is a sign not only of the quality of those two selections but also of a return of civility to the confirmation process.
I am confident that the full Senate will act swiftly to confirm Judge Breyer. I believe he will be an intellectual leader on a Court that respects the Constitution. His brilliant mind and balanced approach will make him a superb Supreme Court justice.
