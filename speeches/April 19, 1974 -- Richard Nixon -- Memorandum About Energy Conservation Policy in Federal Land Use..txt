    Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies:
You are hereby directed to consider the national effort to achieve the capability for energy self-sufficiency in all decisions affecting real property, including acquisition, management and disposal; to the end that energy conservation, and energy production, and energy transmission shall be enhanced by environmentally sound land use decisions. The Administrator of the General Services Administration, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, shall review all pertinent Federal regulations to ensure that they are consistent with this policy. The Administrator of the General Services Administration shall submit proposed amendments to such regulations to the Federal Property Council within 90 days.
All executive agencies with real property holdings are directed to cooperate with the Administrator of the General Services Administration in making Federal surplus real property available, to the greatest extent practicable, for energy facilities. The Administrator of the General Services Administration and the Administrator of the Federal Energy Office shall make necessary arrangements to ensure that energy site needs are considered, along with other competing needs, in the disposal of surplus real property under existing laws and regulations. The term "surplus property" means "surplus property" as defined in section 3(g) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 [40 U.S.C. 472(g)].
