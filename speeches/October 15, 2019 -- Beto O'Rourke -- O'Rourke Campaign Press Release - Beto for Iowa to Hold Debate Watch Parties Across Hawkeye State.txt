    DES MOINES, IA â€” Beto for Iowa will continue to engage Iowans in every corner of the Hawkeye State on Tuesday night. Supporters and undecided Iowans will join our team to watch Beto's performance during the fourth Democratic Debate. The debate, hosted by the New York Times and CNN, will be televised and streamed live beginning at 7:00 pm CT.
During last month's debate, Beto changed the terms of our nation's gun violence prevention debate by standing firm in his call for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. He said:
If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers...Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
