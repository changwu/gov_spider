JENNA LEE, FOX NEWS: "What do you think Governor Romney needs to do tonight? Is it more punches, being more aggressive or is it more specific policy?"
GOV. HALEY BARBOUR: "I think what he's going to do is lay out for the American people his vision of where America can go, needs to go, and how he would get there. I think he will talk about issues. Here is what I will do, here is why I will do it, and here is how it will help your family, your community, and our country get back on track. Because we are not on track now. Sure, you cannot run against the incumbent president without his record being an issue. This president's got a failed record of bad policies that have negative results. The American people know that."
