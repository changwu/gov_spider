    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Woolsey (D) CA and four cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2367, the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007. This bill would implement the Administration's proposal to strengthen the Department of Labor's ability to impose significant civil penalties for child labor violations that result in the death of or serious injury to children, particularly where the violation is repeated or willful. Currently, the maximum civil penalty that the Department can levy against an employer that causes the death of or seriously injures a child is $11,000. This bill would raise that civil penalty to $50,000 with the possibility of a $100,000 civil penalty in cases where the employer's violation is "repeated or willful." Enhanced enforcement authority should enable the Department to achieve a higher level of compliance with the child labor regulations, leading to greater safety for young workers.
