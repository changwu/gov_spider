    Atlanta, GA - Today, Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin endorsed Barack Obama for President, citing his unique ability to give voice to America's future and his ability to bring the American people together to bring change.
Mayor Franklin said, "Barack Obama is a dynamic, smart, and experienced leader who has demonstrated the capacity to bring people together across party, race and gender lines. He inspires me and has inspired so many others. As a leader I believe he can build consensus to bring Americans together over the issues we care most about like health care, the economy and foreign policy."
"I'm proud to have Mayor Franklin's support," said Senator Barack Obama. "As the first woman to hold this office in Atlanta and the first black woman to be mayor of a major city in the south, Mayor Franklin is a trailblazer. By breaking down these barriers and by working each day to strengthen Atlanta - and to strengthen Atlanta's families - Shirley is helping bring about the America we know in our hearts is possible. And I look forward to fighting side-by-side with her in the months and years to come."
Shrirley Franklin has served as Mayor of Atlanta since 2002, being the first female mayor of Atlanta and the first African American woman to serve as mayor of any major Southern city.
