THE PRESIDENT. I think I did with flying colors. Comes from good living, you
Q. You are smiling. I guess things are going pretty well then.
THE PRESIDENT. I feel fine, really--a little bright light with the things that are in my eyes, for whatever it is. But other than that, I feel great.
Q. Whatever happened to your experiment with contact lenses? Did that fall by the wayside?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I wear glasses so infrequently I decided it wasn't worth the effort.
Q. Did you get any advice from your doctors, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. To keep doing all I'm doing--recreation, exercise, watching the calories.
Q. Does that exercise include swimming in this weather?
THE PRESIDENT. I swim every day. I swam last night at 10:30. Come out and join me sometime.
Q. Does this mean, Mr. President, that you are going to be skiing in New Hampshire?
THE PRESIDENT. We'll wait and see.

THE PRESIDENT. I weigh less now than I have for 20 years.
