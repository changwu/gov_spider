The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!Retweets: 43979Favorites: 229381

Just found thousands of more ballots, and the recount is relatively meaningless without being given access to the signatures. Consent decree is a scam that Georgia Secretary of State or Governor should never have let happen. Unconstitutional. Open it up!  https://t.co/lBMuyyhgGs Retweets: 1905Favorites: 5760

Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don't Harass!  https://t.co/n5frpesHfD Retweets: 37876Favorites: 139281

This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine glitches all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!  https://t.co/YDh7A7wxLW Retweets: 33060Favorites: 141951

The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!Retweets: 52807Favorites: 249940
