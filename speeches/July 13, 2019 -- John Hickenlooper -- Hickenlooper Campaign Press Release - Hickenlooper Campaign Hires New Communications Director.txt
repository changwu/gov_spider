    DENVER, CO â€” Today, the Presidential campaign of former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper announced the hiring of Chicago-based Peter Cunningham as the campaign's communications director. Cunningham replaces Lauren Hitt, who recently departed from the campaign.
Campaign Manager M.E. Smith said, "Peter is a seasoned communications professional with a good handle on the message that will help us reach voters. He has already brought energy and ideas into the campaign."
Cunningham said, "I am a big fan of Governor Hickenlooper. He is the only candidate to run a business, a city and a state, and has already done many of the things other Democratic candidates are proposing. His blend of pragmatic progressivism is the key to beating Donald Trump."
Over the last three decades, Cunningham has worked for Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, for political consultant David Axelrod, served in the Obama Administration as an Assistant Secretary of Education, founded a non-profit called Education Post focused on improving public education, and recently worked in Bill Daley's campaign for Mayor of Chicago.
