    Mitt Romney today announced California Congressman Jeff Denham as a Statewide Co-Chair.
"My support is growing in California because voters want a change of direction in Washington," said Mitt Romney. "With the help of leaders like Congressman Denham, we can fix our economy, stop runaway spending, and restore America's promise."
"In order to defeat President Obama, repeal Obamacare, and stop reckless spending, we need a proven conservative leader as our nominee," said Congressman Denham. "Throughout this campaign and throughout his life, Mitt Romney has demonstrated that he has that leadership ability. He was a successful businessman, saved the Olympics from scandal, and balanced his state's budget without raising taxes. Mitt Romney's economic plan is just what the country needs to free the private sector and create jobs. It is time for Republicans to unite behind Mitt Romney â€” he is the candidate best prepared to lead our party and lead the country."
