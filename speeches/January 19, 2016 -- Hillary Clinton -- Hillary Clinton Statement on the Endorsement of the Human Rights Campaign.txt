    Hillary Clinton released the following statement in response to earning the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign:
"I'm honored to receive the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign—the nation's largest organization working to achieve full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans. Thanks to the Human Rights Campaign and millions of advocates across the country, we've made tremendous progress. But our work is far from over. Too many LGBT Americans still face discrimination—in employment, in housing, in education, in health care—because of who they are or who they love. And the stakes in this election couldn't be higher. The Republican candidates for president have not only hurled hateful, insulting rhetoric about the LGBT community—they've made it clear that if elected, they will roll back the rights that so many have fought for.
"As President, I will continue to fight alongside the LGBT community to pass the Equality Act. I'll support efforts to allow transgender personnel to serve openly, and I'll end the dangerous practice of 'conversion therapy' on minors. I'll expand access to HIV prevention and treatment, and confront the epidemic of violence facing the transgender community, especially transgender women of color. And I'll continue the efforts I led as Secretary of State to advance the human rights of LGBT people around the world.
"I'm proud to stand with the Human Rights Campaign in this fight. Together, we can and will make our country—and our world—more just, fair, and equal for generations to come."
