    The United States Government is pleased that the Palestinian problem is receiving priority attention among the governments in the Middle East.
We have seen a reaffirmation of Israel's desire to move ahead with the peace process on the basis of Camp David. We continue to have consultations with both Israel and Egypt in an effort to decide how to proceed in our common effort to resolve the Palestinian problem in all of its aspects.
The U.S.â€”this administration, as its predecessors-is committed to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Jordan and our support for its enduring character. We do not agree that Jordan is a Palestinian state.
What it boils down to is that this is a matter for future discussion, the autonomy process under the Camp David accords.
