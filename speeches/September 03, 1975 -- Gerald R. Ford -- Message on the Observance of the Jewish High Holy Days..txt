    MRS. FORD and I send warmest greetings to our fellow Americans of the Jewish Faith as you observe the High Holy Days.
This year adds a special dimension to the meaning of your observance. These solemn days are marked by a traditional exhortation to prayer and self-examination. They mirror in a unique way the general mood in our country as we approach the celebration of our National Bicentennial.
On the eve of the two hundredth year of our independence as a nation, we are joined as Americans in a spirt of reflection, renewal and reaffirmation. This same spirit has united the Jewish people for centuries in the observance of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
Each of you can take deep pride in the profound and positive influence of the Judaic heritage on our national life. The principles that guide you in your religious worship have also inspired countless and enduring contributions of the Jewish people to humanity and social justice. Your values are a great component of our quest for the brotherhood of man under the Fatherhood of God. The inspired leadership and special sensitivity of Judaism in areas of humanitarian concern fill many brilliant chapters of America's history.
Mrs. Ford and I extend our sincere best wishes for the Jewish New Year. May it witness world progress toward fulfillment of the prophets' vision of peace and prosperity for all mankind.
GERALD R. FORD
