    Frank O'Bannon was a dedicated public servant and a good and decent man. He led a distinguished career, including service in the Air Force, in the Indiana State senate, and as Lieutenant Governor. Since being sworn in as Governor of Indiana in 1997, he has served the people of his State with integrity and devotion. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Judy, and their family.
