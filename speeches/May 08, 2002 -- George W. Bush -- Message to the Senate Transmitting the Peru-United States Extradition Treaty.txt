    To the Senate of the United States: 
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Peru, signed at Lima on July 26, 2001.
In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of modern extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States and will replace the outdated extradition treaty in force between the two countries signed in 1899. The Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of the two countries. It will make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts against serious offenses, including terrorism, organized crime, and drug-trafficking.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
