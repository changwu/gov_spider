Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding the comments by Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) and former Senator John Edwards (D-NC) at last night's Democratic presidential debate:
"Last night, Senators Obama and Edwards demonstrated a dangerous naivete about the Castro Brothers and Hugo Chavez. Instead of embracing these brutal dictators, we need to work with freedom-loving people in their countries. Too many have sacrificed in the pursuit of Cuba's freedom for Barack Obama and John Edwards to abandon them now. Too many in Venezuela are working to reverse the dangerous course Chavez has embarked on. We must be steadfast in our vision of a free and democratic Cuba and Venezuela."
Background On Comments By Senator Obama And Former Senator Edwards:
At Last Night's Democratic Debate, Candidates Were Asked If They Would Meet With Fidel Castro And Hugo Chavez. "Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and John Edwards suggested Monday that they would meet with two leaders who top South Florida's most-hated list: Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez." (Beth Reinhard, "Obama, Edwards Say They Would Meet With Castro, Chavez," The Miami Herald, 7/24/07)
- Senator Obama Responds That He Would Meet With Castro And Chavez Among Other Dictators. "During a nationally televised debate, Obama responded to a hypothetical question: 'Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?' The senator from Illinois responded: 'I would, and the reason is this: the notion that somehow not talking to countries is somehow punishing them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration, is ridiculous.'" (Beth Reinhard, "Obama, Edwards Say They Would Meet With Castro, Chavez," The Miami Herald, 7/24/07)
- Former Senator Edwards Suggests He Would Meet With Castro And Chavez. "The question was then posed to Edwards, who said, 'Yes, I think Senator Clinton is right, though. Before that meeting takes place, we need to do the work, the diplomacy to make sure the meeting is not going to be used for propaganda purposes.'" (Beth Reinhard, "Obama, Edwards Say They Would Meet With Castro, Chavez," The Miami Herald, 7/24/07)
