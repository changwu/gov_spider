    President Obama Directs the National Security and Homeland Security Advisors to Conduct Immediate Cyber Security Review
Melissa Hathaway Selected to Lead the Review 
President Obama has directed the National Security and Homeland Security Advisors to conduct an immediate review of the plan, programs, and activities underway throughout the government dedicated to cyber security.
This 60-day interagency review will develop a strategic framework to ensure that U.S. Government cyber security initiatives are appropriately integrated, resourced and coordinated with Congress and the private sector.
"The national security and economic health of the United States depend on the security, stability, and integrity of our Nation's cyberspace, both in the public and private sectors. The President is confident that we can protect our nation's critical cyber infrastructure while at the same time adhering to the rule of law and safeguarding privacy rights and civil liberties," said Assistant to the President for Counterterrorism and Homeland Security John Brennan.
Melissa Hathaway, who has served as Cyber coordination Executive to the Director of National Intelligence, will lead the review and will serve as Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace for the National Security and Homeland Security Councils during the review period.
