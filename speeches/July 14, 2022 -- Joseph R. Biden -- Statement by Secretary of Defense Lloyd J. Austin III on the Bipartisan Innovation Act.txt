    I urge Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act and fully fund the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors portion of the legislation. The CHIPS Act directly supports our national defense. Weapon systems employed on the battlefields of today and emerging technologies of tomorrow depend on our access to a steady, secure supply of microelectronics. Our strategic competitors are making substantial investments in this area â€“ China, the U.S. military's pacing challenge, has already spent $150 billion updating its semiconductor industry. The investments made through the CHIPS Act are critical to our national security, and will directly support maintaining America's technological and military edge.
