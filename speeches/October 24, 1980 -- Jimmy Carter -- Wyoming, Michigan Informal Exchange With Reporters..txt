    Q. Do you know if the hostages will be released on Sunday?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't have any information if that's true. I think it would be a mistake to build up expectations like that, because we have no idea what the Iranians are going to demand, whether or not we can accept their demands, or if they'll even make any demands. I think it's just a mistake for us to assume that the hostages will be released.
Q. So you don't have any new information?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't.
Q. Thank you.
