    I am pleased to sign into law today S. 895, the "Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995." This Act would, among other things, establish new guarantee levels for guaranteed loan programs of the Small Business Administration (SBA).
S. 895, which the Congress passed at my Administration's urging, contains important elements of the Vice President's National Performance Review proposals and SBA's reinvention proposal. The Act is also consistent with recommendations from this spring's White House Conference on Small Business.
S. 895 reduces the Government's cost of small business financing, thereby enabling even more customers to be served. With the program reforms contained in this Act, SBA will be able to extend up to $33 million in additional loan guarantees per day with no additional cost to the taxpayer.
I am pleased to sign this measure into law because it reflects my Administration's commitment to customer service and to "doing more with less."
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House,
October 12, 1995.
