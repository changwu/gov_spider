  A Proclamation

On the morning of April 19, 1995, America was devastated by news of an explosion at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. As rescuers rushed to the scene, citizens across the country waited by their televisions and radios for information, and we prayed for the children, Federal workers, and many others caught by the bomb's deadly blast. Despite heroic efforts of emergency personnel and countless samaritans, 168 people lost their lives as a result of the brutal attack.
For a year we have mourned the dead, aided the residents of Oklahoma City in their struggle to rebuild, and strengthened our resolve to fight terrorism. And though it has been a sad and challenging time, the outpouring of love and support for those affected by the tragedy has helped our Nation to come together in common purpose. As we mark the first anniversary of the bombing, we remember the victims and honor their memory with a moment of silence. In prayer and quiet reflection, let us move forward together to foster peace in our land.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, April 19, 1996, as a National Day of Remembrance of the Oklahoma City Bombing. I ask all the people of the United States to observe a moment of silence on that day at 9:02 a.m., Central Daylight Time, gathering with family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues at home, at work, and in places of worship to commemorate this solemn occasion.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
