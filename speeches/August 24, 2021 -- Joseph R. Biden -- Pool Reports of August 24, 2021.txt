WH pool report 17 - Biden finished — says leaving by Aug 31 depends on Taliban cooperation, also lid
The president concluded his speech at 1715.
He said he expects the evacuation to wrap up by Aug 31, and hopes it will, but that it depends on the Taliban's cooperation.
"It's a tenuous situation."
Said that "every day that we're on the ground" is a day US forces could be attacked by ISIS K.
"I'm also mindful of the increasing risk."
He added that how the Taliban are treated by the international community going forward will depend on how they behave right now.
The press office declared a travel/photo lid at the conclusion of his speech, at 1716.
More complete quotes coming ASAP.

WH pool report 18 -- Some quotes from Biden's speech 
Biden spoke for 12 minutes and did not take questions afterward.
Some quotes:
"We are currently on pace to finish by August the 31st. The sooner we finish, the better. Each day of operations brings added risk to our troops."
"I've asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timetable should that become necessary. I'm determined to ensure that we complete our mission."
Regarding his discussion with the other G7 leaders this morning:
"We agreed that we will stand united in our approach to the Taliban. We agreed that the legitimacy of any future government depends on the approach now taken to uphold their international obligations, including to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for international terrorism. And we agreed that none of us are going to take the Taliban's word for it. We will judge them by their actions."
Biden opened his remarks by praising the votes in the House to advance his infrastructure proposals.
And with that, until next month, barring any late night updates on various things the press office has been updating poolers on, have a good evening.
