    I am deeply saddened by the death of Ella Fitzgerald. The jazz world and the Nation have suffered a tremendous loss in the passing of someone with so much talent, grace, and class. Ella's phenomenal voice and wonderful phrasing will remain close to the hearts of Americans for generations to come. Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to her family.
