Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that is important to the national interest that up to $15,200,000 be made available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (the Fund) to meet the unexpected and urgent needs of refugees, conflict victims, and displaced persons in Africa. These funds will be used for U.S. contributions in response to the appeals issued by the United Nations Special Emergency Program for the Horn of Africa (SEPHA) and by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for its programs in Somalia and Mozambique.
