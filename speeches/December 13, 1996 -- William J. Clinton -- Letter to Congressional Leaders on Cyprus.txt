    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through July 31, 1996. The current submission covers the period August 1, 1996, through September 30, 1996.
I regret that intercommunal violence, including unprecedented killings of civilians, dominated events in Cyprus during this reporting period. These incidents raised intercommunal tensions to their worst level in many years and complicated efforts aimed at achieving a lasting solution to the Cyprus dispute. In meetings with the two Cypriot communities and the governments of Greece and Turkey, my representatives noted that the violence underscored the unsustainability of the status quo and the need for redoubled efforts toward a negotiated settlement. They advised that provocative rhetoric and actions be avoided to permit intercommunal relations to move onto a more constructive track. Similar calls were made by the United Nations and the European Union.
Notwithstanding the tragic events of August and September, my Administration remains committed to promoting a lasting peace on the island. Given the urgency of the current situation, we are appealing again for the implementation of practical measures to reduce the potential for conflict. We remain hopeful that both sides will recognize the importance of such measures and put them into immediate effect.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
