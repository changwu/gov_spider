VP Supplemental Pool #12: Harris remarks, motorcade departs for SF airport
This fundraiser is quite intimate. A White House official said 24 people are in attendance, including California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis.
(Your pooler did not lay eye on the LT GOV)
Your pooler caught the tail end of remarks DMC Chairman Harrison made. Harris stood towards the back of the living room as he made them.
Carol Bonnie introduced Harris. She said she's known VPOTUS for decades and she said she hasn't changed.
"When you see injustice, you stand up and fight. You get mad. I love it."
"One thing you've always done is been there for all of us."
Bonnie said she's less scared of the future "because I know it's you in this position in this administration."
Harris began speaking at 6:21pm PST.
Harris said in early 2020, Bonnie was living in VA during Covid and they grew tomatoes in their home garden. When carol went to visit relatives attending Georgetown, carol brought tomatoes to Harris DC apartment. She planned to cook with them. The next day, Biden asks her to join the ticket and she moves the tomatoes to Delaware, where she lived for much of the 2020 election.
"I'm so sorry I wasn't able to do anything with them."
She said when the Dobbs was announced, she was on AF2 with Sen. Dick Durbin traveling to Illinois for an event on maternity.
"We have elevated the issue of maternal health to the front stage or the White House."
Her team knocked on her door and she said she "instinctively" looked to CNN.
Harris said "elections matter."
Harris touted the administration's accomplishments thus far, including the child tax credit, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, additional HBCU and MSI funding, rally NATO and the EU amid the war in Ukraine and the gun bill.
Harris said the admiration needed to take action to ensure women are free to travel to access abortion and abortion medication.
"Our greatest movements that have produced progress in this country have been fueled by coalitions of people" with little in common, she said.
"We were built for this."
"When you know what you stand for then you know what you fight for."
"Do not despair we have a lot of work to do."
