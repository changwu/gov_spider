(OAKLAND, CA, August 28, 2019) — Next Tuesday, September 3rd, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer will host a town hall with voters in Oakland, CA to discuss his Justice-Centered Climate Plan to fight the greatest challenge facing mankind. In the event, titled A Climate Change Emergency Broadcast, Steyer will also discuss what actions he would take on Day One as president of the United States and take questions from the live audience, and from those watching the town hall via live stream.
"Climate change is the biggest issue facing us, but for too long, all politicians in Washington have done is talk about it. Tom was the first candidate in this race who has pledged to use the emergency powers of the office to declare a climate crisis and take immediate action," Steyer Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves said. "He is excited to meet with voters to discuss his plans and hear their concerns about this critical issue. Climate change is a global emergency, and it will take more than just American action, it will take American leadership. Tom is ready to lead in this fight."
The event will be open to the press and streamed live across Steyer's social media platforms, including:
