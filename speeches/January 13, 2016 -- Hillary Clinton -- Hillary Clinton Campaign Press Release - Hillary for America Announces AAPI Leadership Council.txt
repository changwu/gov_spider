    Hillary for America announced the launch of its Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary Leadership Council– a group of over 150 elected officials, community, and grassroots leaders who will help build a grassroots-driven volunteer team that will help Hillary Clinton engage, energize and organize support in the AAPI community ahead of the caucuses and primaries.
These officials are taking on leadership roles on the heels of the launch of AAPI for Hillary in San Gabriel, California, where Clinton was surrounded by leaders from the community and discussed what's at stake for the AAPI community in this election.
Leadership Council members share Clinton's commitment to raising wages for the middle class, strengthening our nation's infrastructure to create good-paying jobs, defending and enhancing the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that cost is not a barrier for students going to college, reforming our broken immigration system and much more. You can learn more about Clinton's agenda.
"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest growing racial demographic in the country, yet have too often been denied a seat at the table," said Congresswoman and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) Chair Judy Chu. "With the launch of her National AAPI Leadership Council, Hillary Clinton is recognizing the importance of engaging with our community in a way that no other candidate has. Given her policy priorities and outreach, I am confident that AAPIs will have an unprecedented voice and ear in the Hillary Clinton White House."
"I am thrilled to join Hillary Clinton's National AAPI Leadership Council," said Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY). "Hillary has a great track record of fighting for Asian American and Pacific Islanders, and as President, she will do even more to protect and promote the AAPI community. I look forward to working with her to accomplish this."
"Hillary Clinton is a smart, conscientious, and an inspiring leader," said former Ambassador Gary Locke. "She values diversity and has always been supportive of and sensitive to the needs of the AAPI community. She is everything we want in a President and she is the leader we need in these complex and troubling times."
"Hillary Clinton is the candidate we need. She has a proven track record of the compassion and strength needed to unite leaders across the country to solve the problems that affect all our communities," said Shekar Narasimhan. "I am more than grateful to serve on the National AAPI Leadership Council of the most qualified candidate for the presidency."
Over the course of the campaign, the AAPI Leadership Council will continue to expand. Joining the AAPI for Hillary Leadership Council today:
