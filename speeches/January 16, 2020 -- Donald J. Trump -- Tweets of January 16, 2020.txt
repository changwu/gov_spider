One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country, and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!Retweets: 34525Favorites: 166977

Cryin' Chuck Schumer is saying privately that the new China Trade Deal is unbelievable, which it is, but publicly he knocks it whenever possible. That's politics, but so bad for our great Country!Retweets: 28345Favorites: 134846

"There is no crime here. I just think this whole thing should be rejected out of hand. I wouldn't waste a minute of taxpayer dollars or time on this. Entertaining this Impeachment is a joke." Laura Ingraham @IngrahamAngle @FoxNewsRetweets: 20611Favorites: 94572

The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada, but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!Retweets: 23563Favorites: 119136
