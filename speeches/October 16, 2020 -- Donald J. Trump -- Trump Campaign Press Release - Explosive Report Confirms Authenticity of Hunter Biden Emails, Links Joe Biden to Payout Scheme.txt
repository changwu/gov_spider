    In an explosive Fox News report Friday night, a source included in Hunter Biden's emails "has corroborated the veracity of the messages, which appear to outline a payout for former Vice President Joe Biden as part of a deal with a Chinese energy firm."
The Trump campaign issued the following statement:
"Joe Biden can no longer ignore this massive and growing scandal and the news media can no longer avoid asking him about it. This is verification that Hunter Biden's emails are authentic and that Hunter was cashing in by selling Chinese businessmen access to his father. This also confirms that payment for Joe Biden himself was discussed as part of compensation being arranged through a Chinese energy company. Joe Biden, a candidate for President of the United States, appears to be compromised by the Chinese."
