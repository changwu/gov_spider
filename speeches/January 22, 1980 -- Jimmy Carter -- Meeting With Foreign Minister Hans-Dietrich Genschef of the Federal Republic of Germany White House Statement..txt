    The President met this morning with Federal Republic of Germany Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Vice President Mondale, Secretary of State Vance, and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski participated in the discussion.
The President and the Foreign Minister reviewed the international situation following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. They analyzed the security implications of the Soviet action, overwhelmingly condemned by the United Nations General Assembly, and agreed that such aggression must not go unanswered. The President and the Foreign Minister were united in their belief that the international community must respond to the Soviet action and that comprehensive Western solidarity will be especially important to counter the danger posed by the situation in Afghanistan. They stressed the need for concrete measures to make clear to the Soviet Union the cost of its action.
The President told the Foreign Minister he anticipated with pleasure the March visit of Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, which will provide another timely opportunity for close consultations between the United States and a major Alliance partner.
