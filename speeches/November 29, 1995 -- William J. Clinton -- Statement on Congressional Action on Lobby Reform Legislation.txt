    I am delighted that Congress has passed lobby reform legislation. This bill will help change the way Washington does business. For too long, Washington's influence industry has operated out of the sunlight of public scrutiny. This new law will require professional lobbyists, for the first time, to fully disclose who they are working for and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill. Lobby reform will be good for American democracy and will help restore the trust of the people in their Government.
This is precisely the sort of change that the American people have demanded and that I championed during my campaign for the Presidency and as President. I am particularly pleased that a strong bipartisan coalition in both the House and Senate stood firm for reform. I want to especially thank Senator Carl Levin, who championed this legislation for many years, and the other Members for their leadership, including Senator Bill Cohen and Representatives Barney Frank, John Bryant, and Charles Canady.
Since I took office, I have challenged Congress to enact four significant political reform measures: legislation applying laws to Congress, a ban on gifts to lawmakers, lobby disclosure, and campaign finance reform. The Congress has now acted on the first three of these reform priorities. It is time to finish the job.
