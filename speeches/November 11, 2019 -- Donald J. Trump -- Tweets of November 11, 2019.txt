If Iran is able to turn over to the U.S. kidnapped former FBI Agent Robert A. Levinson who has been missing in Iran for 12 years it would be a very positive step. At the same time upon information & belief Iran is & has been enriching uranium. THAT WOULD BE A VERY BAD STEP!Retweets: 18651Favorites: 74699

The lawyer for the Whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big Impeachment Scam! It should be ended and the Whistleblower his lawyer and Corrupt politician Schiff should be investigared for fraud!Retweets: 19395Favorites: 73181

Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We haven't even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me and read it to all!Retweets: 25456Favorites: 92903

Schiff is giving Republicans NO WITNESSES NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS! It is a totally one sided Witch Hunt. This can't be making the Democrats look good. Such a farce!Retweets: 24372Favorites: 89193

Schiff and the Dems have created this whole thing they reverse engineer it. They've been vowing to impeach for three years. Why should we listen to them? Why should we want to?' @greggutfeld @FoxNewsRetweets: 16747Favorites: 63727

'The President has until September 30th to give this aid to Ukraine. He gets it out on September 11th. 3 weeks before the deadline. So we give our ally aid and Joe Biden is not investigated. Remember that they get the aid and we get nothing in return. The Democrats....Retweets: 15725Favorites: 58186
