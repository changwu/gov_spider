    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Hatch (R) Utah and 8 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2290 and commends the Senate for recognizing the need for a fair and efficient system for providing compensation to individuals harmed by exposure to asbestos. Asbestos-related litigation has clogged the courts, depriving those with injuries of a meaningful remedy and resulting in the bankruptcy of at least 60 companies and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. This legislation will protect the rights of those with asbestos-related injuries and preserve American jobs. Although the Administration has concerns about certain provisions of the bill, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns in order to strengthen and improve this important legislation.
