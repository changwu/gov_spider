    LONDONDERRY, NH - The New Hampshire for Hillary campaign today announced Donald Schwartz as the campaign's HillStar of the Week. Don, a Londonderry resident, regularly participates in phone banking and letter writing on the campaign's behalf.
"This is one of the most important elections in our nation's history," said Schwartz, who has been volunteering for the campaign for over four months. "There is no time to waste. We need a leader who is ready to take charge from day one and I believe that Hillary Clinton is that person.
When he's not at the campaign's headquarters in Manchester, Don works as the Chief Technologist for CADLearning.com in Bedford. He also serves as Vice Chair of the Londonderry Democratic Committee.
"I am very grateful for Don's hard work on behalf of my New Hampshire campaign," said Senator Clinton. "Volunteers like Donald will help make this campaign a success."
Every week, the NH for Hillary campaign will name a HillStar of a week to recognize one volunteer who demonstrates extraordinary commitment and dedication to the campaign. HillStars will be featured on the NH for Hillary webpage at www.hillaryclinton.com/nh .
