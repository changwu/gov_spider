    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and tornadoes beginning on May 1, 2010, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Casey, Lewis, Lincoln, Logan, Metcalfe, Rockcastle, Rowan, and Woodford.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and tornadoes in the counties of Allen, Hart, Lewis, Logan, Metcalfe, Monroe, and Rockcastle.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the entire Commonwealth.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Douglas G. Mayne as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are fully completed.
