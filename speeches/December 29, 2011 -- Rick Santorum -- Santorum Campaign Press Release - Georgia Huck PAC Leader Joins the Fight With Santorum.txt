Verona, PA - Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum has received the endorsement of Georgia State Representative Sam Teasley.
State Representative Teasley said: "Elections are about choices. As Americans, we will choose which direction our country should go, and who we want to lead us. When I consider the candidates running for President, there is one person whose record and whose values stand out: Rick Santorum. Rick has led on the issues that matter most - from welfare reform and a balanced budget amendment, to understanding the value of the family in our culture and protecting innocent life, and to understanding the threats that our nation faces in a complex world. These aren't just campaign slogans for him... he's lived this throughout his time in public life. That is why I am proud to endorse Rick Santorum."
Rick Santorum said: "I am excited to welcome Sam to our growing team. Sam understands the importance of the upcoming election, its implications on our economy and the structure of the foundations of our nation. We share a common goal of returning our nation to a constitutional government, based on the framework our Founders instilled over two-centuries ago. I am looking forward to working with Sam as we build upon our momentum in the early primary states and expand our network of supporters nationwide."
