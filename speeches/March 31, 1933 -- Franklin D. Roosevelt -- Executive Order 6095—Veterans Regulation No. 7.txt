    ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL CARE FOR VETERANS OF ANY WAR
Whereas, Section 6, Title I, of Public No. 2, 73rd Congress, entitled "An Act To maintain the credit of the United States Government" provides:
"In addition to the pensions provided in this title, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs is hereby authorized under such limitations as may be prescribed by the President, and within the limits of existing Veterans' Administration facilities, to furnish to veterans of any war, including the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine Insurrection, domiciliary care where they are suffering with permanent disabilities, tuberculosis or neuropsychiatric ailments and medical and hospital treatment for diseases or injuries."
Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by said law, the following regulation is promulgated:
I. The Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, within the limits of Veterans' Administration facilities, is authorized in his discretion to furnish to honorably discharged veterans of any war, including the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine Insurrection, suffering from diseases or injuries incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active military or naval service, such medical, surgical and dental services as may be found to be reasonably necessary. Such veterans may also be furnished with such supplies including dental appliances, wheel chairs, artificial limbs, trusses, and similar appliances, including special clothing made necessary by the wearing of prosthetic appliances, as the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs may determine to be useful and reasonably necessary, which dental appliances, wheel chairs, artificial limbs, trusses, special clothing, and similar appliances may be procured by the Veterans' Administration in such manner, either by purchase or manufacture, as the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs may determine to be advantageous and reasonably necessary.
