    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Reps. Udall (D) and McCain (R) Arizona)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4216 because it would require the Federal Government to pay $30 million to the Papago Tribe based on the contention that its Reservation has been rendered "unuseable" as a result of flooding attributable*to operation of the Painted Rock Dam by the Corps of Engineers. The Papagos, however, were compensated for any flood damage when the U.S. purchased a flowage easement from the tribe that explicitly permitted flooding of these Reservation lands. Moreover, these lands could be restored to the condition they were in prior to their flooding at a much smaller ($1 to $2 million) cost to the trifee. Successful cotton farming operations are currently underway on similarly situated, previously flooded lands adjacent to the Reservation.
If H.R. 4216 were to be enacted, the President's senior advisors would recommend disapproval.
