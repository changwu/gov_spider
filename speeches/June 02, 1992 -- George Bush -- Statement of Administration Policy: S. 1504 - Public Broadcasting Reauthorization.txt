    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Inouye (D) Hawaii and 7 others)
The Administration opposes S. 1504, which authorizes appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), unless it is amended to address the concerns discussed below.
The Administration strongly supports amendments to:

— Conform to the FY 1993 Budget by: (1) eliminating the authorization of $42 million per year for construction of public telecommunications facilities; and (2) authorizing $275 million rather than $375 million for CPB in FY 1995.
— Increase accountability of public broadcasting through disclosure of information by the CPB and other entities that receive Federal funds for broadcasting.
— Require CPB to take steps to ensure balance and objectivity in its programming.
