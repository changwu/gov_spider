    Sixty-four years ago, the United States became the first country in the world to recognize the State of Israel, the realization of a modern day state in the historic homeland of the Jewish people. Since that momentous day, the special bond of friendship between the United States and Israel has grown stronger. Ours is a unique relationship founded on an unbreakable commitment to Israel's security and anchored by our common interests and deeply held values. These values continue to enlighten and guide our efforts as we work with Israel, as well as with others in the region, to confront shared challenges and to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on a two-state solution that will usher in a future of peace, security, and dignity for the people of Israel and its neighbors.
Today, as Israelis celebrate their 64th Independence Day and their remarkable achievements over the past six decades, it gives me great pleasure to extend my best wishes and the best wishes of the American people to President Peres, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the people of Israel.
