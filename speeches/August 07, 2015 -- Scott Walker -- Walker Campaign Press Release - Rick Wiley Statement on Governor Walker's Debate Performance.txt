    Cleveland, Ohio - Walker for America campaign manager, Rick Wiley, tonight issued the following statement regarding Governor Scott Walker's performance in the Fox News debate:
"Gov. Scott Walker did exactly what he needed to do during tonight's debate. He was unflappable, fluent on the issues and above all, presidential. He delivered a commanding performance, keeping his eye on the GOP's real opponent in this race: Hillary Clinton. Gov. Walker's record of successful reforms in Wisconsin reads like a wish list of conservative policy prescriptions. It is unmatched in the field of 2016 hopefuls, and as Gov. Walker continues to introduce himself to Americans during debates and on the campaign trail, support for him and his brand of bold, successful conservative reforms will only grow."
