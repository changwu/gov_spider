    I AM sending to the Congress today the Bicentennial Land Heritage Act. This proposal will more than double the present acreage of land for national parks, recreation areas, and wildlife sanctuaries. It will provide funds for the development of these new lands to make them accessible and enjoyable.
It will enable us to improve facilities and to increase dedicated personnel at existing national parks. It will make available $200 million for urban parks, bringing the benefits of nature to those who live in our communities. And it will accelerate the development of parklands and sanctuaries now delayed for lack of manpower and of money.
This national commitment is one of the soundest investments in the future of America. We must act now to prevent the loss of treasures that can never be replaced for ourselves, for our children, and for the generations in the future.
