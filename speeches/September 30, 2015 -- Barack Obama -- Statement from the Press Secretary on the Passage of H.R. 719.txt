    With today's bipartisan vote, Congress has taken a step away from the brink â€“ and the President will sign the bill into law once he receives it. But, the American people deserve far better than last-minute, short-term legislating. That's why Congress should pass a budget that reverses harmful spending cuts known as sequestration to allow for critical investments in our military readiness, infrastructure, schools, public health, and R&D that keep our companies on the cutting edge. Congress can and should get this work done without delay. There is no reason that we should deny American families and businesses the certainty and support they need by kicking the can down the road again. At a time when our businesses have created more than 13 million new jobs over the past five and a half years, Washington can choose to support our American comeback or to stall its momentum. To the President, the choice is clear.
