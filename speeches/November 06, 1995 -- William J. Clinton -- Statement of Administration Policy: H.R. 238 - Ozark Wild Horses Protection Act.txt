    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Emerson (R) MO and two cosponsors)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 238. The bill would impose unnecessary and unduly restrictive limits on the management of untamed horses in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways in Missouri. These restrictions would conflict with the National Park Service's ability to manage the park to achieve its original purposes to conserve natural resource values along two rivers and the associated riparian areas.
