    Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend, John Davis Lodge. His death is not only a personal loss to those of us who trusted in his friendship and advice but to the country he served so patriotically throughout his long and full life.
John was a man of great and varied talents who excelled in each of his chosen occupations. We will never forget the young lawyer-cum-movie star who acted in such film classics as "Little Women" and "The Scarlet Empress" and who continued his acting career on the stage. But we shall always be most grateful to John Davis Lodge, the able public servant. As a Congressman and Governor of Connecticut, Ambassador to Spain, Argentina, and Switzerland, and in many other important positions, John was a tireless fighter against communism and a constant friend of freedom, both at home and abroad. At the time of his death, John was still serving his nation and the cause of humanity as a delegate to the United Nations. He will be sorely missed by his friends and by the country to which he gave such a full measure of his devotion.
On behalf of all Americans, Nancy and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Lodge family.
