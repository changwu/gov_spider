    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 20 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of the H.R. 5567, the "International Narcotics Control Act of 1990." Although H.R. 5567 includes waivers needed to provide assistance to the Andean countries, it restricts the President's ability to implement his international cocaine control strategy through the Andean Initiative. The bill does not authorize sufficient appropriations for the President's Andean Initiative. It also imposes cumbersome Presidential determinations and reporting requirements and unrealistic timetables on achieving program goals. In addition, H.R. 5567 continues to require the United States to retain title to virtually all aircraft provided to Andean countries for drug control purposes, which undermines the Administration's ability to implement optimally the military assistance program.
