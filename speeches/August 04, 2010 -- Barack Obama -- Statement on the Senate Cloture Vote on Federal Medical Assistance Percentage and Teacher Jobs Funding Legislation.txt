    Today Congress took an important step towards ensuring that teachers across the country can stay in the classroom and cash-strapped States can get the relief they need.
We know that economic prosperity and educational success go hand in hand. That's why I'm urging the Senate to pass this legislation that will prevent local budget cuts and save thousands of teacher jobs across the country.
I commend Senator Reid for his hard work and look forward to a final vote later this week.
