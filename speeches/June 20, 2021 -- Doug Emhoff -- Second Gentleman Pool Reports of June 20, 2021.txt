The Rwandan American author Immaculee Ilibagiza was honored by Mr. Houghton as an „outstanding American by choice". She became a citizen a couple of years ago.

But: „There is always hope."„If I can forgive, and I have, everyone can."
Then everyone stood up and spoke the Pledge of Allegiance. After that the 51 candidates came on stage one after the other from the right side, received their certificates and were congratulated by Mr. Emhoff.

SGOTUS pool report #6
Your pooler was able to speak briefly with Ms. Ilibagiza after the event and asked her what Mr. Emhoff said to her. That's her reply: „He said he will never forget my story. He said he was very moved and that it was the perfect timing."
And with that, I conclude my pool duty in New York. Enjoy the rest of this gorgeous day!
