    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"Today's disappointing second-quarter GDP growth is yet another reminder of just how poorly the economy has fared on President Obama's watch. His policies have thus far failed to spur the growth he promised. He can claim that his policies have 'worked,' but the 23 million Americans who are struggling to find work tell a very different story. We need fresh ideas to bring growth back to our economy, and Mitt Romney has them."
