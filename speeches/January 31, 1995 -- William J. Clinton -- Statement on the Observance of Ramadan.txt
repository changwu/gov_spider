    I want to offer my greetings and sincere best wishes on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan.
The crescent moon symbolizes Islam and with the sighting of the crescent which heralds Ramadan millions of Americans will join Muslims around the world in observing this most sacred of times. During the next month, those who follow the Islamic religion will fast and abstain from the normal routines of life in order to better devote themselves to understanding and following their faith. It is a time not just for inward reflection but for rededication to the needs of the wider community and the requirement of service to others.
At this time of spiritual peace, when recognition of the ties which bind people of good will is paramount, it is fitting to recall the strides which have been taken to bring peace to the Middle East. As enemies reconcile and dialog replaces confrontation, this is a time for reflection on the hopes and dreams of a better life and a better world shared by those of all faiths.
Let us take pride in what has been accomplished toward realization of this noble vision. But for the sake of our children—our future— let us all renew our determination and work to make this moment of peace a lasting testament to a more peaceful world for all.
