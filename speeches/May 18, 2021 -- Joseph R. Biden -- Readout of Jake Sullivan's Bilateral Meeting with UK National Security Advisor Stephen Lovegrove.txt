    Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met in Washington with Stephen Lovegrove, National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to exchange views on a range of shared global challenges as part of our ongoing bilateral consultations. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Lovegrove agreed to continue coordinating on COVID-19, including global access to vaccines. They discussed Afghanistan, Russia, and Iran, as well as the situation in Gaza. In addition, they discussed President Biden's June trip to the United Kingdom to attend the G7 Summit and meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which will provide an opportunity to reaffirm our strong alliance.
