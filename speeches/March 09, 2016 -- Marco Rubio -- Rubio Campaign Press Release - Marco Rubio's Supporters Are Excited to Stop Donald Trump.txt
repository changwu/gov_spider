Marco drew big crowds yesterday in stops in Sarasota and Nocatee, Florida. Check out this front page story from the Bradenton Herald:

FOX 4 covered Marco's event in Sarasota, where an excited crowd greeted their home state Senator:

Marco's Florida supporters are fired up to help him stop Donald Trump six days from now:
"Who I am and what I stand for is the opposite of Donald Trump," said 20-year-old Florida State University junior Letty Burgin, who has sacrificed this week's spring break to help save Rubio's campaign. "Even if he's the underdog, and even if he's supposed to lose," Burgin said of Rubio while knocking on doors in a Tampa-area neighborhood on Tuesday, "I will give everything I have."
Later in Nocatee, Marco greeted another large crowd ready to help deliver a win on March 15th:

The St. Augustine Record also covered the rally above the fold.

WLTV News said Marco was "electrifying":
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took the stage to the tune of AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck' at a Nocatee campaign rally Tuesday, electrifying the crowd as he vowed to beat Hillary Clinton in November and reverse "all of the damage Barack Obama has done."
Marco has been an underdog in Florida and won before. Voting has already begun, so make sure to cast your vote for Marco!
