    President Trump. Well, it's great to have Prime Minister Hariri with us. We have watched the tremendous progress made in Lebanon. It's not easy. It's not easy. But he's fighting many fronts, and they've really developed great relationships with our representatives and with me. And, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you in the Oval Office.
Prime Minister Hariri. Thank you. It's an honor to be here with you, Mr. President. And also, we're happy to make sure that this partnership that we have with fighting ISIS and all terrorism is ongoing. And we'll keep our partnership, hopefully, for the best of the region. And I hope that in our talk we will have much more—you know, much more talk about this—these issues.
President Trump. We will. We will. Thank you all very much.
