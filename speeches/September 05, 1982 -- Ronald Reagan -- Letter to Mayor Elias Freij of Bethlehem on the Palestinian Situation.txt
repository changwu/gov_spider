    Mr. Mayor:
I wish to express to you my deepest gratitude for your message of support for the proposals which I outlined in my address on September 1. It is particularly important to have your endorsement of my approach to peace. You are not only a recognized and respected Palestinian leader, but you represent Bethlehem which has been a glowing symbol of peace and brotherhood throughout the world for the past two thousand years. May God bless you and your efforts on behalf of your people and peace and security for all in the region.
RONALD REAGAN
I wish to convey to you, Mr. President, from the little town of Bethlehem, our support for your plan to find a comprehensive solution to end the sufferings of the Palestinian people and to bring peace and security for all nations in the Middle East. Please be assured of our sincere desire for peace with freedom and for peace with a homeland. May God give you the strength and wisdom to fulfill our expectations.
ELIAS FREIJ Mayor of Bethlehem
