    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Chu, D-CA, and 214 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021.
Texas recently enacted S.B. 8, an extreme law that blatantly violates existing Supreme Court precedent established under Roe v. Wade nearly half a century ago. The Texas law significantly impairs women's access to critical reproductive health care, particularly affecting communities of color, individuals with low incomes, and those who live in rural or underserved communities. The law also turns private citizens into bounty hunters who are empowered to bring lawsuits against anyone who they believe has helped another person get an abortion, including family members, faith leaders, those providing transportation, and health care providers.
In the wake of Texas' unprecedented attack, it has never been more important to codify this constitutional right and to strengthen health care access for all women, regardless of where they live. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress as the Women's Health Protection Act advances through the legislative process to ensure that this bill codifies and is consistent with the protections established by Roe and subsequent Supreme Court precedent.
The constitutional rights of women are essential to the health, safety, and progress of our nation. Our daughters and granddaughters deserve the same rights that their mothers and grandmothers fought for and wonâ€”and that a clear majority of the American people support. We will not allow this country to go backwards on women's equality.
