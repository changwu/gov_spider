    Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush made the following statement on tonight's vice-presidential debate:
"Paul Ryan won the debate tonight because he articulated a better future under a Romney Administration — one marked by more economic freedom, 12 million new jobs and a stronger middle class. I'm confident Americans want to restore our freedoms, reaffirm our founding principles and return the promise of more prosperity and more opportunity achievable under a thriving free market economy. That's the America we can have with a Romney-Ryan administration."
