    Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure to upgrade our public schools with modern, clean, energy efficient facilities and transportation. The Action Plan activates the entire federal government in leveraging Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan investments to deliver health and learning benefits to children and school communities, save school districts money, and create good union jobs. It provides tools and funding that schools, school districts, states and local communities can all use to work together to address this critical challenge.
As part of the Action Plan, the Department of Energy launched a new $500 million grant program through President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make public schools more energy efficient and save schools money. This new program will lower energy costs, improve air quality, and prioritize schools most in need, enabling schools to focus more resources on student learning.
Here's what they are saying:
Members of Congress
Delaware Senator Tom Carper, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works: "No parent should worry about the quality of air their child is breathing in school — whether in the classroom or on a school bus. That's why I am delighted to see the Biden-Harris Administration taking action to reduce harmful pollution in our schools and improve the health of our students and teachers. Today's announcement will help our nation's schools access the historic funding that Congress has provided for air quality monitoring, clean school buildings, and clean transportation provided in the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We fought for these investments to deliver better educational experiences for students across our country — especially those in historically underserved communities that have long carried the burden of high pollution." [Statement, 4/4/22]

Beneficial Electrification League: "BEL was honored to be with Vice-President Harris and Secretary Granholm for a special event that took place at Thomas Elementary Achool in Washington, DC. In her remarks introducing an initiative to "upgrade our public schools with modern, clean, energy efficient facilities and transportation," the Vice President pointed to the importance of school buses, which represent the nation's largest form of public transportation. The takeaway for BEL? The benefits of electric school buses are scalable. We hope to help provide access to the funding for rural areas and others local communities who can use the money saved by switching to electric to meet other school and educational needs."

This whole-of-government approach to school infrastructure will help ensure kids in schools breathe cleaner air while saving districts money and creating good-paying jobs. More than 25 million children ride dirty diesel-powered school buses each day, and programs like the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure will help schools better access the resources they need to make sure that kids have a clean ride to school. We also urge Congress to swiftly approve President Biden's FY2023 Budget and enact the House-passed $555 billion investments in climate, jobs and justice investments to make our schools even safer and healthier."

Johanna Neumann, Senior Director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, Environment America: "Equipping America's schools with cleaner, more efficient energy technologies will reduce pollution, improve health and lower operating costs. By making sure that schools have access to clean renewable energy, we can help ensure a better future for all of us. Schools with cutting-edge energy technologies can set an example in communities across America and help educate the next generation about steps we can take to clean up our air and preserve a healthy climate. Energy efficiency upgrades for our schools even have the added bonus of helping reduce these institutions' energy costs, meaning more precious education dollars can go toward teaching our kids rather than heating or cooling drafty buildings. Less pollution, healthier kids and better education outcomes. What's not to like? It's great to see the Biden administration advance this kind of win-win-win that communities across the country can tap into and reap tangible local benefits." [Statement, 4/4/22]

The Electric School Bus Initiative: "NEWS: The @WhiteHouse just announced an action plan for upgrading U.S. public school facilities and transportation with clean, modern and efficient energy infrastructure, — with a focus on #ElectricSchoolBuses. Here's why it matters. Students need a safe educational environment to thrive. But diesel school buses release harmful fumes with proven links to serious physical health issues and cognitive development impacts. In fact, diesel exhaust is so dangerous, the @WHOhas labeled it a known carcinogen. Air pollution is also an issue of equity and environmental justice. Low-income students and communities of color are disproportionately exposed to on-road pollution and diesel school bus exhaust, putting these students at higher risk of its negative impacts. We are deeply encouraged to see this administration focusing on the importance of a #CleanRide4Kids as part of a holistic approach to cleaner American public schools. Now it's time to put this plan into action and deliver an equitable transition to #ElectricSchoolBuses." [Tweet, 4/4/22]
The School Superintendents Association: "The formation of the Collaborative coincides with the announcement of the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure.

Gary LaBarbera, President, Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York: "New York City students deserve the best – the best education, educators, and facilities. That's why investment in carbon-free and healthy schools is a critical component of any forward-looking infrastructure plan. Installing energy-efficient retrofits and solar power across New York City's public school system will save tens of thousands of tons of carbon emissions annually, create thousands of good, union family-sustaining construction jobs in the process, and keep schools healthier and safer for students.

That's why we're organizing to win carbon-free and healthy schools in our community. We know that investing in climate-friendly schools can reduce local air pollution, make our schools healthier and safer, and create pathways to lifelong union careers right here in our neighborhoods. With the Biden administration's leadership on schools and a huge amount of federal funding available for school buildings and electric school buses, this is our chance to take on the climate crisis and build state-of-the-art public schools right here in Bridgeport."

Rick Levy, President, Texas AFL-CIO: ""Climate change is a real issue for public school students and communities across Texas. From school evacuations and floods during Hurricane Harvey to heat waves that make classrooms too hot to learn, our outdated school facilities aren't ready for the climate crisis. The Texas Climate Jobs Project, a coalition of Texas unions united to advance a pro-worker and pro-climate agenda that works for all Texans, believes that every student, teacher, and community in Texas deserves a healthy, state-of-the-art public school. It's time to invest in carbon-free and healthy schools and buses that keep our kids safe and protect our planet. With federal infrastructure funding, we can create healthier classrooms for students and educators, slash carbon emissions and local air pollution, create union jobs in our communities, and save school districts money on energy costs."
