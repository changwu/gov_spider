    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today filed official paperwork to place the Mayor on the ballot for the Oklahoma Republican Primary. National Women for Rudy Chair Terry Neese of Oklahoma City filed on Rudy's behalf.
"Rudy is the only Republican that can win in the general election," said Neese. "He is the strong leader we need to keep America on the offense in the Terrorists' War on Us, while pursuing conservative fiscal policies that grow our economy. Oklahomans can trust that Rudy will get results because he has a record of getting results."
Neese also serves as the Oklahoma Finance Chair for the Giuliani Campaign.
