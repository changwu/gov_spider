    Mrs. Ellsworth, Governor Anderson, distinguished guests, members and friends of the United States Air Force:
We are met here in tribute to a gallant and patriotic America, a man whose name will always be an inspiration to the members of his family and his loved ones, his friends, to the members of his garrison, to all the Armed Services, and to Americas everywhere.
It is now my very great honor to dedicate this great base in memory of Brigadier General Richard Ellsworth.
