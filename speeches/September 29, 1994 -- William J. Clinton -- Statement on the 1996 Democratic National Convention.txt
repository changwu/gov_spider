    I am pleased with Chairman Wilhelm's decision to name Debra DeLee to head the 1996 Democratic National Convention. I am confident her energy and enthusiasm as well as her political expertise will make the 1996 convention an exciting and rewarding experience for those inside the convention hall, throughout Chicago, and across America.
