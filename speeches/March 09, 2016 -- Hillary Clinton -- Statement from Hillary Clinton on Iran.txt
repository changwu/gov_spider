    Hillary Clinton released the following statement on Wednesday regarding new reports of Iranian missile tests and the nine year anniversary of Robert Levinson's disappearance:
I am deeply concerned by reports that Iran has tested multiple missiles, which it claimed were stamped with words declaring that "Israel should be wiped from the pages of history." Â This rhetoric is repulsive and has no place in the community of nations, and as President I will continue to stand with Israel against such threats. This demonstrates once again why we need to address Iran's destabilizing activities across the region, while vigorously enforcing the nuclear deal. These missile launches constitute a blatant violation of Iran's UN Security Council obligations, and such violations must have consequences. Iran should face sanctions for these activities, and the international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats toward Israel will not be tolerated.We also need to hold Iran to its promise to help us locate and bring home Robert Levinson - who disappeared nine years ago today. We cannot rest until he is reunited with his family.
