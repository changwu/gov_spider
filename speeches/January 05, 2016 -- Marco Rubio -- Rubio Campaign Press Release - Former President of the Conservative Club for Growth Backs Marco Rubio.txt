The Club for Growth has been a key player in conservative and Tea Party efforts to buck the establishment over the past several years.
Proud to endorse @marcorubio

Chris Chocola was president of the group from 2009 to 2014, and now he's found his candidate for 2016: It's Marco Rubio.
Here's what he had to say:
I am proud to support Marco Rubio, a strong fiscal conservative and living testament to the American Dream.
The son of a bartender and a maid, Marco has seen firsthand how American families and workers can thrive when the shackles of government are removed. Washington's pattern of borrowing and spending its way out of problems has failed to expand opportunity for working families, preventing many parents from providing their children with a better future as Marco's parents did for him. Marco is committed to expanding jobs and opportunity for all Americans, and he has successfully chipped away at Obamacare and consistently fought back against burdensome regulations that are crippling businesses from hiring more workers and increasing wages. Under Marco's leadership, all American families will know that their best days lie ahead.
Chris himself has a decorated career of fighting for conservative, pro-growth policies as a former congressman from Indiana.
The Club backed Marco's insurgent candidacy against party elites in 2009, and Marco earned his support this time around by living up to the principles on which he campaigned.
Rubio bags the endorsement of Club for Growth's former president, Chris Chocola. The current regime likes him too.

Chris joins a growing team of insurgent, forward-thinking conservatives who are adding to Team Marco's momentum.
