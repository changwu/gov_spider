    My Dear Lou:
I have just read your letter.
It is clear to me that in writing it you have been actuated by motives of the highest patriotism, and I salute you. In the terribly regrettable circumstances which have arisen, I feel that I must concur in your judgment and accept your proffered resignation as Secretary of Defense, effective at the close of business on September 19, 1950.
The manner in which you have carried out the purposes of the National Security Act testifies to your high administrative skill and your devotion to the public welfare. The success of your efforts toward the unification of our armed services should be an abiding satisfaction to you, as it is to me. The country is in debt to you for your pioneering achievement in a field fraught with the greatest difficulties. Thanks in great part to your efforts, we build our national defense of the future on a solid foundation.
Your recommendation of General Marshall as your successor betokens the same spirit of patriotism as the rest of your letter. I shall propose at once the legislation necessary to make it effective.
I shall feel free to continue to call upon you for advice.
With my warm personal regards, my thanks again for your distinguished services, and my best wishes, I am
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Louis Johnson, The Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C.]
