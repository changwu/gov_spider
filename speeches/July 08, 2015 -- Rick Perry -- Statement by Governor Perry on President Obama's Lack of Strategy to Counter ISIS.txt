    Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement in response to reports the U.S. is training a stunningly low amount of Syrian rebel fighters to battle ISIS:
AUSTIN — "Ten months ago, President Obama told the American people he would degrade and destroy ISIS. At the time, I questioned his conception of what the U.S. military's role should be in this fight, and whether he had matched ends and means.  It is now clear that the president has not even fully implemented his own strategy. ISIS is no longer just a terrorist group seeking to disrupt peace and stability. It is a terrorist army that is intent on holding the ground it has captured, and establishing a long term Caliphate that inspires thousands of followers abroad. President Obama's strategy to degrade and destroy ISIS should treat it as such."
