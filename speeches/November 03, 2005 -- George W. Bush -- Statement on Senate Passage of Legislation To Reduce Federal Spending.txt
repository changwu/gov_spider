    Today the Senate took an important step forward in cutting the deficit. I commend Senate leadership and the other Senators who supported this spending reduction legislation, and I congratulate Senator Gregg on its successful passage. Congress needs to send me a spending reduction package this year to keep us on track to cutting the deficit in half by 2009.
