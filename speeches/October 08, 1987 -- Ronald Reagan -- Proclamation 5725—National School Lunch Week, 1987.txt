  A Proclamation

The National School Lunch Program was founded 41 years ago. Through it the Federal government works with State governments and local communities to provide food assistance each day for more than 20 million students in 90,000 schools. During National School Lunch Week the American people take time to salute this program and the hardworking citizens whose participation makes it so effective.
This successful program is constantly improving. For instance, food service managers have reached out to the community to involve parents and have promoted good management practices. Many school cafeterias offer new choices such as salad bars to make the lunch period more enjoyable for students. The National School Lunch Program represents the cooperative efforts of parents, teachers, community leaders, and food service specialists in behalf of the students of our Nation, and that is good reason for all of us to celebrate.
By joint resolution approved October 9, 1962, the Congress designated the week beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as "National School Lunch Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 11, 1987, as National School Lunch Week, and I call upon all Americans to give special and deserved recognition to those people at the State and local level whose dedication and innovation contribute so much to the success of the school lunch program.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.

RONALD REAGAN
