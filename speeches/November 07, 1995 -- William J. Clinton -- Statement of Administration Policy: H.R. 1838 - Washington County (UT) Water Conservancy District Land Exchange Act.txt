    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Hansen (R) UT)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 1838 because the bill is unnecessary and may delay, rather than expedite, the proposed land exchange.
The Department of the Interior fully supports the exchange, and is now implementing it administratively. The bill, however, could delay this exchange by imposing inflexible deadlines, waiving certain statutorily required analyses related to the transfer, and incorrectly describing Federal lands. Moreover, H.R. 1838 could adversely affect pending litigation involving a portion of the Federal lands.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring 
H.R. 1838 would reduce receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill indicates that its enactment would increase the deficit by less than $500,000 during FYs 1997-2001. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
