    Dear Mr. Feinsinger:
On the basis of the information and advice submitted to me by the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, I am of the opinion that the dispute between the Douglas Aircraft Company, Long Beach, California, and the United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (C.I.O.), is of a character which substantially threatens the progress of national defense. Thus, in accordance with the terms of E.O. 10233, I am referring the dispute to the Wage Stabilization Board and asking that the Board investigate and inquire into the issues in dispute and promptly report to me with its recommendations to the parties as to fair and equitable terms of settlement.
The Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization has reported to me on the serious effect of the strike on the production of C-124 transports. The Douglas Company is the sole producer of the C-124 transport and the Air Force has no other type which is capable of performing the mission of this aircraft. It was the C-124 which recently accomplished the evacuation from Korea of 127 wounded in a single flight. Air Force operations are already being seriously impaired by the loss of production. Continuance of the stoppage would mean loss of more planes and impose an even more serious disadvantage on the Air Force.
The report of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service indicates that negotiations to date have been unsuccessful and that, although full use has been made of mediation and conciliation facilities, the strike persists and is likely to persist.
I am asking the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to provide the Board with a record of the issues in dispute.
It is my earnest hope that the men involved will comply with your request that they return to work while the matter is before the Board and that the utilization of the Board's machinery will thus serve its purpose of restoring to production the facilities necessary to the national defense. I am sure that, in that event, the Board will proceed promptly in its task of recommending to the parties fair and equitable terms of settlement of the dispute.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Dear Mr. Feinsinger:
On the basis of the information and advice submitted to me by the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, I am of the opinion that the dispute between the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, Woodridge, New Jersey, and the United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (C.I.O.), is of a character which substantially threatens the progress of national defense. Thus, in accordance with the terms of E.O. 10233, I am referring the dispute to the Wage Stabilization Board and asking that the Board investigate and inquire into the issues in dispute and promptly report to me with its recommendations to the parties as to fair and equitable terms of settlement.
The Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization has reported to me on the serious effect of the strike on the production of jet and reciprocating engines. Even before the strike, engine deliveries from the plant were behind schedule. Since the Wright Aeronautical Corporation is the sole source of supply for the type of engines it produces, the stoppage is having a serious impact on the progress of the defense program.
The report of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service indicates that negotiations to date have been unsuccessful and that, although full use has been made of mediation and conciliation facilities, the strike persists and is likely to persist.
I am asking the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to provide the Board with a record of the issues in dispute.
