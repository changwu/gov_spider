    FOR MORE than three decades, Peter Lisagor covered the newsbeats of the world. His reporting spanned the globe from Vietnam to Suez and from the United Nations to the White House.
His coverage and commentary gained for him the admiration of his colleagues and the respect of those he wrote about. He was a journalist in every sense of the term, fair and thorough. But most of all, Peter will be remembered by his many friends as a gentleman of warmth and wit. I am proud to be counted among Peter's friends.
Betty and I extend our deepest sympathy to his family. He will be missed.
