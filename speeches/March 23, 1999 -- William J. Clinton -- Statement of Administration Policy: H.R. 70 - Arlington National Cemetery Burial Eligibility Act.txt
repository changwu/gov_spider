    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Stump (R) AZ and 115 cosponsors)
The Administration supports the objectives and goals of H.R. 70, which would codify and tighten eligibility requirements for burial in Arlington National Cemetery. The Administration, however, has concerns with the lack of discretionary authority to allow for the burial of individuals who have made extraordinary contributions on behalf of the Armed Forces or the Nation. The Administration will work with Congress to amend the legislation to provide for an appropriate process to allow for such waivers consistent with the sanctity of Arlington National Cemetery.
