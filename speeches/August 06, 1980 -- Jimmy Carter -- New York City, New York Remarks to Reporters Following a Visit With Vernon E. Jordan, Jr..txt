    I just have a word to say about my brief visit with Vernon Jordan. I repeated my promise to him that I would be the last politician to visit him this week, and he's now going to get more rest.
I had a good talk with his doctors. They gave me a fine report on Vernon's recovery, the progress that he has made. And they expect, within a reasonable and predictable period of time, that Vernon will be released from the hospital completely cured.
We had a long talk about our past relationships. We've been personal friends for many years. And I told Vernon that at the time of his injury, the attack on him, that the entire Nation was concerned about his health, not just for what it meant to him personally but for what his life has meant to this country in the past and what it can mean in the future.
So, he's in very good spirits, and he's recovering well. And I'm very proud of what Vernon's life has meant, not only in the Urban League but for all those in this country who believe in justice and truth and progress and an end to hatred and an end to discrimination.
Thank you very much.
