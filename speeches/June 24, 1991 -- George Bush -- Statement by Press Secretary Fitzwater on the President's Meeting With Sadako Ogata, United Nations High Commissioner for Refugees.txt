    President Bush met today with Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). They discussed refugee issues worldwide, with special emphasis on the Horn of Africa and the situation in Iraq. They agreed on the importance of a rapid and comprehensive response to humanitarian emergencies. The President underscored the strong and continuing U.S. support for UNHCR and wished Mrs. Ogata well in her new position as High Commissioner.
The United States will contribute immediately an additional $5 million in refugee program funds to meet the emergency needs of refugees and displaced persons in the Horn of Africa. This brings total U.S. support for refugee assistance activities in the Horn of Africa for fiscal year 1991 to $51.3 million, including recent provision of $18 million in Food for Peace food and 3.6 million Meals Ready to Eat (MRE's) valued at $15.3 million.
The United States is prepared to provide additional assistance as may be required.
