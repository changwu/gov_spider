    We're coming down the stretch, and I feel great. Thank you for asking. [Laughter] This is a seven-stop day, because I want to continue telling the people what I intend to do to protect them and how I intend to put policies in place to make sure America is a hopeful place. I'm looking forward to the day. I really am. I'm excited by the size of the crowds. I'm energized by the support that I have received across this country. It's an opportunity to thank people who have worked so hard on behalf of my candidacy and to tell them how grateful I am for all of the sacrifices they have made on behalf of their country. It's also a chance to remind them that when they work hard, that I'm confident we're going to win.
I want to thank you all for working so hard coming down the stretch. I know you're tired, but look at it this way: It's like that marathoner, Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News]; that finish line is in sight. And I just want to assure you, I've got the energy, the optimism, and the enthusiasm to cross the line.
But thank you all. We'll see you during the course of what's going to be a great day. Thanks.
