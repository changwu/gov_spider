"He's a staunch conservative," said Kimball. "I'm pro-life, he's pro-life. I'm very staunch pro-Second Amendment, as he is. He's a strong fiscal conservative and he's very strong on defense and as a prior military guy, that's important to me."
Kimball said Gingrich "is the only person running who has really been involved in balancing the federal budget, eliminating a $400 billion deficit. He has done it and lived it and he knows how to get it done."
Kimball cited Gingrich's key role as House speaker in reforming the welfare system, and said, "I firmly believe he'll do it again.
"He knows how to create an environment where the private sector can flourish," said Kimball. He cited Gingrich's proposals to eliminate the capital gains tax, cut the corporate income tax to 12.5 percent and allow 100 percent expensing of new equipment, "which for a businessman like me is huge."
Kimball also cited Gingrich's support for cutting regulations and repealing the Obama health care program and the Dodd-Frank law.
"I want the free market back in earnest," said Kimball. "I want to see the EPA go away and replaced with a solutions agency that would be more business-friendly."
