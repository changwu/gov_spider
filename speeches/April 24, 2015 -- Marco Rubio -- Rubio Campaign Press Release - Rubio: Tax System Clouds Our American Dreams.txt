While working long hours in his job as a banquet bartender, my father found motivation in the idea that his efforts would give my siblings and me the chance at a life better than his own. He knew every dollar he brought home would go toward providing a happier childhood and a better future for his children. For him, we were the "why" of his work.
I believe every American has a "why" for the work they do each day. Every one of us can point to something — or someone — and say: that is why I get up each morning to tend this bar, or staff this reception desk, or work the floor of this factory. These motivators form the basis of our American Dreams.
As much as these dreams vary from person to person, we can all agree that funding a growing government is not our primary reason for working hard. But this Friday, as we mark Tax Freedom Day, we have a jarring illustration of just how much time we spend working to finance government rather than our own dreams.
Tax Freedom Day is the first day of the year people have earned enough to pay their full annual tax burden. As of Friday, Americans have earned a combined $4.8 trillion in income since January 1st — the exact amount of state, local and federal taxes we will owe for 2015.
