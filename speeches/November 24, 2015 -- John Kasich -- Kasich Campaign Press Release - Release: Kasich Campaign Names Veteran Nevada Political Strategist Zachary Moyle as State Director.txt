The former Executive Director of the Nevada Republican Party brings vast experience, understanding of Nevada politics to Team Kasich
Today, the Kasich for America campaign announced that it has brought aboard veteran Nevada political strategist Zachary Moyle as State Director of the Kasich Nevada operation.
Zachary Moyle is an experienced political operative with a strong management background in all aspects of campaigns, including media relations, issue advocacy, and grassroots strategy, and has held senior political positions over the last eight years. Since 2004, Moyle has worked closely with a number high profile political organizations and campaigns, most notably serving as Executive Director of the Nevada Republican Party where he helped engineer Nevada's early caucus during the 2008 Presidential campaign, and for the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2010. Moyle is a former consultant for the American Conservative Union and is a past state director for Americans for Prosperity.
"I have been a great admirer for sometime of the work the Governor has done in Ohio and his rational, conservative approach to the problems facing America today," said Moyle. "In a crowded Presidential field, Governor Kasich's resume speaks for itself. He is someone that can stand on a proven record of results and I look forward to advancing his vision for America here in Nevada."
Said Kasich for America campaign manager Beth Hansen, "We will be running a 50 state campaign, and Zac will be instrumental in helping to operationalize our current team of supporters in the state. Nevada is an early and important state, and Zac understands what it takes to be successful there."
