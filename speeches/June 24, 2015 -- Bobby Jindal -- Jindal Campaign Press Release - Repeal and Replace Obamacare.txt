    President Obama's grand program has failed to deliverÂ real healthcare outcomes that America needs. I am the only presidential candidate who has a detailed plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with a conservative and effective alternative. We must empower patients rather than bureaucrats. My healthcare plan focuses on patient freedom and reducing costs. Sign the petition if you believe we can repeal and replace Obamacare.
