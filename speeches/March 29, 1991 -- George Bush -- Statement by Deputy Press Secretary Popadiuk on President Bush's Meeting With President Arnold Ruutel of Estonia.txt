    President Bush met this morning in the Oval Office with Arnold Ruutel, President of Estonia. President Bush began the meeting by reiterating the unequivocal support of the U.S. for Estonia's right to self-determination. He expressed his outrage over the use of force in Vilnius and Riga in January, and he emphasized his conviction that the only solution to this situation was good-faith negotiations between the Baltic States and Moscow. He assured President Ruutel that he had personally made this point to President Gorbachev on many occasions. President Bush took note that negotiations had begun between Estonia and Moscow, and he discussed with President Ruutel the results to date.
