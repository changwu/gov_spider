    We have learned tonight that UPS and the Teamsters have reached a tentative settlement in their contract negotiations. I am pleased that the parties negotiated in good faith. Today's agreement represents their hard work and determination to reconcile their differences for the good of the company, its employees, and the customers they serve. The issues that were at the heart of their negotiations are important to our Nation's economic strength and to all Americans.
I want to especially thank my Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, who worked tirelessly with both sides to enable them to reach this tentative agreement.
