    Washington, DC -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined thousands of workers in calling for passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. The bill, cosponsored by Senator Clinton, will strengthen workers' right to organize.
"This is about giving people choices and protecting workers' fundamental rights," said Senator Clinton. "Unions helped to build the middle class in this country. To rebuild our middle class, we need to restore a level playing field for unions and give them a meaningful opportunity to organize for better wages, stronger benefits, and safer working conditions."
The Employee Free Choice Act would level the playing field between workers and employers by:

Permitting workers to form a union through "majority sign-up," a process in which workers present signed authorization cards as demonstration of their choice to belong to a union;
Requiring mediation and arbitration to help employers and employees reach a first contract in a reasonable period of time; and
Strengthening penalties against employers who violate the labor laws.
