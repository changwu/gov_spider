    President Bush. It's my honor to welcome His Highness to America. Bahrain is a close friend of our country. It housed our 5th Fleetâ€”strong allies. He has made a big difference in his own country, been on the leading edge of reform. He believes in human rights and believes in the full participation of the people of his land. And we're really grateful for your leadership. It's such an honor to welcome you here.
Amir Khalifa. Thank you. I am pleased to have this honor today to meet with the President, who has been promising from the day he wanted to be in this job. And I'm sure America will do a great thing and move forward in all fields, for the stability and security, mainly, of my region, the Gulf region.
We have an old relationship that's lasted for more than a hundred-and-something years. And I think we will keep that one. And that's why I'm here, to consult on matters of security, on matters of trade, on matters of development. And I thank the President for his invitation, his kind invitation.
Thank you very much.
