    Hillary Clinton received the endorsement of Congressman C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger today, illustrating her growing support in Maryland.
"I have known and worked with the Clintons for more than 15 years," Ruppersberger said. "Hillary Clinton has proven to be a decisive, strong, focused, and experienced leader. I am confident that Hillary Clinton has the credentials to be an excellent Commander-In-Chief. She has the ability to lead from her first day in the White House."
Ruppersberger serves on the influential House Intelligence and Appropriations Committees, and is a member of the House Democratic leadership. Known for his commitment to America's servicemen and women, Ruppersberger created "Operation Hero Miles" which allows Americans to donate unused frequent flyer miles to military personnel and their families. Prior to his election to Congress, Ruppersberger served eight years as Baltimore County Executive and nine years as a Baltimore County Councilman.
"Dutch has worked tirelessly to provide for our troops and strengthen our nation's security," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support as we take our message of change across Maryland."
Today's endorsement demonstrates Clinton's strength in Maryland, where she's already been endorsed by Senator Barbara Mikulski and Governor Martin O'Malley.
