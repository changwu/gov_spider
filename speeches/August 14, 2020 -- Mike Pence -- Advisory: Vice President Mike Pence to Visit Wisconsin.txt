    On Wednesday, August 19th, Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Darien, Wisconsin. There, the Vice President will deliver remarks on President Donald Trump's strong record of putting the American worker first and implementing America First trade priorities. During President Trump and Vice President Pence's Administration, they have enacted pro-growth policies, which led to an unemployment rate of 3.5% in Wisconsin and created 15,000 manufacturing jobs in the state since 2016. Since the pandemic, 176,000 Wisconsin jobs have been recovered and over 90% of Wisconsin small businesses have safely reopened. Later that evening, the Vice President will return to Washington, D.C.
Additional details about the Vice President's trip are forthcoming.
