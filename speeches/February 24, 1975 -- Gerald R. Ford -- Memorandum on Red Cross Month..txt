    Memorandum /or Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
I HAVE just issued a Proclamation [4352] which designates March as Red Cross Month. It will be a period when each of us should consider the volunteer spirit that prevails in this Nation as typified by the good works of the American Red Cross.
The Red Cross was on the scene last April in 13 of our States after catastrophic tornadoes leveled communities and left thousands homeless. Its volunteers and staff provided fast and open-handed relief to the victims. Similarly, the Red Cross was responsible for providing assistance in thousands of other disaster situations during the year.
When blood is required by the ill and injured, the Red Cross through volunteer donors provides the blood required to save lives to over half of the country's medical facilities.
Millions of us have acquired the skills that save lives in first aid and water safety courses taught by Red Cross volunteers.
And this Nation's veterans and members of our military forces turn to Red Cross volunteers and staff in time of personal and family crisis for help.
In issuing the Proclamation, I suggest that the Federal Government and its employees, including members of our Armed Forces, consider volunteering for service with the Red Cross to help provide the support so necessary to preserve this vital voluntary effort.
