    Today, Governor Christie's campaign was first to file to be on the ballot in Illinois with over 22,000 signatures and a full slate of 108 delegates and alternates from all 18 Congressional Districts.
"I am incredibly grateful for the thousands of hours of work by our volunteers and staff to get us on the ballot in Illinois," said Governor Christie. "Over the next few months, I will continue to work hard to directly engage voters in town hall meetings and along the campaign trail to candidly discuss the tough issues our country faces including, ensuring our national security, facing our looming entitlement crisis and tackling the addiction epidemic."
The campaign submitted 5,000 signatures to place Governor Christie’s name on the statewide ballot, the maximum allowed under state law. In addition, the campaign submitted over 17,000 signatures on behalf of 108 delegates and alternates pledged to support Governor Christie from each of Illinois’ 18 Congressional districts. On March 15, voters across Illinois will cast their votes for Presidential candidates and pledged delegates to attend the Republican National Convention to be held in Cleveland, Ohio, July 18 to 21, 2016. Illinois is widely considered to be the toughest state in the country to gain access to the ballot as a Presidential candidate in terms of signature and delegate requirements.
In addition to Illinois, Governor Christie is already on the ballot in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Wyoming, as well as participating in the US territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
