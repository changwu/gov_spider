    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Young (R) Alaska and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 889, as reported in the House. The continued strength of the Coast Guard is critical to the Nation's homeland security, defense, environmental preservation, and law enforcement efforts.
The Administration would support amendments to: (1) clarify that the President will submit legislative proposals pursuant to the bill only to the extent that he judges them to be necessary and expedient, consistent with the Recommendations Clause of the Constitution; and (2) delete a pilot program that would create a duplicative vessel-tracking system.
