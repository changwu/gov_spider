    New Endorsements Include State Lawmakers and Community Leaders
Before tomorrow's Illinois Primary, more than 60 community leaders and legislators across Illinois endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"I'm proud to endorse Vice President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for President," said Chicago City Clerk Anna Valencia. "It is time to come together, now more than ever, and support the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump. We need unity to win back the White House and Senate if we want to pass policies that support affordable health care and paid leave. Joe Biden is the candidate we need to help build the future we all deserve."
"Time and time again, Donald Trump has turned his back on the American people," said Illinois State Senator Elgie Sims. "From his dedicated service in the U.S. Senate to steering our foreign policy as Vice President, we have seen a clear leader in Joe Biden. I am proud to endorse a compassionate candidate who has proven that he will restore strong, steady leadership to the Oval Office. Illinois and the United States will be better off when Joe Biden is president."
"I can list many reasons why I am proud to support Joe Biden for President, but knowing that he was always the last person in the room when President Obama had a big decision to make is something I cannot emphasize enough," said Former Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias. "The last few years have proven that leadership is sorely missing from the Oval Office. Joe Biden — one of the most compassionate men to have ever entered public service — has the experience, the knowledge, and the character to bring that leadership back, and I will work as hard as I can to see him sworn into office in January 2021."
