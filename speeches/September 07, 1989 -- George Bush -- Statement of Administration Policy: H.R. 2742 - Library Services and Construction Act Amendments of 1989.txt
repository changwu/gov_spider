    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) MT and 12 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2742 because reauthorization of existing Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) programs no longer provide for the most effective allocation of Federal resources for library services. Many of the activities currently supported under the LSCA are well established and successful, and no longer require Federal assistance.
The Administration, instead, supports its proposal, the "Library Services Improvement Act of 1989," which targets resources for library services more effectively. The Administration's proposal would authorize programs to: (1) improve the contribution of libraries to the education of economically disadvantaged or handicapped individuals; (2) increase access to a greater variety of library materials through resource sharing; and (3) support research needed to improve library services.
Unlike the Administration's proposal, H.R. 2742 does not target resources for those most in need of services and does nothing to enhance State accountability for program quality. Also, the bill inappropriately expands the LSCA's existing construction authority.
