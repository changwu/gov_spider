    Laura and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Moakley family. Joe was a fine man. As a veteran and later a Congressman, he served his country and the people of Massachusetts with distinction and honor. He was respected by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle and was known for his candor, wit, and humility. We will miss him.
