    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Young (R) AK, Saxton (R) NJ, and Studds (D) MA)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1141, which would amend the Act popularly known as the "Sikes Act" pertaining to fish and wildlife conservation and natural resources management plans for military installations. The Administration, however, will seek amendments during Senate consideration to clarify that the Secretary of Defense may include in the resource management plans provisions for the sustained use of natural resources on military installations and for certain "nonconsumptive uses" (e.g. recreational uses).
