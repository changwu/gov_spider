    Klobuchar Receives Endorsement of Highest Ranking Latinx Elected Official in Iowa
DES MOINES, IA â€” This weekend, Scott County Recorder Rita Vargas today endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. Vargas, who has served as Scott County Recorder since 2002, is the highest ranking Latinx elected official in the state of Iowa.
"Amy Klobuchar has the right skills, experience, and vision to lead our country right now," said Scott County Recorder Rita Vargas. "She's committed to bringing people together over our shared values, she's crafted bold and achievable policy plans, and she has the track record to get these plans passed through Congress. With Amy as president, the Latinx community will have a leader who will stand up for worker's rights, pass comprehensive immigration reform, achieve affordable health care, and tackle climate change head-on. I am proud to endorse Amy's candidacy today and look forward to caucusing for her on February 3rd."
Vargas, a lifelong resident of Scott County, was first elected to the recorder's office in 2002 and is a member of the Iowa County Recorders Association. Prior to her election she worked in the Davenport district office of U.S. Senator Tom Harkin.
Klobuchar, who has been widely praised for her legislative record in the U.S. Senate, has received endorsements from a large number of local and state elected officials in Iowa. She currently has the support of 13 sitting members of the Iowa legislature -- the most of any candidate in the field. Each time she has led the ticket as a Senate candidate in Minnesota, Democrats have flipped the State House of Representatives from Republican to Democratic control.
