    Good evening. Laura and I welcome you to the White House for what is going to be a very special evening. One of the interesting things about living here is that, on occasion, some of our Nation's finest artists come to perform. Nothing like having great performers in your living room. [Laughter] And tonight we're looking forward to a fantastic performance.
As we gather during African American History Month, tonight we honor the Dance Theatre of Harlem and its unique founder, Arthur Mitchell. America is blessed to have people like Arthur Mitchell in our midst. So, Arthur, thank you for coming; thank you for your care and concern for our Nation's youth; and thank you for being dogged in your determination to see that this program flourishes. And we're glad to be a part of seeing that the program does flourish.
Since its creation in 1969, the company has set a new standard for excellence in dance and has won international acclaim. The Dance Theatre of Harlem School has provided thousands of students the opportunity to study dance, some of whom we'll see tonight. The Dance Theatre's community outreach programs are now bringing arts education to people all across America and around the world.
For almost four decades, the Dance Theatre of Harlem has done a lot to enrich countless lives through its brilliant performances and educational efforts. And so tonight I offer a toast to the achievements and continued success of Arthur Mitchell and the Dance Theatre of Harlem.
