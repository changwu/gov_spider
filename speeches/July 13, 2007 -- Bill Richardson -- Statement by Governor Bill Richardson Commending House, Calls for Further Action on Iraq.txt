    SANTA FE, NM -- Democratic Presidential candidate Governor Bill Richardson released the following statement today on the passage of H.R. 2956, The Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act.
"I commend the House of Representatives for taking action where the President has failed by moving forward on redeploying our troops from Iraq.
"However, the bill passed yesterday does not go far enough. We need to get all of our troops out of Iraq. Every last one. No residual forces. And we must do it as soon as possible. Only then can the hard work of tough diplomacy begin.
"The House has taken a good first step, and now they need to keep working. We cannot be satisfied until all of our troops are out of Iraq."
