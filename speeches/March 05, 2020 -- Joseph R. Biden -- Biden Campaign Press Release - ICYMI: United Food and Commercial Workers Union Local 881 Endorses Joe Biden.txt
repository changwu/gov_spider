    Today, Local 881 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) in Illinois and Northwest Indiana released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Another four years of the Trump Administration would be a disaster for working people. It is critical that our next President be a friend to workers and an advocate for Unions. We believe Joe Biden is the best candidate to help our members and lead our nation. Joe Biden has been an advocate for our Local Union, has a great track record of putting working families first, and is committed to strengthening the rights of Union workers. He has developed a specific plan to help increase unionization, prevent employers from hindering the organizing efforts of workers, and protect collective bargaining rights. We strongly believe that Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat Trump and will provide leadership that puts workers first. We are proud to give him our endorsement." said Steven M. Powell, President of Local 881 and UFCW International Vice President
