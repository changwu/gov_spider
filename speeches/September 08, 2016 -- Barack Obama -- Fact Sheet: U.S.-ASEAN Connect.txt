    Strategic Partners for Sustainable and Innovative Economic Growth
Connect Represents the Next Chapter in the U.S.-ASEAN Economic Relationship
U.S.-ASEAN Connect ("Connect") is the U.S. Government's strategic framework for economic engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Member States. Connect was announced by President Obama on February 15, 2016, at the historic U.S.-ASEAN special Leaders' Summit in Sunnylands, California. Organized around four pillars – Business Connect, Energy Connect, Innovation Connect, and Policy Connect – the initiative provides strategic focus to ongoing and future U.S. economic activities in the region. U.S.-ASEAN Connect brings together all the resources and expertise of the U.S. government and private sector to create a whole-of-U.S. approach to economic engagement in the region. It reflects both the U.S. government and U.S. private sector's desire to support ASEAN's continued integration, including the success of the ASEAN Economic Community, and increased U.S.-ASEAN trade and investment.
Strong economic ties have been at the core of the United States and ASEAN's relationship for the past four decades. ASEAN countries are collectively the United States' fourth-largest goods trading partner. Two-way trade in goods and services has tripled since the 1990s and now supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States and ASEAN. U.S. businesses have more than doubled their foreign direct investment (FDI) in ASEAN, where they have been one of the largest cumulative sources of FDI. U.S. investment in the region not only supports jobs and economic growth – it transfers cutting-edge technology, builds local communities, and strengthens the skill sets of local workers.
Through U.S.-ASEAN Connect, the U.S. Government and private sector will strengthen our partnership with ASEAN, supporting ASEAN's goal of building a dynamic, innovative, sustainable, resilient and rules-based economic community that benefits citizens in all of our countries.
Delivering New High-Impact Programs and Events under Four Pillars
Connect is delivering on the promise of providing a strategic focus to U.S. economic engagement in ASEAN under four pillars: Business Connect, Energy Connect, Innovation Connect, and Policy Connect. New activities under Connect include the following:
Business Connect supports increased commercial engagement between the United States and ASEAN. The United States is establishing an agribusiness credit enhancement program, in partnership with regional financial institutions, to increase access to finance and improve business processes and technologies for small and medium-sized agribusinesses and entrepreneurs in the region. Through a new Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Singapore Ministry of Trade, U.S. and Singaporean firms will work to deliver e-commerce, financial technology, infrastructure, and smart city solutions throughout ASEAN.
Energy Connect helps develop ASEAN's power sector using sustainable, efficient, and innovative technologies. To help deliver on this goal and increase the supply of grid-connected renewable energy, USAID will support a new multi-million dollar, multi-year effort in ASEAN member states through its Clean Power Asia program.
Innovation Connect supports innovation-focused ecosystems that spur invention, create new businesses, promote sustainable growth and assist ASEAN in developing the region's future innovators, entrepreneurs and business leaders. The United States, in partnership with Australia, is providing a guarantee to support the Women's Livelihood Bond, which will leverage just over $15 million in private capital for microfinance institutions that lend to women and social enterprises to create sustainable livelihoods for women. A new Digital Economy Series is being organized around the key issues ASEAN must tackle to build a successful and vibrant regional digital economy. This cross-cutting initiative will feature a series of public-private policy engagements, capacity-building activities, and people-to-people exchanges on e-commerce, digital entrepreneurship, mobile payments, and broadband connectivity, among other topics. The initiative will support ASEAN in developing an open and integrated digital economy that can drive innovation and inclusive economic growth.
Policy Connect works with ASEAN countries to improve the policy and regulatory environment for growth, trade, innovation and investment supporting ASEAN Member States' regional integration objectives under the ASEAN Economic Community. The U.S.-ASEAN Trade Workshops, under the U.S.-ASEAN Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement, will help ASEAN Member State officials familiarize themselves with the elements that go into high-standard trade agreements, helping to improve the environment for trade and investment.
Making a Tangible Commitment
The U.S. government is establishing a U.S.-ASEAN Connect Center led by a new resident Director and new dedicated staff housed within the U.S. Mission to ASEAN in Jakarta. The Center will work closely with strategic Connect locations and with regionally focused staff in Bangkok and Singapore to carry forward the Connect vision. The Connect personnel in these three locations will coordinate closely with the ten bilateral U.S. embassies in the ASEAN member state capitals that will remain the primary points of contact for country-specific issues. The U.S. government is also launching a U.S.-ASEAN Connect web site (www.usaseanconnect.gov) to facilitate access to the wide variety of expertise and resources the United States has to offer.
Taking a "Whole-of-Government" Approach to Partnership under U.S.-ASEAN Connect
Effective economic engagement requires coordination to utilize the wide variety of expertise and resources the United States has to offer. The U.S. government is collaborating across the wide range of departments and agencies and is deepening cooperation with the U.S. private sector to deliver programming, events, and assistance to promote inclusive economic growth and encourage improvements in the rule of law and the business climate. Examples of the comprehensive support the United States has been providing in the region include:

U.S. Department of the Treasury 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury has contributed to both the Policy Connect and Energy Connect pillars by engaging in bilateral and multilateral discussions with ASEAN partners on economic, financial and infrastructure development issues and by providing support from the Office of Technical Assistance (OTA).
