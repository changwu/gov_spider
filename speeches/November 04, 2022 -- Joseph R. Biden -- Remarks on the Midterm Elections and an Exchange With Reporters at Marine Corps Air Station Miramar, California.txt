    The President. I know you always asked me, "How are we doing?" We're going to win this time around, I think. I feel really good about our chances. I haven't been in all the House races, but I think we're going to keep the Senate and pick up a seat. I think we have a chance to win in the House. I don't think we're going—not "win," keeping the House.
So I'm optimistic. I really am. And I find that, you know, most of the debate that occurs in the places I visit—I know you don't think it, but I think we have pretty good crowds. They're fairly enthusiastic. You don't write it that way, but they are.
And I find that the thing that gives me the most confidence is the fact that the policies we've initiated, people care about. Now, they want more. They write to me, but I don't know anybody who's really opposed to us bringing down medical prices and prescription drugs and all those other things.
So I feel optimistic.
And you can smile. I'm okay. All right?
