    Today, we saw a profile in courage. Leo Purcell, president of the Massachusetts Building Trades Council, endorsed NAFTA in a letter to fellow union workers.
In addition to saying, as I have, that this is a choice between change and status quo, Purcell wrote, "No longer can nations afford to build invisible walls at their borders because there are no longer national borders to free trade."
I applaud Mr. Purcell for his leadership, courage, and vision and for his strong confidence in the American worker.
