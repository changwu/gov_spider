MAYOR GIULIANI: "When I became Mayor of New York City things were out of control."
BACKGROUND:
WHEN GIULIANI TOOK OFFICE, NEW YORK CITY WAS SEEN AS UNGOVERNABLE
"The City Felt Out Of Control And Unmanaged At The Close Of The David Dinkins Administration; Giuliani Was The Right Leader For The City When Chaos Needed To Be Tamed." (Jack Newfield, Op-Ed, "Giuliani's Eight Years," Newsday, 12/30/01)
"[Giuliani] Will Become The 107th Mayor Of This Seemingly Ungovernable City." (Bruce Frankel and Keith Greenberg, "Giuliani Edges Dinkins In Bitter NYC Contest," USA Today, 11/3/93)
"'Ungovernable' Is The Adjective That Has Been Endlessly Applied To New York City, From The Tammany Hall Days To John Lindsay's Wobbly Vietnam-Era Mayoralty, Through Blackouts And Riots, From Son Of Sam To The Squeegee Guys." (Russell Shorto, Op-Ed, "All Political Ideas Are Local," The New York Times, 10/2/05)
George Will Said New York Was Viewed As Impossible To Govern. George Will: "[T]he wisdom of New York was … that it was impossible to govern the city. … When I say that being Mayor of New York is demanding, I mean this. It has more people than do 39 other states. It is more difficult to govern than all 50 of the states. This for a reason — New York City has been liberalism's laboratory in the 20th century, which means it is a seriously troubled place, or was. It produced a culture of complaint, which led to the politics of victimhood, which led to government by grievance groups, and the learned dependency of an over-developed welfare state." (George Will, Remarks At CPAC, 3/2/07)
WHEN GIULIANI TOOK OFFICE, NEW YORK WAS UNDER SIEGE BY CRIME
When Mayor Giuliani Took Office, There Were 1,946 Murders In 1993 And 11,545 Major Crimes Per Week. ("1993 Index Of Crime By Metropolitan Statistical Area," 1993 FBI Uniform Crime Report, p. 139)
"[N]ew York City Is Reinforcing Its Reputation As The Crime Capital Of America. Every 44 Seconds A Crime Is Reported To The Police, Every Four Minutes A Car Is Stolen, Every Six Minutes There Is A Mugging, Every Three Hours There Is A Rape And Every Eight Hours A Murder" (Michelangelo Rucci, "Tales Of A Big, Rotten Apple," The Advertiser, 4/23/90)
WHEN GIULIANI TOOK OFFICE, THERE WAS A FISCAL CRISIS IN NEW YORK CITY
When Giuliani Took Office, New York Was Facing Its "Worst Fiscal Crisis Since The 1970's." ("New York: Giuliani Seeks To Delay NYC Recycling Law," Greenwire, 3/29/94)
Giuliani Faced Fiscal Crisis When He Took Office In 1994. "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances. Under a tough law passed after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, he will be required to explain in January how he plans to close the gap in the current year's budget, estimated at about $400 million [and growing]. Soon after, he will be required to come up with the outline of his budget for the fiscal year starting next summer, which currently contains a projected $1.5-billion deficit [and growing]." (Karen Rothmyer, "Giuliani Seen As Good For Business," Newsday, 11/4/93)
New York Times: "The Budget Mr. Giuliani Submitted To The City Council Yesterday Was His Formal Plan For Fiscal 1995, Starting July 1. He Faced An Awesome $2.3 Billion Deficit – The Largest Since The City's Fiscal Crisis In The Mid-1970's" (Editorial, "A Responsible Budget," The New York Times, 5/11/94)
Ultimately, New York City Faced $2.3 Billion Dollar Budget Deficit For Mayor Giuliani's First Fiscal Year. (Steven Lee Myers, "A Deficit Revisited," The New York Times, 7/31/94)

CNN's Bill Press In 1998: "[New York City] Used To Be The Welfare Capital Of The Nation …" (CNN's "Crossfire," 2/27/98)
New York Was Known As Welfare Capital Of The World. "At least a few New Yorkers have long despaired of making non-New Yorkers grasp the gargantuan perversity of the city's welfare system. Help has arrived. 'Hands to Work,' by Columbia journalism Prof. LynNell Hancock, purports to be an expose of welfare reform under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. It is far more profitably read as a breathtaking tour of the mindset — supplied by the author and by those she writes about — that for decades made New York the welfare capital of the world." (Heather MacDonald, Op-Ed, "When Bad Habits Met A Mayor Who Wouldn't Put Up With Them," The Wall Street Journal, 1/23/02)
George Will: "Under [Mayor] Lindsay And His Welfare Administrator Michael Ginsberg, Known As Michael 'Come-And-Get-It' Ginsberg, The Welfare Rolls Went From 200,000 To 800,000." (George Will, Remarks At CPAC, 3/2/07)

"A study commissioned by the Hotel Association of the City of New York and the New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association found that the city is the highest-taxed destination in the country, at $23.74 per night, compared with $7.67 in other major cities. As a result, hoteliers and tourism officials say, the city is losing business, some of it just across the Hudson to hotels in New Jersey." (Alan Wax, "Hoteliers Push For Repeal Of Occupancy Tax," Newsday, 5/24/93)
Professional Convention Management Association Organized A Boycott Of New York City Over High Hotel Taxes. "The [hotel] tax has annoyed various meeting planners to the extent that some are boycotting New York. The Birmingham, Ala.-based Professional Convention Management Association, a major organizer of medical association meetings, said it will no longer schedule events in New York and urged its 3,100 members to avoid the state until the tax is repealed." (Alan Wax, "Hoteliers Push For Repeal Of Occupancy Tax," Newsday, 5/24/93)

AD FACT:
MAYOR GIULIANI: "Made government more accountable."
BACKGROUND:
GIULIANI MADE NEW YORK CITY MORE ACCOUNTABLE
Giuliani Cited Accountability In His Acceptance Of Award For Distinguished Leadership. "The Republican mayor, who's nearing the end of a second term, spoke at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after receiving Columbia Business School's 2001 award for distinguished leadership in government. … Giuliani, however, wanted to be held accountable. 'We've tried to introduce accountability into how this city is governed,' he said." ("Giuliani Receives Leadership Award," The Associated Press, 5/7/01)
"How Did Giuliani Do It? He Was Able To Turn The City Around, [Fred] Siegel Argues, Because He Scrapped The Great Society-Style Governing Philosophy That Had Dominated The City's Politics Since The 1960s And Replaced It With One That Emphasized Hard Work, Individual Responsibility, And Accountability." (Adelle Waldman, "The Mayor Who (Some Say) Saved His City," The Christian Science Monitor, 6/28/05)
"The Mayor Was Prepared To Take Responsibility For His Actions, Rather Than Blame His Staff. He Still Carries A Sign On His Desk Saying, 'I'm Responsible.'" (Alice Thomson, "Rudy Can Teach Tony Blair How To Govern," The [London] Daily Telegraph, 2/15/02)
GIULIANI USED COMPSTAT TO TURN NEW YORK'S CRIME PROBLEM AROUND
CompStat Program "At The Core" Of "Turnaround In New York City." "People ask me all the time, how did you do it? How did you take New York City from being the crime capital of America to being the safest large city in the country? How did you take it from being the welfare capital of America … [to] being the welfare-to-work capital of America? How did you take it from a deficit to a surplus, and all the things that were part of the turnaround in New York City? Well, there were a lot of components to it. … But if there's one program that probably is at the core of it, it's the CompStat program." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
CompStat's Timely Statistics, Rapid Deployment Of Resources And Relentless Follow Up Held Government Accountable. "If New York City were a business and therefore were accountable, how would you deal with it? And that led us in part to the CompStat program. … This is what CompStat is all about: accurate and timely intelligence, effective tactics, rapid deployment of personnel and resources, and relentless follow-up and assessment. The key to CompStat is not only deciding what the measure of success is going to be, and measuring it every day on … [T]he key to it is relentless follow-up and assessment. Having a CompStat meeting every week. Because very often in businesses or in governments all these statistics are created and people take them and they put them in their drawer, and six months later they look at the statistics. The innovation that CompStat brought about was, it required everyone to confront the statistics every week." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
Other Local, State And Even Foreign Governments Have Found Success With CompStat-Like Programs. "[E]very place that has used these programs, including Los Angeles and many cities in the country and now some foreign countries have found them to be revolutionary in being able to turn governments into accountable, responsible organizations." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
GIULIANI INTRODUCED SIMILAR ACCOUNTABILITY PROGRAMS TO OTHER CITY AGENCIES
CAPStat
In August 2001, Mayor Giuliani Introduced CAPStat For 18 City Agencies. "Mayor Rudolph Giuliani unveiled a new accountability initiative at City Hall on Wednesday … The mayor outlined his CAPSTAT program, in which 18 city agencies will adopt a reporting plan based on the Police Department's Compstat program. Top officials in those agencies, which include the health and fire departments, will now be accountable for their productivity during weekly meetings with supervisors. Results of the data gathered – for instance, the number of potholes filled during a certain period – will be posted by each agency on the city's Web site." (Timothy Williams, "Giuliani Invites Billionaire Candidate To Policy Address," The Associated Press, 8/15/01)
HealthStat
In 2000, Giuliani Launched HealthStat, Which Used Accountability And Sophisticated Mapping Technology To Reduce The Number Of Uninsured City Residents. All City agencies were mobilized to identify the uninsured and help them enroll in public health insurance programs. (Mayor Rudy Giuliani, "Mayor Giuliani Launches HealthStat Public Awareness Campaign," Press Release, 11/27/00)
HealthStat, Like NYPD's CompStat, Used Computer Mapping To Identify Neighborhoods With Most Uninsured Residents, Allowing City To Reach Out To Right Communities. (David Seifman, "Rudy's 'Healthy' Change Of Heart," New York Post, 6/15/00)
One Year After Establishing HealthStat, More Than 150,000 Children Had Been Enrolled In Health Programs. (Mayor Rudy Giuliani, "Mayor Giuliani Announces Back-To-School Campaign To Enroll Children In Health Insurance At Stores And Schools Citywide," Press Release, 8/29/01)
JobStat
"Modeled After CompStat, The Police Department's Highly Successful Crime-Management Tool, JobStat … Is Ushering In A New Way Of Thinking At The City's Welfare Agency. For The First Time, The Welfare Behemoth Is Being Held Accountable For Its Performance In A Meaningful Way." (Editorial, "JobStat Works For Welfare," Daily News, 10/4/99)
JobStat Allowed "City To Examine Each Welfare Case With The Aim Of Finding Productive Employment For Welfare Recipients. This Not Only Saved The Taxpayers Money, It Contributed To The City's Economy." (Editorial, "New York, A Success Story," Daily News, 4/10/00)
JobStat Helped Force Change From Welfare Mentality Into Workforce Mentality. "In New York, which had become an international welfare mecca, the results were especially startling – thanks entirely to Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a longtime welfare-reform advocate. Giuliani's leadership forced a change from the welfare mentality to one of workfare – in which administrators worked with recipients to wean them off paid benefits and into permanent jobs. As the former mayor put it, 'The best social program is a job.'" (Editorial, "Ten Years Of Success," New York Post, 8/22/06)

Giuliani Will Restore Fiscal Discipline And Cut Wasteful Spending
Mayor Giuliani: "All Spending Is Discretionary. Read The Constitution. Congress Has To Appropriate It; The President Has To Sign It. All Spending Is Discretionary And It Has To Be Looked At From The Point Of View Of, Can We Afford It Now? Is It Appropriate To Pass It On To The Next Generation? This Is What I Did In New York City. I Restored Fiscal Discipline …" (Mayor Giuliani, Remarks On His 12 Commitments To The American People, Bedford, NH, 6/12/07)
Giuliani Will End Anonymous Earmarks, Concealed Budgeting, And Special Interests Waste Taxpayer Dollars Within The Federal Budget. (Rudy Giuliani For President Website www.joinrudy2008.com/commitment/indepth/2, Accessed 11/19/07)

(Rudy Giuliani For President Website www.joinrudy2008.com/commitment/indepth/2, Accessed 11/19/07)
A President Giuliani Will Require Agencies To Identify At Least 5% To 20% In Spending Reductions. Requiring agency heads to identify savings and increased efficiencies in each annual budget – as Rudy Giuliani did as Mayor – is a management tool that will lead to constant streamlining and more cost-effective government spending without compromising national security in the search for savings. (Rudy Giuliani For President Website www.joinrudy2008.com/commitment/indepth/2, Accessed 11/19/07)
Giuliani Will Use GAPStat to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Federal Agencies & Eliminate Wasteful Spending.

Giuliani Will Cut Taxes To Keep America's Economy Strong & Create Jobs
Giuliani Will Cut Taxes As President. Giuliani: "I've seen how pro-growth policies lead to broader prosperity. We'll not only keep the current tax cuts in place or their equivalent, we'll enact additional tax relief and give the Death Tax the death penalty. High tax rates hurt business and destroy jobs. I know that tax cuts are good for the economy. It's not just theory for me because I cut taxes and got results as Mayor of New York City. As President, I will cut taxes further."

Giuliani Will Impose Accountability On Washington
Giuliani Will Create New Accountability Standards For Government. Giuliani: "We'll make it a FedStat program, and we will use it — we will use it to measure the effectiveness of what we're doing: measure the effectiveness of what we're doing at the border with the BorderStat program, measure the effectiveness of protecting America with the TerrorStat program, measure the effectiveness on our State Department, on our Defense Department, and all the agencies of government doing the thing what they're supposed to do, to make America's mission more effective in the world, to make America's military modern and able to deal with the — in a flexible way, with the challenges they have today. You get what you measure. If you don't have measurement standards, government's out of control." (Mayor Giuliani, Remarks On His 12 Commitments To The American People, Bedford, NH, 6/12/07)
FedStat Can Bring The Accountability Standards Mayor Giuliani Applied In New York To Washington. "Now, this is what we should apply to the federal government, in order to satisfy the complaints and the criticisms of the people who say 'Washington doesn't accomplish anything.' The concept must be — and if I were president, this is the way I would do it, and we're going to begin organizing it now, because we began organizing what we were going to do in New York City 18 months before — we've got to look at each one of the functions of the federal government and impose business-like standards on it, CompStat standards on it." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
"The Major Purpose Of [FedStat] Is Accountability. It Begins With The President. I Have On My Desk A Sign That Says, 'I'm Accountable.'" (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
BorderStat Will Help Secure Our Borders. "There should be a BorderStat program. The BorderStat program should measure the number of people coming over the border. The BorderStat program should try to determine how many people are coming over the border that are undetected. As the government rolls out its high technology program … the technology is going to be there to figure out how many people are coming over that are undetected. That should be recorded every day, every night. It should be examined every single morning. And you should look at it and see how successful you're being in stopping people from coming over the border. … The BorderStat program can bring about what we desperately need, which is control of our borders." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
TerrorStat Will Help Keep Us Safe From Terrorist Attacks. "You can take the CompStat program and you can apply it to terror — TerrorStat. It's a program that is … being developed in certain places in the country. It should be developed for the entire country, that is, trying to figure out what are the precursors that suggest that there's going to be a terrorist act, suspicious activity. … You need a system to make sure that we're getting all that information and we're getting the best use out of local law enforcement. … [T]he FBI is limited in resources. Local police are unlimited in resources, hundreds of thousands. Is it 700,000 local police? … They should be our eyes and ears with the FBI helping to coordinate that, work with that, working with them. A TerrorStat program can get that intelligence to the right place." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
GAPStat – Government Accountability Program Stat – Will Impose Fiscal Discipline And Reduce The Size Of Government. "A GAPStat program can help us measure whether we're actually imposing fiscal discipline on the government. It's my promise that I would reduce the size of the federal employees. … 42 percent of them are retiring in the next 10 years. My objective would be to try to replace about half those positions. No one would lose their job, but the position wouldn't get filled. We would replace those positions with technology or with figuring out how people can be more productive. Well, you've got to track that. You have to have a GAPStat program to track that, and to track the out-of-control expenditures in each one of the agencies." (Mayor Giuliani, Press Conference, New York, NY, 5/31/07)
AD FACT:
MAYOR GIULIANI: "I know that reducing taxes produces more revenues."
BACKGROUND:
CUTTING TAXES INCREASES REVENUE
Supply-Side Economics Brings In Increased Revenue With Lower Tax Rates. CNBC's LARRY KUDLOW: "The level of revenues, federal tax collection revenues is higher in 2006 than it was at the peak of the Clinton boom in 2000, and that's after multiple Bush tax cuts. Moreover, Art, even the level of personal income revenues and tax collections is higher. Now, does that or does that not support the Laffer Curve?" ART LAFFER: "Of course, it does … Bush's tax cuts clearly have worked and so did Reagan's, so did Kennedy's." (CNBC's "Kudlow & Company," 1/23/07)
Economist Thomas Sowell Explained That Tax Cuts, Like Kennedy's, Reagan's And Bush's, Result In Higher Tax Revenues. "Nor is the idea new that tax cuts can sometimes spur economic growth, resulting in more jobs for workers and higher earnings for business, leading to more tax revenue for the government. A highly regarded economist once observed that 'taxation may be so high as to defeat its object,' so that sometimes 'a reduction of taxation will run a better chance, than an increase, of balancing the Budget.' Who said that? Milton Friedman? Arthur Laffer? No. It was said in 1933 by John Maynard Keynes, a liberal icon. Lower tax rates have led to higher tax revenues many times, both before and since Keynes's statement — the Kennedy tax cuts in the 1960s, the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s, and the recent Bush tax cuts that have led to record high tax revenues this April." (Thomas Sowell, Op-Ed, "Angry Left," National Review, 5/15/07)
REVENUE FROM FEDERAL CAPITAL GAINS TAX DOUBLED AFTER RATES WERE CUT
"Capital Gains Revenues Doubled After The 2003 Capital Gains Tax Cuts, From $50 Billion To $103 Billion In 2006. Before The Tax Cuts, The CBO Projected Such Revenues Would Rise To Only $68 Billion." (Brian Riedl, "Taxing Myths," National Review, 4/17/07)

GIULIANI CUT HOTEL OCCUPANCY TAX AND REVENUES INCREASED
Giuliani Worked With City Council Speaker Vallone And Heavily Democratic City Council To Cut Hotel Occupancy Tax In His First Budget. "'The budget that the City Council will adopt reduces spending by over $100 million from last year's budget and reduces City headcount by 15,000. This budget will eliminate the City portion of the hotel occupancy tax, as well as reduce the commercial rent tax,' said Mayor Giuliani. 'It is a testament to our collective willingness to employ creative strategies to downsize government and cut taxes.'" (Mayor Rudy Giuliani, "Mayor Giuliani and Speaker Vallone Agree on FY '95 Budget," Press Release, 6/21/94).
Giuliani's Efforts Led To 28% Reduction In Effective Rate Of Combined State And City Hotel Room Occupancy Tax. "The 1994 repeal of the hotel-occupancy tax, often plugged by Giuliani as exemplary (and carried out jointly with the administration of Gov. Mario Cuomo), is a prime example of the divide: Before December, 1994, hotel guests paying $100 and more for rooms in the city forked over 21.25 percent in state and city taxes, plus a $2-per-night city surcharge. Now the combined rate is 15.25 percent, plus the surcharge. Five percentage points of the cut was state tax, and one point of it, city tax." (Dan Janison, "Rudy's Record," Newsday, 5/25/97)
After Cut, City Revenue From Hotel Occupancy Tax Increased By 88.7%, From $128.9 Million In Fiscal 1994 to $243.3 Million In Fiscal 2001. (New York City Office Of The Comptroller, "Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Of The Comptroller For The Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2003," p. 243)
