 WH travel pool report #2: AF1 boarding 
Marine One landed at 4:58 pm.
POTUS, FLOTUS and their son Barron stepped out on to the tarmac and POTUS waved to the press before boarding AF1. The president did not take questions.
As noted on Friday, we're taking the smaller plane so your pooler will not have cell service. We're boarding for DC at 5:03 pm.
