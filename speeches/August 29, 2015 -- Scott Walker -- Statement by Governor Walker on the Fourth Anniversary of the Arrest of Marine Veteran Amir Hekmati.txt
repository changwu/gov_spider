    Charlotte, N.C. -- Today on the fourth anniversary of Iran's arrest of Marine veteran Amir Hekmati, Governor Scott Walker released the below statement:
"Four years ago, Iranian agents arrested Marine veteran Amir Hekmati on bogus charges, and he remains in an Iranian prison to this day. As I heard when I met with Amir's family, the Iranians have since tortured him and forced him to endure solitary confinement and psychological suffering. It's shameful that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have ignored Amir's plight, while making repeated concessions to Iran in order to secure their dangerous nuclear deal.
"Ensuring Americans' safety is a president's number one priority. That's why as commander in chief, I would terminate the bad Iran nuclear deal on day one and turn up the pressure on the regime to release Amir and the other innocent American hostages held in Iran."
