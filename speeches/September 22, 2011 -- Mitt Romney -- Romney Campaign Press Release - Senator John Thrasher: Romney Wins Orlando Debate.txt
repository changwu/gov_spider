    Florida State Senator John Thrasher issued the following statement on tonight's Orlando debate:
"Mitt Romney came out on top in the debate tonight by sharing his vision for getting America back to work. His experience in the real economy is unparalleled in this field of candidates, and he demonstrates the leadership necessary to create jobs and turn this economy around. President Obama's failure to do so will be the critical issue of this election.
"Our nominee must also be someone who will save Social Security, not someone who will dismantle it. Millions of Americans rely on this program. Does Rick Perry think it will be feasible for these hardworking Americans to still receive the benefits they have been promised if Social Security is run by the states? The federal government has an obligation to honor its end of the bargain, and Mitt Romney will ensure Social Security is sustainable for future generations."
