    I join the American people in sending my congratulations to all those observing Croatian Statehood Day. Since Croatia declared its independence in 1991, our two nations have enjoyed a close relationship, and we have proudly supported the people of Croatia as they have taken their rightful place in the community of nations. Croatia has built its democracy at home and continues to contribute to regional and global security. Our joint membership in NATO makes us allies, but our relationship makes us friends. Here in America, those Americans that trace their origins to Croatia or have family there should be proud of the lasting ties between our two nations.
