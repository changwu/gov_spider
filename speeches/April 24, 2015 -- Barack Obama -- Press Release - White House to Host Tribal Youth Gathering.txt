    WASHINGTON, DC – On Thursday, July 9, 2015, the White House will host the first-ever White House Tribal Youth Gathering in Washington, DC, to provide American Indian and Alaska Native youth from across the country the opportunity to interact directly with senior Administration officials and the White House Council on Native American Affairs.
The Tribal Youth Gathering, a collaboration between the White House and Unity Inc., will continue to build upon the President's Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) initiative and his commitment to improve the lives of Native youth across the country. President Obama launched the Gen-I initiative at the 2014 White House Tribal Nations Conference to focus on improving the lives of Native youth through new investments and increased engagement. This initiative takes a comprehensive, culturally appropriate approach to ensure all young Native people can reach their full potential.
The Gen-I Native Youth Challenge invites Native youth and organizations across the country to become a part of the Administration's Gen-I initiative by joining the National Native Youth Network — a White House effort in partnership with the Aspen Institute's Center for Native American Youth and the U.S. Department of the Interior. Youth who complete the Gen-I Native Youth Challenge will be eligible to register for a chance to attend the upcoming White House Tribal Youth Gathering. The application to attend the Gathering can be found HERE. Additional details about the conference will be released at a later date.
