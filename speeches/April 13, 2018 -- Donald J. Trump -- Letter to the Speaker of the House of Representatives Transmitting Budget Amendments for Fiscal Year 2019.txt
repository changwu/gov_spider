    Dear Mr. Speaker: 
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed fiscal year (FY) 2019 Budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Social Security Administration, U.S. Agency for International Development, and Other International Programs.
These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies assumed in my FY 2019 Budget. These amendments include correction amendments, which would not affect the overall FY 2019 budget authority totals. In addition, these amendments include the appropriations language needed to formally reflect the February 12, 2018, "Addendum to the President's FY 2019 Budget to Account for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018" (Addendum). Consistent with the aforementioned February 12, 2018, Addendum, these amendments would increase the total net discretionary budget authority counted under the discretionary spending caps in my FY 2019 Budget by $95 billion, with $20 billion more counted under the defense cap and $75 billion more counted under the non-defense cap. This would bring base discretionary funding in my FY 2019 Budget to the defense cap specified in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 of $647 billion while holding non-defense funding to $540 billion, or $57 billion below the non-defense cap.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,







      





DONALD J. TRUMP
