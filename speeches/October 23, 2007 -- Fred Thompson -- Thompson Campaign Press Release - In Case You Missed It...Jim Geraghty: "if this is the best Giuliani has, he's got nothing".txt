A couple of my regular readers really aren't biting on Giuliani's criticism of Thompson's votes on immigration enforcement back in the 1990s.
Jeff notes that on the four votes cited by Giuliani, the percent of Republican Senators who voted the same way as Thompson were 96 percent, 62 percent, 98 percent, and 87 percent, for an average of 86 percent. So if Thompson was insufficiently conservative or tough on these votes, then vast swaths of the Republican caucus were, too.
Then a Campaign Spot reader in Texas (who isn't Governor Rick Perry) notes that on Thompson's missed vote, "the cloture vote passed 91-0. Thompson's presence wouldn't have made one bit of difference... Bottom line -- if this is the best Giuliani has, he's got nothing. And I say that as a Guiliani fan (I've been waffling, but Deroy Murdock moved me to RG's camp with his detailed run-down of Rudy's actual accomplishments in fighting race preferences in New York City.)"
