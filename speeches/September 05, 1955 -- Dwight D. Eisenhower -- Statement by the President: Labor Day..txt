    THIS DAY is set aside, in our country, for America to salute the men and women who with their heads, hands and hearts produce the wealth of the Nation.
All of us are proud that the working men and women of our land labor in freedom and dignity, with efficiency and enthusiasm, at the jobs of their choice, in whatever community they wish, and receive fair compensation for their efforts.
We can also be proud that the individual human beings who make up this great labor force come from all races, all religions, and all national origins. They work on farms, in factories, in stores, in mines and in offices. They work on land and on sea and in the air.
In honoring the Nation's workers today, we reaffirm our devotion to the Nation itself--which over the years and decades, American workmen have built.
