    Thank you very much. You know, I felt, even when I thought there were just a couple of hundred people here, I felt so badly for you having to wait and wait and wait.
But let me tell you, you should know at least it is a lot cooler in here than it is in there. We have had a wonderful, wonderful time here. We are very grateful to all of you for coming out, for supporting your schools, supporting your communities, supporting your country, and we thank you so much. And of course, just personally, it's meant a great deal to Al and Tipper and to Hillary and me to see you here and see you so enthusiastic about the future.
I want you to remember how you feel tonight, and I want you to keep it with you all year long. We've got a lot to do, and it's going to be good for America.
God bless you.
