Today, Tennessee Congressman Phil Roe endorsed Marco Rubio for president. Congressman Roe is joining Governor Bill Haslam and Senator Lamar Alexander in endorsing Marco.
Congressman Roe issued the following statement in support of Marco:
When I think about this election, I'm reminded of how the generations before us chose leaders of optimism and strength at critical moments in our history. Today we face a critical moment, and we have to decide what kind of country we want to leave our children and grandchildren. I believe we're lucky to have a next generation leader like Marco Rubio working to inspire and unite our people the way Ronald Reagan once did. I believe our Party would be remiss to pass up this opportunity to build a brighter, more conservative future for America. Marco's innovative vision will extend the American experiment into a new century and restore opportunity to the greatest nation on earth.

Congressman Roe represents Tennessee's 1st congressional district. He was first elected in 2008, and during his time in the House, Roe has been a strong voice for conservative principles, and an advocate for our country's veterans.
