    The President is encouraged by today's agreement between Senators Grassley and Baucus, and the progress being made in Congress to improve and strengthen Medicare, including providing seniors with a prescription drug benefit. We have a real opportunity to get something done this year, while providing America's seniors with more choices and better benefits so they can choose the care that best meets their individual health needs.
The President will continue to work with Congress to pass Medicare reform this year.
