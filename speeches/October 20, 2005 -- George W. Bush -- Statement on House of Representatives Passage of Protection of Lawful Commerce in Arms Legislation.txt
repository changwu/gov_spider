    I commend the House for passing the "Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act." Our laws should punish criminals who use guns to commit crimes, not law-abiding manufacturers of lawful products. This legislation will further our efforts to stem frivolous lawsuits, which cause a logjam in America's courts, harm America's small businesses, and benefit a handful of lawyers at the expense of victims and consumers. I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
