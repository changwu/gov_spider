Boston, MA - During a visit to Tallahassee today to meet with state and local leaders, Governor Mitt Romney announced that 10 Florida legislators have endorsed his candidacy for President. These members of the Florida State Legislature include State Senators JD Alexander, Carey Baker and Stephen R. Wise as well as State Representatives Marti Coley, Michael J. Grant, Alan Hays, Ed Hooper, Trey Traviesa and Trudi Williams.
"I am proud to have the support of these respected and accomplished lawmakers," said Governor Romney. "Through Republican leadership, Florida has become a national model for translating conservative principles into successful policies. We showed the same type of discipline in Massachusetts and that is exactly what is needed now in Washington. I look forward to sharing my vision with Floridians as we discuss the solutions needed to meet a new generation of challenges."
These leaders join a strong and growing Florida organization that includes an accomplished Florida Steering Committee and a Florida Statewide Finance Team comprised of nearly 80 business and community leaders from across the state. The Florida Steering Committee is chaired by former Lieutenant Governor Toni Jennings, former Speakers of the House Allan Bense and John Thrasher, former Chairman of the Florida Republican Party Al Cardenas and U.S. Congressman Tom Feeney.
Additional Florida legislators who have endorsed Governor Romney include State Representatives Dennis Baxley, Jennifer Carroll, Anitere Flores and Dick Kravitz. Former Senator and Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida Van Poole and former Representative Dudley Goodlette have also endorsed Governor Romney. Each serves as a Co-Chair of Governor Romney's Steering Committee.
