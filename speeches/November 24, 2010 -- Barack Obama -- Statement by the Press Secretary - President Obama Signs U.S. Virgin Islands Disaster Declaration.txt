Federal funding is available to Territory and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, rockslides, and mudslides associated with Tropical Storm Tomas during the period of November 8-12, 2010, on the island of St. Croix.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures Territory-wide.
