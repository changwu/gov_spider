    President Trump. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Phuc with us from Vietnam, and we are already in discussions as to some very major topics, including trade. We have a major trade deficit with Vietnam which will, hopefully, balance out in the short period of time. We expect to be able to do that. They've just made a very large order in the United States—and we appreciate that—for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam.
And I just want to thank you very much for you and all of your representatives to be with us today. Thank you very much.
[At this point, Prime Minister Phuc made brief remarks in Vietnamese, and no translation was provided. President Trump then spoke as follows.]
President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody.
