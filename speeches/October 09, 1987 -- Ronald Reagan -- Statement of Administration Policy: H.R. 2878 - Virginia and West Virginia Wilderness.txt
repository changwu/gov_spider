    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Olin (D) Virginia and eight others)
The administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2878, but will seek changes in the Senate to delete two parcels totalling 42 acres from the wilderness designations of the bill because the mineral rights to these parcels are in private ownership, and wilderness designation could result in costly Federal acquisition of these rights.
