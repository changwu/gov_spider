Team Marco hit 50 states by adding State Senator Mack "Bodi" White in Louisiana. Check out what he had to say:
After nearly eight years of President Obama in the White House, many working families in Louisiana are rightfully fed up with politics today. But Marco Rubio is the next generation leader we can count on to unite the party and stick to his conservative principles.
Marco's parents sacrificed much to give him a better tomorrow, and he understands the daily struggles of working families better than any other candidate in the race. Marco has a plan to create more jobs and opportunity for all, and as more people across the country hear his message they are drawn to his optimistic vision for our nation's future. I am proud to join 49 other State Chairmen to support Marco Rubio for President.

The nationwide network of conservative leaders supporting Marco is just another sign that his campaign is gaining momentum as the first primaries near.The full list:
