    IN THE course of this meeting, I covered a number of subjects of mutual interest, but as far as a briefing is concerned, I will leave that to President Meany. I came here as the guest of the AFL-CIO, and as I understand, he will be meeting the press at i e o'clock.
I will only say that I was very appreciative of the reception that we had, and I also want to say on one point, if I could, that Mr. Meany--I think I could cover this--particularly in addition to discussing various other economic issues and the like, mentioned the fact that the support that most of the leaders of organized labor gave to our program of national defense and to achieving a peace with honor in Vietnam was indispensable in achieving that peace which we are now seeing in such vivid terms as our POW's return. I expressed appreciation to the leaders of organized labor for that support.
Thank you.
