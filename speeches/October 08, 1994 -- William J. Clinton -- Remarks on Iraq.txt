    Before I leave today I just wanted to say one thing. I have been briefed by the National Security Adviser on the situation in Iraq. We have discussed the measures I have ordered to deal with the situation. And I want to make it clear one more time, it would be a grave error for Iraq to repeat the mistakes of the past or to misjudge either American will or American power.
Thank you very much.
