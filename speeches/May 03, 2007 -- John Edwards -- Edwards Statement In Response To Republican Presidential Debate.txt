    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement in response to tonight's Republican presidential debate.
"Tonight, instead of talking about how they would put an end to the Bush era of mismanagement—from the war in Iraq, to the response to Katrina, to fighting terrorism—the Republican candidates embraced its principles.
"Our country doesn't need more of the same; we need bold change to address the great challenges facing us. Instead of continuing the Bush doctrine of a Global War on Terror, we need a broader approach to fighting terrorism and restoring our moral leadership in the world. Instead of continuing this disastrous war in Iraq, we need to end the war and bring our troops home. And instead of continuing economic policies that widen the gap between the haves and the have nots in our country, we need economic policies that strengthen our middle class and lift up Americans living in poverty."
