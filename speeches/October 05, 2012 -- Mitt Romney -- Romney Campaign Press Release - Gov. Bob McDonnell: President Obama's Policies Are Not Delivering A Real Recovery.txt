    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on President Obama's visit to Virginia and the September unemployment report:
"Today, President Obama came to Virginia to tout his economic record. But today's jobs report reinforced what the 23 million Americans struggling for work already know: President Obama's policies are not working to deliver the real recovery our country needs. We limp from month to month of sluggish job growth that is barely sufficient to keep up with population growth and falls far short of the President's promise to bring unemployment down below five-and-a-half percent. In spite of this extraordinary evidence of his poor stewardship, the President made clear during Wednesday night's debate that his plan for a second term is to double down on the very same failed policies. Mitt Romney will reverse this president's disastrous course. He has a plan to create 12 million new jobs by the end of his first term, and under his leadership, Americans will experience the real recovery they need and deserve."
