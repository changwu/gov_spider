    Brad Miller has served the people of North Carolina for two decades. In the House of Representatives, Brad helped lead the fight to protect families from abuses by the financial industry and is a key reason why today we finally have a strong watchdog in place looking out for American consumers. Michelle and I thank Brad for his service and wish him the very best in the future.
