    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report two proposals to rescind a total of $122.2 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting five new deferrals of budget authority totalling $1,028.5 million and ten revisions to previously transmitted deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $598.6 million.
The rescission proposals affect programs in the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
The new deferrals and revisions to existing deferrals involve programs in the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Health, Education and Welfare, the Interior, Justice, State, Transportation, the Treasury, and the National Alcohol Fuels Commission.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
