    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China has invited a bipartisan congressional delegation to visit China during December.
The delegation will depart December 1 and return December 18. The group will be led by Senator Harrison A. Williams, Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who will be accompanied by his wife.
Other members of the group include Senators Henry Bellmon (R-Okla.), Howard Cannon (D-Nev.), Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), and Donald Riegle, Jr., (D-Mich.), who will be accompanied by their wives.
The Senators will be accompanied by Robert N. Thomson, Special Assistant for Congressional Liaison; Walter Ramsay, Senator Williams' legislative assistant; and Dr. Jerome Korcak, Robert Perito, and Fran Hess, Department of State.
Since the first congressional delegation went to the People's Republic of China in 1972, more than 100 Members of Congress have visited China.
The exchange relationship fulfills that part of the Shanghai Communiqu√© in which both sides pledged to foster broader understanding and engage in cultural and scientific exchanges.
This will be the fourth congressional delegation to visit China in 1978.
