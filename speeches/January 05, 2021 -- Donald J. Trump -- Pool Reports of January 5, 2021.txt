In-town pool #1 — Good morning from the White House
Hi,The pool has been tested for COVID-19.
President Trump has no public events on his schedule and that hasn't changed so far.
A bit of color on the way in:
Police cars were stationed at intersections along 18th street to prevent non-essential traffic from heading eastward along Pennsylvania Avenue NW, H Street, and the like — essentially creating a one-block buffer along the west flank of the White House complex ahead of expected protests this week.
Workers were boarding up sites along the lettered cross streets — for instance, the first-story front windows of an office building between the Taylor Gourmet and Starbucks on Pennsylvania Ave.

In-town pool #2 — Lunch lid
The White House called a lunch lid until 2 p.m.
All quiet so far, though the president has been tweeting about Georgia and electors.
No guidance so far on how the president plans to watch the Georgia results tonight but will let you know if I find anything out.

In-town pool #3 — Still quiet
Just checking in. Still quiet and no new guidance.
You will see that President Trump confirmed he will be speaking to a rally on the Ellipse at 11 a.m. tomorrow.
Also, a fellow journalist said she spotted the Marine outside of the West Wing around the time of the president's tweet saying to protesters: "We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office."
