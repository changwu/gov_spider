    President Perez has developed into one of my best personal friends and is a great counselor and adviser for me on matters that concern the nations of the Caribbean and Central and South America.
Also, he was of great assistance in the negotiations between ourselves and Panama in developing the terms of the treaty.
The people of our country look upon President Perez as a great leader in this hemisphere and also, of course, the leader of one of the great democracies of the world.
