    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
I am transmitting an alternative plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services for 2018.
I strongly support our men and women in uniform, who are the greatest fighting force in the world and the guardians of American freedom. As our country continues to recover from serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, we must work to rebuild our military's readiness and capabilities.
Accordingly, I have determined it is appropriate to exercise my authority under section 1009(e) of title 37, United States Code, to set the 2018 monthly basic pay increase at 2.1 percent. This decision is consistent with my fiscal year 2018 Budget and it will not materially affect the Federal Government's ability to attract and retain well-qualified members for the uniformed services.
The adjustments described above shall take effect on January 1, 2018.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
