    I congratulate Tony Blinken on his nomination to serve as Deputy Secretary of State. He is a genuine superstarâ€”admired and respected not only by the President and me, but by his counterparts in capitals in every region of the world. Like Bill Burns, Tony has a style and a manner that is conducive to getting things done. He has been able to establish strong diplomatic relationships because he has absolute integrity. To know Tony is to trust and like him. I have now had the good fortune to work alongside Tony Blinken for many years. He has been tested, and he has shown grace under pressure and uncommonly good judgment. He is a good man. I'm proud of him.
