    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Goodlatte (R) VA and two others)
The Administration supports the goal of H.R. 1000 -- identifying ineligible Food Stamp recipients and terminating their benefits -- and has no objection to House passage of the bill. The Administration will work in the Senate to amend H.R. 1000 to ensure that the bill achieves its goal in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1000 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's scoring estimate of the bill is under development.
