    Dear Mr. Secretary:
Thank you very much for the report that you and Mr. Barnes sent me about the Conference on Technical and Distribution Research for the Benefit of Small Business. I am delighted that the Conference was successful both in making better known the many facilities for strengthening the position of small businesses and also in developing a specific program for further accomplishment in this respect. The great interest the participants displayed in the importance of technical and distribution research clearly reflects the characteristic initiative and imagination of the small businessmen of our nation. I am confident that the regional discussions planned for the future will significantly augment the benefits of this first Conference and further enlarge the vital role of small business in our way of life.
I shall expect the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration to render all possible assistance along the lines that you and Mr. Barnes recommended for extending knowledge and beneficial use of technical and distribution research. I shall look forward to hearing from you from time to time on the progress that is made.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
