    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
At my request, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget has issued guidelines about the use of zero-based budgeting in the Executive Branch.
This is a new system, and I recognize that your staff may need advice about how to interpret and apply it. Wherever possible, I want you to rely on OMB for information about this system, rather than turning to outside commercial consultants. I have asked the OMB to designate members of the program and budget staff as zero-based budgeting representatives. They will give you the information you need about establishing the process and using it effectively.
Within your own office, I ask that you name one or two members of the budget staff to serve a similar function as sources of information on the zero-based budgeting system. This approach will help ensure that zero-based budgeting is applied uniformly throughout the Executive Branch and that we save the wasted effort and unnecessary cost of relying on consultants.
