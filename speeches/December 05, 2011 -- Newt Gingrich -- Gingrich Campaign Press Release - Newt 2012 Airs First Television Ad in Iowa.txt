Some people say the America we know and love is a thing of the past. I don't believe that. Because working together I know we can rebuild America. We can revive our economy and create jobs. Shrink government and the regulations that strangle our businesses. Throw out the tax and replace it with one that is simple and fair. We can regain the world's respect by standing strong again.
Being true to our faith and respecting one another. We can return power to the people and the states we live in so we all will have more freedom, opportunity, and control of our lives.
Yes, working together we can and will Rebuild the America we Love.
