    [The President's remarks are joined in progress.]
The President. ——and this country supports you and admires you and appreciates your dedication. You're doing some hard work. It's hard work to defeat terrorists, killers that wanted to achieve their objective. But we'll succeed; we'll prevail.
I want our troops to understand that not only does the country support them, but we'll win. It's in our national interests that we win. And we will. We've got some powerful, powerful weapons on our side. We've got the men and women who wear the uniform, people who bring such dignity and honor and bring compassion to people who have been suffering under tyranny and are now wondering whether or not the future is bright for them. And we've got freedom on our side too, and freedom is a powerful weapon. People want to be free.
And again, I want to thank you all for your service. I want to thank your families. I wish they were here so I could thank them in person. But your sacrifice has meant a lot. Congratulations for stepping up and volunteering and being a part of history. Thanks for giving me a chance to visit and have a little lunch with you. God bless you all.
