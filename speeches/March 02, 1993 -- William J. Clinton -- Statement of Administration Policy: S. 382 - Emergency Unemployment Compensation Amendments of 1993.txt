    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Moynihan (D) NY and 6 others)
The Administration strongly supports S. 382 and urges its quick enactment. This legislation would assist the unemployed and their families by extending the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program through October 2, 1993. The program will expire in less than a week under current law. In addition, S. 382 includes an innovative worker profiling program to encourage States to link permanently displaced workers to reemployment services early in their period of unemployment. This program would assist workers to gain new jobs.
The Administration is strongly opposed to any substantive amendments to S. 382, including offsetting amendments or ones that would increase the costs of the bill.
