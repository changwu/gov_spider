    Mr. Secretary, thank you. I want to thank you all very much.
Yesterday I talked with the chief executive officers of U.S. auto companies about what they're doing to help us meet the goal of reducing gasoline usage by 20 percent over 10 years. Today I've had the honor of visiting with private sector companies: "Big Brown," FedEx, the Metro bus line, as well as the postal office folks, and DaimlerChrysler as well to talk about how we are using new technologies to convert truck fleets, bus fleets to vehicles that will be able to help meet the goal of reducing gasoline usage by 20 percent over 10 years.
The reason I've come is, I want the American people to understand that there are new technologies on the market that are being used every single day, but there's more we can do. I'm looking forward to working with Congress to meet this goal. And they need to pass meaningful energy legislation as soon as possible, all aiming at making sure that we promote technologies that, for the sake of our national security and for the sake of good environmental policy, we reduce the usage of gasoline.
The goal I laid out of reducing gasoline by 20 percent over 10 years is a realistic goal. In other words, this isn't a pipedream; this is something that our Nation can accomplish. It's going to take more research dollars; it's going to take working with the private sector; and it's going to take innovative leadership. And I thank the folks here who are representing companies that have got innovative leadership, people willing to make use of technologies that change the way we drive and will change the way we live.
So I appreciate you all being with me. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you for your time.
