    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the regional chairs for Mayor Giuliani's campaign in South Carolina. Today's announcement includes both former state office holders and former South Carolina Republican Party officials. Along with Giuliani South Carolina Chairman Barry Wynn, a former head of the South Carolina GOP, this team will help grow the Mayor's campaign across the state.
"Mayor Giuliani's team is made up of some of the most outstanding and committed Party leaders in the state. I'm proud of our team and look forward to a strong campaign in every region of South Carolina," said Giuliani South Carolina Chairman Barry Wynn.
"I decided to join Rudy's team because I believe he can bring to Washington the same bold leadership skills he brought to our nation's largest city. His record as Mayor proves he knows how to cut wasteful spending and reduce the burden on taxpayers," said Pee Dee co-chair Deanna Cochran.
