    Mr. President, Mrs. Marcos:
I thank you very kindly for the especially warm welcome that you have extended to me and Mrs. Ford and to the American people. I have long looked forward to visiting this beautiful country, which is renowned throughout the world for its warm hospitality.
After your more than generous remarks, I now see that all these forecasts are accurate and totally true.
I find it very significant that this visit to the Pacific nations should conclude here in the Philippines, among some of my country's best and oldest Asian friends. Our two countries, Mr. President, have shared a unique history--a unique history together both in times of peace and in times of dire adversity.
The years of common history which bind us together provide a unique relationship of deep understanding and of deep trust which survives the test of time. I am confident that that relationship will continue for many, many years to come.
The past decade, Mr. President, has seen remarkable changes in the world around us, yet that relationship between our two countries has deepened and matured.
We meet today as sovereign nations, each with its own pride and with its own independence. We meet as friends who have known what it is to fight shoulder to shoulder for common ideals.
The days ahead, Mr. President, hold great challenges for our two countries and also great promise. Your country is already moving out and exploring new horizons, both in Asia and elsewhere.
Mr. President, I look forward to the opportunity of discussing with you freely and very frankly the many and varied relationships between our two countries, as well as to the future of Asia.
Thank you again, Mr. President, and to the Philippine people for your especially generous and warm welcome. May I add from the American people to the people of the Philippines--Mabuhay [Best wishes].
