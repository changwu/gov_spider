    Manchester, NH -- Senator Barack Obama has invited the hosts of the From Doubt to Hope book clubs to be his guests at the Nashua Pride game at Holman Stadium tonight. After spending the summer discussing Obama's background with other voters, the book club hosts will be able to ask him questions face to face.
Volunteers have been hosting book clubs around the state to introduce undecided voters to Obama's background by reading his book Dreams From my Father. Reading this unvarnished personal history offers voters a unique opportunity to find out more about Obama and the experiences that shaped him into the leader he is today.
Laconia resident Theresa Peters told the Laconia Daily Sun that: "The book defined for me what this man has and will become. I'm going to vote for him. I'm totally taken with his honesty. I'll never vote Republican again."
From Doubt to Hope book clubs are ongoing in 12 towns around the state: Manchester, Nashua, Portsmouth, Derry, Lebanon, Exeter, Keene, Concord, Laconia, Dover, Peterborough, and Conway.
