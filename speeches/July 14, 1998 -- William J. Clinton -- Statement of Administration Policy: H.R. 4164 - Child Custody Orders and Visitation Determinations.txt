    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Coble (R) North Carolina)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4164, which contains, in part, provisions intended to protect grandparents' visitation rights when their grandchildren move to a different State that denies visitation.
The Administration supports the intent of the bill and will work with the Congress to ensure that this bill will not have any unintended consequences on the larger body of family law dealing with custody cases or create other unintended problems.
