    
Barbara Comstock, who was elected to Congress just in 2014, has joined up with Team Marco.
Here's what she had to say about her pick:
Marco Rubio represents a strong, new generation of leadership who can turn the page from the failed Obama/Clinton policies, focus on the future, rejuvenate our economy, and create a strong, safe and prosperous America that provides everyone the opportunity to experience the American Dream.
Marco understands firsthand the struggles facing middle-class families and he has a plan to revive our stalled economy and put America back to work and on a path toward prosperity. Marco also understands the complex national security challenges we face as a country from threats ranging from ISIS, Iran, al Qaeda, Russia and others.  
Marco deeply believes in American exceptionalism and is committed to reinvigorating our national defense and national security to provide a safer America and a safer world.

Rep. Comstock, who represents Virginia's 10th Congressional District, has been a leader on conservative Republican causes for decades.
After a great night at the #GOPDebate, I'm happy to add an exciting new leader to our growing team. Welcome, @BarbaraComstock! #VAPolitics
