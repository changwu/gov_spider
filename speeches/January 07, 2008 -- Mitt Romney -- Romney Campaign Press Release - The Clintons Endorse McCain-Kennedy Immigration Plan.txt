    President Clinton, Sen. Hillary Clinton Believe McCain's Immigration Plan "The Right Thing To Do."
"Thirdly, I think the humane thing to do here is to give the people that are here and are working and have no law problems, except that they're not here legally, a chance to work their way into legal citizenship. ... It's also consistent with the bill that Senator McCain supported in the Senate. I think it's the right thing to do, and so does Hillary." â€“ President Bill Clinton (Pres.

President Clinton: Hillary And I Agree With Sen. McCain's Immigration Bill. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: "Thirdly, I think the humane thing to do here is to give the people that are here and are working and have no law problems, except that they're not here legally, a chance to work their way into legal citizenship. You know, the vast majority of these people are completely law abiding, and they pay taxes, even, but they're not here lawfully. ... I talk to people, you know, and I try to figure out what's going on. I think that is the fairer system. It's also consistent with the bill that Senator McCain supported in the Senate. I think it's the right thing to do, and so does Hillary." (Pres. Bill Clinton, Hillary For President Campaign Event, Bow, NH, 1/5/08)
