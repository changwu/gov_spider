HOUSTON, Texas â€” Bob Vander Plaats, President and CEO of the FAMiLY LEADER, today announced his endorsement of Ted Cruz for President. The influential conservative leader, who has lent his support to the last two winners of the Iowa Caucus, is considered by many to be a key endorsement amongst Iowa Caucus goers, particularly with evangelicals and strong conservatives.


According to Vander Plaats, "Today is the culmination of a months long process that was deliberative, intensive, and covered in prayer from start to finish. I am confident that Ted Cruz is the right man for the job, and look forward to working with Iowans in every corner of the state to help him win the Iowa Caucus on February 1st."
Joining Vander Plaats at the announcement was FAMiLY LEADER Vice President and Chief Counsel, Chuck Hurley, along with Board Chairman and former Congressional Candidate Robert Cramer. Together, the trio represent a constituency that is highly coveted in the competitive Caucus process.
"This is an endorsement that simultaneously sends a signal to political observers and motivates active Caucus voters," said Cruz. "It's more evidence that our campaign has momentum and is gaining ground heading into the final weeks of the Caucus. This endorsement also speaks to the grassroots activists who have delivered for the past couple of Iowa Caucus winners, that the time has come for us to coalesce. If we as conservatives come together in Iowa, and across the country, we will win."
Vander Plaats, Hurley, and Cramer join Congressman Steve King and Steve Deace as key Iowa political and thought leaders who have publicly endorsed Cruz.
