    THE ONE HUNDREDTH anniversary of the promulgation of the first Constitution of Uruguay, which occurs today, furnishes an occasion for rejoicing to all supporters of republican institutions and friends of liberty and justice. Permit me, as the representative of a sister republic, which has always maintained cordial sentiments of friendship towards your country, to offer you the most hearty felicitations of the Government and people of the United States and their best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of Uruguay.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Juan Campisteguy, President of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, Montevideo ]
