    I have today regretfully accepted the resignation of Paul Coverdell as Director of the Peace Corps of the United States, effective October 1, 1991.
During Paul's tenure as Director, exciting things have happened around the globe. The Peace Corps' entry into emerging democracies around the world has been an important part of America's effort to assist newly freed people everywhere. I am proud of the fact that the Peace Corps has sent volunteers to more new countries during the last 2 years than during the previous 2 decades. I join the people of these nations in thanking him and the Peace Corps for their timely and able assistance.
I am also proud of his efforts to bring to the American classroom the Peace Corps' knowledge of the world through programs like World Wise Schools and the Peace Corps' Fellows/USA. The World Wise Schools program has exposed over 60,000 American students to the international experiences of Peace Corps volunteers stationed throughout the world. The Fellows/USA program places returned Peace Corps volunteers in "at-risk" schools while they pursue master's degrees in education, benefiting both the volunteers and the students. These programs are excellent uses of the many talents of current and returned volunteers.
I salute Paul's efforts to energize the Peace Corps by recruiting a wider representation of volunteers from all backgrounds and all regions of the country. He has worked hard to use his private sector experience to further improve the Peace Corps management systems, and I am grateful for his dedicated service to the Peace Corps and to this country. Both Barbara and I appreciate Paul's friendship and wish Nancy and him the best.
