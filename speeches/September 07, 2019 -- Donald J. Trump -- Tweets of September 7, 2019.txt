Thank you to Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the United States and me their would have been many more casualties.

....I would also like to thank 'Papa' Doug Manchester hopefully the next Ambassador to the Bahamas for the incredible amount of time money and passion he has spent on helping to bring safety to the Bahamas.

I want to congratulate @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and all Republicans. Today I signed the 160th Federal Judge to the Bench. Within a short period of time we will be at over 200 Federal Judges including many in the Appellate Courts & two great new U.S. Supreme Court Justices!Retweets: 18611Favorites: 74747

The Washington Post's @PhilipRucker (Mr. Off the Record) & @AshleyRParker two nasty lightweight reporters shouldn't even be allowed on the grounds of the White House because their reporting is so DISGUSTING & FAKE. Also add the appointment of MANY Federal Judges this Summer! https://t.co/7d33tzKxXqRetweets: 9975Favorites: 38099

The Failing New York Times stated in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book)'Even after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.' THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said VERY EARLY ON that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.....Retweets: 14446Favorites: 69545

...FAKE NEWS. I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the LameStream Media just won't let it alone. They always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding & deceiving the public. The public knows that the Media is corrupt!Retweets: 13962Favorites: 65634

If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill 12 innocent people then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.
