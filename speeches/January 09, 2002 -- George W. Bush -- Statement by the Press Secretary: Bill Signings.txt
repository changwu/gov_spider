    The President was pleased to sign into law yesterday two important conservation measures, the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Reauthorization Act. These new laws will further our national interest in promoting environmental stewardship around the world. They provide important grants to help conserve some of the world's most critically endangered species through public-private international partnerships that deliver on-the-ground conservation projects and build local conservation expertise and capability.
