    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Boren (D) OK)
The Administration strongly opposes S. 1539 because it would require the annual disclosure of the aggregate amount of funds expended, requested, and authorized for U.S. intelligence and intelligence-related programs. If S. 1539 is presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.
The annual disclosures, as required under sections 104 and 105, are likely to raise innumerable questions that can only be answered by disclosing classified activities, which, in turn, could ultimately jeopardize U.S. national security. Six committees of Congress (142 members) currently review intelligence funding in detail, and all members have access to a breakdown of classified programs. These elected officials are in a position to weigh intelligence needs against other competing demands.
The Administration also opposes the significant reductions in the operating budgets of the National Foreign Intelligence Program, as provided for in the classified annex. The magnitude of the reductions in funding would significantly impact the Intelligence Community's ability to meet today's intelligence challenges, especially those pertaining to the United States and Soviet Union. Additional reasons for restoring these reductions have been provided in the classified appeal by the Director of Central Intelligence.
Finally, the Administration notes the language of the classified annex regarding the subordination and reorganization of certain intelligence activities. The Administration welcomes constructive criticism and will examine the merits of the specific recommendations. The Administration, however, will assert the Executive branch's prerogative to organize as necessary to accomplish its mission and will consider such language to be advisory.
