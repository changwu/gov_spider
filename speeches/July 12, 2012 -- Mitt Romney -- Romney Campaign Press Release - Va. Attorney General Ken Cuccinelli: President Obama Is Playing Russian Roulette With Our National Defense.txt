    Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli today made the following statement on President Obama's devastating cuts to defense spending:
"Even Barack Obama's Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, is alarmed about the course the President has set us on. In fact, he's highly alarmed, going so far as to say that it will have the same effect as 'shooting ourselves in the head.' For President Obama to play budgetary Russian roulette with national defense is shameful. The damage to our local economy here in Virginia will be enormous. But the damage to our national security is what really counts. It is absolutely critical that we seriously attack our debt and deficit problems, and that's going to take cooperation to avoid these types of severe sequestration cuts."
