Cameron Sutton, the former state director for Senator Joni Ernst, is backing Marco.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Marco Rubio is bolstering his Iowa team less than a month before the caucuses, with plans to name Cameron Sutton, a longtime Iowa GOP power broker, as co-chair in the state, POLITICO has learned.
Sutton is a former finance-co-chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa and most recently served as state director for Joni Ernst after her election to the U.S. Senate. He quietly left Ernst's operation last month and has already, unannounced and unpaid, begun working to help Rubio in the caucuses.
"We are thrilled to have him," said state Sen. Jack Whitver, who had served as Rubio's sole state chairman.

Sutton joins an already impressive team of Iowa leaders committed to helping Marco in the critical February 1st caucus.
Welcome to Team Marco!
