"I'm very proud of this impressive team led by Beverly Gossage and Mike Pirner. Kansas is a very important state in the primary season, and this large grassroots effort of citizen leaders demonstrates that my citizen-centered model of changing our country is working in the Sunflower State," said Gingrich.
Leading the effort is Statewide Chairwoman Beverly Gossage. Beverly is the owner of HSA Benefits Consulting and a member of the Kansas GOP Executive Committee in Kansas. Her unique experience as an educator, broker and health care reform specialist has given her firsthand knowledge of the current health insurance marketplace and the complex reasons for high health care costs. Consequently, she is requested nationwide to educate businesses, individuals, legislators and government employees on the impact of the federal health reform law.  She has spoken at numerous conferences, including ALEC, NCSL, LOMA, NCPA, SPN, TIBA, NFIB and state and local Chambers of Commerce.  Gossage serves on three of the eight Exchange Working Groups and has been instrumental in fighting Obamacare nationwide. In 2006 President Bush invited Gossage to serve on an HSA roundtable council.
"It is an honor to be named Chairwoman of Newt's campaign in Kansas.  Newt is the President we need to repeal ObamaCare, reduce gasoline prices to $2.50 a gallon, balance the budget, and restore American exceptionalism," said Gossage.
The campaign effort in Kansas is also aided by a previously announced 12-member legislative leadership team:

State Senator Ray Merrick
State Senator Rob Olson
Former State Senator Peggy Palmer
State Representative Anthony Brown
State Representative Marico Goico
State Representative Trent LeDoux
State Representative Larry Powell
State Representative John Rubin
State Representative Scott Schwab
Former State Representative Bonnie Huy

In charge of the ground game is State Director Mike Pirner. Assisting Mike in the grassroots effort is a large team of political activists and grassroots leaders around the state, including Travis Couture-Lovelady as Assistant State Director and Rhandi Pendergrass as Volunteer Coordinator.
