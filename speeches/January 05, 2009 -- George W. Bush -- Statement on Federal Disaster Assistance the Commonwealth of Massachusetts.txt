    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a severe winter storm and flooding beginning on December 11, 2008, and continuing.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storm and flooding in the counties of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, and Worcester.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Mark H. Landry as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
