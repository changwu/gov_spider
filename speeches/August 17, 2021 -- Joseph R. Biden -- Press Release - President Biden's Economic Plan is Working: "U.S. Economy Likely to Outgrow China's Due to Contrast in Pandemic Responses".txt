    This week, the Wall Street Journal reported on data that the "U.S. gross domestic product rose 12.2% in the second quarter of this year from a year earlier, outpacing China's 7.9% gain."
The Journal quotes Moody's economists who believe that "the American edge should continue for at least the next few quarters," which would make this "the first sustained period since at least 1990 in which the U.S. economy grew faster than China's.
The reporting points to the two nation's respective approaches to combatting the pandemic and stabilizing their economies. The Wall Street Journal writes, "Although the U.S. economy took longer to right itself than China's, the U.S. poured far more resources into a recovery. A combination of vaccinations, massive fiscal stimulus and near-zero interest rates pushed the U.S. ahead of China in GDP growth."
The economy is on the move again because President Biden has focused since day one in office on rebuilding it from the bottom up and the middle out, and setting our nation on a path to long-term recovery and growth.
