Voice Over: "Rudy Giuliani is not endorsed by The Tampa Tribune."
BACKGROUND:
Tampa Tribune Said Giuliani Was "Too Tough For Our Tastes." "Rudy Giuliani marched his way into America's heart when he walked that dusty boulevard to the twin towers after the attacks of 9/11. He became a national hero that day, a leader in a time of crisis. Giuliani's strong resume is attractive to conservatives. He investigated corruption as a U.S. attorney and tackled crime and code enforcement as New York's mayor. His campaign to fight a culture of lawlessness by enforcing even minor laws – like fixing broken windows – is a case study in leadership. But despite his leadership after 9/11 and his turnaround of a crime-ridden city, Giuliani is not the person best positioned to lead America's interests and ideals. … The mayor is a tough-talking New Yorker – a little too tough for our tastes. In a conversation with this editorial board, he said the way to end terrorism is: 'You get rid of the nation states that support it,' opening the door to a host of possibilities."

BACKGROUND:
South Florida Sun-Sentinel Supported McCain Because He Goes Against Republican Party On Key Issues. "The South Florida Sun-Sentinel Editorial Board recommends Republican voters choose Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain offers the right mix of experience and ideological autonomy that should strike a chord with restless voters. No, he's not an outsider, having served in Congress since 1982, including the past 22 years in the U.S. Senate. During that time, however, he carved out a role as an individualist, having supported two pieces of legislation that angered his own party. One was the McCain-Feingold campaign fundraising law. The other was the sensible and practical McCain-Kennedy bill to reform immigration laws, which stalled due to congressional bickering."

The Bush administration would do itself a favor by preparing a postsurge strategy that incorporates more Iraq Study Group recommendations. … Bottom Line: Time's running out.

Voice Over: "… when you fight to appoint conservative federal judges …"
Chyron: "Fought for Conservative Judges"
BACKGROUND:
GIULIANI FOUGHT FOR CONSERVATIVE JUDGES IN REAGAN ADMINISTRATION
Giuliani Was A Member Of The Department Of Justice Judicial Selection Working Group. The group reviewed vacant seats and judicial candidates for the federal courts. In addition, the group dealt with issues such as efforts to obtain names of qualified women candidates for judicial vacancies. (Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Rose, Memo To Department Of Justice Judicial Selection Working Group, 2/1/82; Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Rose, Memo To Department of Justice Judicial Selection Working Group, 4/12/82)
Former Reagan Administration Assistant Attorney General Ted Olson Said Reagan Appointed Judges Like Scalia "On The Recommendation Of Rudy." Olson: "The best indicator is when Rudy was a part of the federal system in the United States Department of Justice in the early 1980's in the Reagan administration. And the people that President Reagan appointed with…on the recommendation of Rudy, among others, were the people like Bob Bork and Justice Scalia, then Judge Scalia, and so forth." (Hugh Hewitt Show, 3/1/07)
Olson Said That Giuliani Made Sure Reagan's Judicial Nominees Respected The Constitution. Olson: "Rudy and I became very, very close, part of that process was the selection of persons to recommend to President Reagan to appoint to judicial positions, including the Supreme Court, the Federal Courts of Appeals, the Federal District Courts. And one of the things we did was concentrate on the character and integrity of the individuals that we wanted to appoint to the judiciary. People would respect the constitution, laws passed by Congress and the limited role of judges." (Ted Olson, Press Conference, Washington, D.C., 7/17/07)
Giuliani Attended Weekly Meetings Devoted To Judicial Selections And Nominations, Would Share His Views On Nominees. "Numerous senior officials who served with him confirm that in addition to daily senior-management meetings with the attorney general, which covered pending nominations, Giuliani attended the Tuesday meetings devoted to judicial selections and nominations. He would present his recommendations for U.S. Attorneys and Marshals but also offer his views on judges." (Jennifer Rubin, "Rudy As Prosecutor," National Review, 4/30/07)
Former Federal Prosecutor Randy Mastro: "Mayor Giuliani Has Said That He Wants To Appoint Judges Who Will Interpret The Law And Who Will Make Policy. He Had Experience Doing That As The Number Three Official In Ronald Reagan's Department." (Randy Mastro, Press Conference, Washington, D.C., 7/17/07)
AND PUSHED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH'S STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST NOMINEES
Giuliani Called John Roberts "Remarkable Candidate" With "Superb Qualifications For The Supreme Court." GIULIANI: "[John Roberts is] a remarkable candidate. I mean, there is nothing in his background that doesn't say 'superb qualifications for the Supreme Court.' His education, his academic performance, the extraordinary fact that he's argued 39 times before the Supreme Court." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 7/20/05)
Giuliani Said Democrats Would "Really Lose Credibility" If They Forcefully Opposed Roberts' Nomination. GIULIANI: "[I] think, if they do an all-out opposition to John Roberts, they're going to really lose credibility, because he is precisely what they've been talking about, someone who is extremely well-qualified, someone who's – because he hasn't been on the court for a long time, someone whose opinions you don't really know completely, but you kind of get a sense of his general philosophy." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 7/20/05)
Giuliani "Joined A Group Of Former U.S. Attorneys In Backing" Alito's Nomination. "Rudy Giuliani, a potential 2008 White House contender, joined a group of former U.S. Attorneys in backing fellow Italian-American Alito for the high court. 'He's a decent human being possessing both the intellect and the temperament to serve on the highest court in the land. He'll make a terrific Supreme Court Justice,' said … Giuliani via spokeswoman Sunny Mindel." (Deborah Orin, "Here Come Da Grudge," New York Post, 1/10/06)

BACKGROUND:
NEW YORK TIMES TAKES VERY LIBERAL POSITIONS
The New York Times Opposed The Iraq War Troop Surge Last Year. "President Bush told Americans last night that failure in Iraq would be a disaster. The disaster is Mr. Bush's war, and he has already failed. Last night was his chance to stop offering more fog and be honest with the nation, and he did not take it. … Mr. Bush did acknowledge that some of his previous tactics had failed. But even then, the president sounded as if he were an accidental tourist in Iraq. He described the failure of last year's effort to pacify Baghdad as if the White House and the Pentagon bore no responsibility. … Mr. Bush did announce his plan for 20,000 more troops, and the White House trumpeted a $1 billion contribution to reconstruction efforts. Congress will debate these as if they are the real issues. But they are not. Talk of a 'surge' ignores the other 132,000 American troops trapped by a failed strategy. … This war has reached the point that merely prolonging it could make a bad ending even worse. Without a real plan to bring it to a close, there is no point in talking about jobs programs and military offensives. There is nothing ahead but even greater disaster in Iraq." (Editorial, "The Real Disaster," The New York Times, 1/11/07)
The New York Times Now Rejects The Success Of The Troop Surge. "We wish [McCain] could now see as clearly past the temporary victories produced by Mr. Bush's unsustainable escalation, which have not led to any change in Iraq's murderous political calculus." (Editorial, "Primary Choices: John McCain," The New York Times, 1/25/08)
The New York Times Criticized Republicans For Opposing "Amnesty" And Offering Border Security Legislation. "Congressional leaders and President Bush insisted for months that they were serious about fixing the immigration system. They weren't, and the more talk you hear about border security, about building walls and getting tough this time, the clearer it will be that hopes for effective immigration reform this year are past saving, pinned down by strong arms in the Republican-controlled House and kicked until dead. … One of the many signs of the hysteria accompanying this election season is the way their moderate approach to immigration has been tarred as wholesale 'amnesty' for lawbreakers. Like the summer hearings, the latest G.O.P. legislation is an empty vessel, a sham product aimed at the November elections that sells the test-marketed concept of 'security' with little to back it up. By decreeing that a 700-mile fence should be the nation's top immigration priority while rabidly opposing a path to legal status for illegal immigrants, the House Republicans are hotly pursing a failed strategy. What satisfies the talk-radio appetite for justice — wall 'em out and deport the rest — is not just needlessly cruel. It also won't work." (Editorial, "Immigration's Lost Year," The New York Times, 9/19/06)
The New York Times Praised Passage Of Campaign Finance Reform Legislation, Calling It "A Victory For All Americans." "When the moment finally arrived yesterday for the Senate to consider the bill known alternately as Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold, it passed so easily you would hardly know what the fuss had been about. Yet approval of the biggest election reform in a generation, by a vote to 60 to 40, had just overcome what seemed only six months ago to be impossible odds. Congratulations were heard, and merited, all across the Capitol. … Senators McCain and Feingold joined yesterday with Representatives Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan to rejoice in victory. But they also made a welcome vow to keep fighting for reform, a cause that was awfully lonely seven years ago and has seen its obituary written many times since then. They and their allies savored a great victory yesterday. It was a victory for all Americans." (Editorial, "An Extraordinary Victory," The New York Times, 3/21/02)
