PAUL RYAN: "In 2008, President Obama made lots of grandiose promises. You remember hope and change? Remember how he would bring everybody together? He hasn't met with our party leaders since last July. Remember when he said he would cut the deficit in half? It has doubled. Remember when he said he would create all of these jobs? Look, we just got the latest employment report. And the unemployment rate is higher than the day he took office. You have got 23 million Americans struggling to find work in this country today. 15% of our fellow citizens are living in poverty today. It is the highest rate in a generation. We are nine million jobs shy of what he said we would achieve if only he could borrow all that stimulus money and spend it on all of these interest groups. Look, this isn't working. We have a jobs crisis. Wouldn't it be nice to have an actual job creator in the White House during a jobs crisis? We need leadership."
