    President Bush. It's such an honor to be with President and Mrs. Ford. The country has produced a lot of fine citizens, and there's no two finer people than these two. Thank you for your hospitality, sir.
Former President Ford. We solved all the problems, didn't we? [Laughter]
President Bush. That's right; we sure did.
Former President Ford. Well, thank you for stopping by, George.
President Bush. God bless you.
Former President Ford. Same to you, sir.
