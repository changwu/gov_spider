    The death of Robert Kennedy, 10 years ago today, was a terrible blow to the people of this Nation and the world. As a champion of the poor, of the victims of injustice, and of reconciliation and peace, he was an apostle and a symbol of hope. He felt deeply, and aroused deep feelings. He is still mourned, and be is remembered as he was: passionate, moral, committed, spontaneous, joyful.
