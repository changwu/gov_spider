    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 3/15/94)(House)(Bingaman (D) NM and Domenici (R) NM)
The Administration supports S. 375.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 375 could affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
