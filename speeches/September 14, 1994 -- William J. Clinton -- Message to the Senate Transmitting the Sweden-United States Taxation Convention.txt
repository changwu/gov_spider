    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Sweden for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income signed at Stockholm on September 1, 1994, together with a related exchange of notes. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The proposed Convention with Sweden replaces the present income tax regime between the two countries. In general, the proposed Convention follows the pattern of other recent U.S. income tax treaties and the 1981 U.S. Model Income Tax Convention, as well as the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and the related exchange of notes and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

September 14, 1994.
