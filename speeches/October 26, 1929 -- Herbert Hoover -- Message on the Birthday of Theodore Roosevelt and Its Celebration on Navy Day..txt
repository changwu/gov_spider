    THE BIRTHDAY of Theodore Roosevelt annually brings a reminder of the driving power of stalwart character and vigorous ideals. These were embodied in his person, and they gave force and substance to the distinctive charm with which he projected his virile personality upon our national life. His contributions to our history are many, not the least being his labors in upbuilding the Navy, which has chosen his [p.358] birthday as the occasion for yearly commemoration of its services to country. Americans should make the anniversary of this great American's birth an occasion of general and public appreciation of his life.
