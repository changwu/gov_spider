    While it is good news for his family, the resignation of DNC National Chairman Steve Grossman is a loss for the Democratic Party. Steve has been a leader, a party builder, a prolific fundraiser, and a wonderful friend to Hillary and me.
When Steve became national chairman in early 1997, the Democratic Party faced an enormous debt and the possibility that we would not have the financial resources to compete effectively in the midterm election. With Steve's energy and dedication, the party has nearly eliminated its debt, and we had the resources we needed to compete in November.
Steve and our general chairman, Governor Roy Romer, have made a remarkable team. The millions of voters mobilized under their leadership led to the extraordinary and historic successes of Democratic candidates nationwide.
Steve's life has been dedicated to public service, his community, and his faith. I will always be grateful to him for his service to our party and the Nation. Hillary and I wish the best to Steve, his wife, Barbara, and their sons, David, Benjamin, and Joshua.
