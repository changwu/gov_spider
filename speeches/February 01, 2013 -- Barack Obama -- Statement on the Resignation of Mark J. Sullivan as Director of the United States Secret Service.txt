    I want to thank Mark Sullivan for nearly 30 years of service to our Nation at the United States Secret Service, a tenure that saw the agency protect five First Families, including my own. Mark started out in the Detroit field office before joining the Presidential Protective Division. And since 2006, as Director, Mark has led the agency with incredible dedication and integrity. The Secret Service is best known for protecting our Nation's leaders, but every day they also protect the American people. From securing large events such as Presidential Inaugurations to safeguarding our financial system, the men and women of the agency perform their mission with professionalism and dedication. That is a testament to Mark and his steadfast leadership, which will be missed. Michelle and I wish him all the best.
