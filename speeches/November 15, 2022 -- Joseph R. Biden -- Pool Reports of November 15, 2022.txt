Travel pool 4 - negative test
COVID update, per WH: "The President tested negative this morning and is not considered a close contact as defined by the CDC."
Pool will inquire as to the type of test.
Motorcade rolled through residential areas en route to the site, arriving at the site and pausing at 10 am. It's not entirely clear if we're still in the motorcade, as we're at a complete stop with view blocked.
Small groups of people dotted the roadway, usually with police and black beret wearing local community watch groups keeping an eye. Many were snapping cell phone pics.
The route was lined with decorations made from coconut leaves, called penjor.
Thanks to co-poolers Jim Tankersley and Patsy Widakuswara for the continued assist!

November 15, 202216:18 WITA

Travel pool 8 - pool moving
Pool is relocating to the G20 site in the Kenpinski, as if 4:16.
This comes after a long lull in the hold, punctuated by a triple monkey sighting on the way to vans.



November 15, 202216:47 WITA

Travel pool 9 - inside
Pool made it inside after a messy scrum about 4:40. Security was very tight and people from other delegations were yelling to get in
Co pooler caught Trump posing with Indian PM Modi. Looks like they flashed peace signs.
Fellow pooler asked Biden about his reported meeting with Turkey's Erdogan. He didn't respond, but appeared to hear.
Later we saw him interact with Van ser Leyen.
Potus is now seated at head of table.
Thanks to Seung Min Kim of AP for the fill!



November 15, 202216:53 WITA

Travel pool 9 fix
One fix on prior report: your pooler accidentally typed the name of a former president who is also having a big day.
It was Biden with Modi.
Potus has started remarks on infrastructure.



November 15, 202217:15 WITA

Travel pool 10 - Potus remarks
Pool is expecting a readout of what is being called an unplanned pull-aside with Erdogan, as has been reported in Turkish media.
In his remarks, Potus spoke about a range of investments by US and multilateral institutions around the world.
Biden ticked through investments announced previously by a group formed by the Group of 7 nations, widely seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road program. "I want to emphasize the word 'investments'," he said.
He then announced the Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia (the White House has released a fact sheet), which seeks to mobilize $20 billion in public and private money "to support Indonesia's efforts to reduce emissions" and transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy
Yellen and Blinken sat behind him, nodding along.
Also speaking were Van der Leyen and Japanese PM Kishida, who spoke about a series of Japanese investments, including geothermal projects.
Pool is leaving after the PM while Trudeau is speaking.
Thanks again to Tankersley.
Per the WH:
The President is co-hosting an event with President Widodo of Indonesia and President Von der Leyen of the European Commission on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment which aims to mobilize $600 billion in the next five years with G7 partners to deliver sustainable infrastructure and advance U.S national security and economic security interests. In attendance are:

Travel pool 11 - Readout, pool standing
You may have seen the WH just sent a readout of the pull-aside with Erdogan, copied here.
Pool has spotted Modi and Scholz, up close but with no info.
Pool is now standing out front likely soon moving to vans.
Readout of President Biden's Meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkiye
President Biden met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the margins of the G20 Summit. President Biden expressed his deep condolences to President Erdogan and the people of Turkiye on the acts of violence in Istanbul and made clear we stand with our NATO Ally. President Biden expressed his appreciation to President Erdogan for his efforts to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which they both agreed has been critical to improving global food security amid Russia's war and that the Initiative must continue. The two also discussed continued close coordination on NATO Alliance issues, and other issues of regional and global concern.

Travel pool 12 update: more waiting
Pool continues to wait with the motorcade.

Travel pool 14 - early lid
Motorcade rolled back to the RON and immediately got a lid after Potus split off.
Potus had been scheduled to attend a dinner and cultural event. Pool has sought guidance on why he evidently decided not to attend. Will send along any updates on that.
Thanks again to copooler Jim Tankersley and local expert Patsy W.
Good night all!



November 15, 202220:46 WITA

Travel pool 15 - re early lid
Pool reached out to an administration official, who responded by way of background:
"It's not COVID. He just had spent a full day in meetings and needed to attend to a few things tonight (nothing urgent!). He spoke to Widodo to send his regrets about missing the dinner and Widodo said it was not an issue and P looks forward to seeing him at the mangrove thing tomorrow."
Gnite all



November 15, 202222:59 WITA
