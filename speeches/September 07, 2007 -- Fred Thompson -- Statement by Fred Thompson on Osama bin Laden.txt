    Mason City, IA - Senator Fred Thompson made the following remarks while campaigning at the Music Man Square in Mason City, IA:
"Apparently, Osama bin Laden has crawled out of his cave long enough to send another video, and he is getting a lot of attention and ought to be caught and killed.
"We also need to understand that when he is caught and killed, somebody will replace him.
"We like to personalize things in this country, sometimes a little too much. Somebody will replace him. He represents the fact that we are in a global conflict and are going to be for some time.
"The most important part of how we deal with that has to deal with the resolution of the American people and political leaders."
