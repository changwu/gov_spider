    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on District of Columbia v. Heller:
"Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on District of Columbia v. Heller,a landmark case for all Americans who believe as I do that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms. I am proud to have joined in an amicus brief to the Court calling for a ruling in keeping with the clear intent of our Founding Fathers, which ensures the Second Amendment rights of the residents of District of Columbia are reaffirmed."
