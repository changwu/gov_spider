    John Ashbrook was a man of courage and principle. He served his constituents and his country with dedication and devotion, always working toward the betterment of his fellow man. His patriotism and deep belief in the greatness of America never wavered, and his articulate and passionate calls for a return to old-fashioned American values earned him the respect of all who knew him.
I valued John Ashbrook's friendship and will miss his wise counsel. Nancy and I join in sending our deepest sympathy to John's family.
