    GENERAL Westmoreland is not the only hero of Vietnam that's with us this afternoon. Nor is he the only high-ranking officer present.
We also have a colonel in the Marine Corps, and a lieutenant colonel in the Army's Green Berets. As a matter of fact, they are one and the same person. And although the ranks are honorary, they are very richly deserved. They are held by Miss Martha Raye.
Miss Raye has been to Vietnam three times. She has spent many long months there. She has entertained our troops on the firing lines. The Green Berets have made her the only person outside this very elite corps who may wear their proud symbol.
One night in the Delta, I am told, Miss Raye was to entertain the men of two helicopter units. But they ran into very heavy fighting that day, and as Miss Raye arrived for the entertainment she found the wounded pouring into a little dispensary.
Miss Raye is a former nurse. So without any hesitation, she put on Army fatigues, administered blood, and prepared the wounded for surgery. The show didn't go on that night, but, as the Army Digest wrote later, "Those who benefited from her nursing care remember a Martha Raye performance that no stage show could ever duplicate."
General Westmoreland and the men that he speaks for are very anxious to have her back in Vietnam. But just now I am proud to present a great artist and a great American to all of you: Martha Raye.
