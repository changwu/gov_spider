(House)(Hyde (R) Illinois and 2 cosponsors)
Though the Administration prefers adoption of the Conference Report H.R. 2977, the Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4194. We will seek an amendment in the Senate, however, to divest District Courts of jurisdiction over government contract bid protests and to vest this authority exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. This amendment would eliminate disparate bodies of law and incentives for excessive litigation. With nationwide jurisdiction, contract expertise, and the ability to hold hearings at a venue convenient to litigants (including small businesses), the Court of Federal Claims could establish a consistent body of precedent governing bid protests.
