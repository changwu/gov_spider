    The Hawaii Legislature did the right thing for their workers by taking action to increase their State's minimum wage to $10.10. I commend the State legislature and look forward to Governor Abercrombie signing the bill into law soon. Hawaii joins a large and growing coalition of States, cities, counties, and businesses that have given their citizens and employees the raise they deserve. This important step in Hawaii is yet another sign that the American people support raising the minimum wage, and I urge Republicans in Congress to follow Hawaii's lead and lift wages for 28 million Americans. With a Senate vote on this crucial issue planned for today, it's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the majority of Americans who say it's time to give America a raise.
