    I applaud the strong vote of the United Nations General Assembly today urging countries to ban all forms of human cloning. I am also grateful for the strong statement against practices that exploit women.
Human life must not be created for the purpose of destroying it. The United States and the international community have now spoken clearly that human cloning is an affront to human dignity and that we must work together to protect human life. I look forward to working with Members of Congress to enact legislation to ban all human cloning in the United States.
