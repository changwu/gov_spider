    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a Second Protocol, signed at Washington on March 28, 1984, Amending the Convention between the United States and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, signed at Washington on September 26, 1980, as amended by a Protocol signed at Ottawa on June 14, 1983. I also transmit the report of the Department of State with respect to the second protocol.
The Social Security Amendments of 1983 were enacted since the negotiation of the convention and first protocol. They provide in part that social security benefits paid to nonresident aliens henceforth will be subject to an effective 15 percent withholding tax. The Canadian Government has requested that the pending convention be amended to exempt Canadian residents from such withholding.
The second protocol would amend Article XVIII (Pensions and Annuities) of the convention, so as to provide that social security benefits paid by one party to residents of the other "shall be taxable only in that other State." However, United States citizens resident in Canada will continue to be taxable to the extent provided under United States law.
It is most desirable that this second protocol, together with the convention and first protocol, be considered by the Senate as soon as possible and that the Senate give advice and consent to ratification of the convention and two amending protocols.
