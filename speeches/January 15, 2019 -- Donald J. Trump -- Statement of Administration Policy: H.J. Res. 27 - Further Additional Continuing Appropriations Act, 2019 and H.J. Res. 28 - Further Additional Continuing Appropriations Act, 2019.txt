    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lowey, D-NY)
The Administration opposes H.J. Res. 27, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, making further continuing appropriations through February 1, 2019, and H.J. Res. 28, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, making further continuing appropriations through February 28, 2019.
The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen agencies affected by lapsed appropriations, but any effort to do so must address the security and humanitarian crisis on our Southwest border and should restore funding for all agencies affected by the lapse.
For fiscal year 2019, the Administration has clearly and repeatedly communicated the requirements for border security, including through a recent letter from the Office of Management and Budget to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on January 6, 2019.
Presenting these, or similar bills, to the President without a broader agreement to address the border crisis is unacceptable. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations legislation that adequately addresses the crisis on our Southwest border and reopens the Federal Government for the American people as soon as possible.
If H.J. Res. 27, H.J. Res. 28, or any similar continuing resolution were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
