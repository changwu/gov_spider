    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) Massachusetts)
The administration opposes S. 1542, because it would authorize a new unbudgeted Federal demonstration program for intensive and comprehensive supportive services for low-income children from birth to compulsory school age, including comprehensive services for parents and other family members. The bill would duplicate services currently provided under existing authority, including parent-child centers and migrant head start centers funded under the Head Start Act, and services under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Act.
