    Americans have a long tradition of conservation and stewardship of our Nation's lands and other natural resources. It was this ethic that led 30 years ago to passage of landmark legislation that continues to help improve America's water and air quality. Over the last three decades, we have made remarkable progress, working together to meet our conservation goals and improve the quality of our air and water.
Today I have directed the Federal agencies that oversee environmental and natural resource policies and programs to promote cooperative conservation in full partnership with States, local governments, tribes, and individuals. Local involvement is critical to ensuring successful, effective, and long-lasting conservation results. The Executive order on cooperative conservation that I have signed today will help us continue to make sure that decisions in Washington, DC, are well-informed by those closest to the land and their communities.
