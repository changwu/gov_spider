    Biden's announcement that he was taking down his negative ads was a hoax.
Despite the Biden campaign's announcement on Friday that they would suspend all attack ads while President Trump is fighting off the coronavirus at Walter Reed Medical Center, dozens upon dozens of TV ads attacking the president are still airing around the country two days later. Nearly 100 TV ads attacking the President have aired so far today, including on channels in Pennsylvania, Maine, Arizona, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Florida. 
The day after SNL's host declared "my heart goes out to COVID," a Biden ad is telling voters "this is our chance to put the darkness of the past four years behind us."
A Biden spokesman made it clear on Saturday that the Biden campaign had no intention of keeping their word. Biden himself didn't even follow his own guidance on the campaign trail Saturday, attacking the president as "despicable" just moments after saying he didn't want to criticize him.
It's simple: the Biden campaign successfully tricked reporters into thinking they're the "good guys" and scored some good headlines and tweets while doing nothing to tone down their viciousness and dishonesty. They lied to the media and got caught. Will these ads ever be coming down? Or did the Biden campaign pull off another hoax?
