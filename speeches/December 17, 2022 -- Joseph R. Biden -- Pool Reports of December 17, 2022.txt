Out of town pool report #1 / gathering and OTR
After being tested, swept, and assembled, the pool joined the motorcade near POTUS’ residence at 11:23am.
We are en route to an as yet unclear destination for an OTR stop. Stay tuned.

Out of town pool report #2 / shopping
After a brief 5 minute drive, we arrived at a strip mall nearby, one that includes banks, a deli, and a salon and spa.
POTUS got out of the car but the pool didn't have a great view of where he stopped first (there was a jewelry store and a bakery in the vicinity). About 10 minutes later, he emerged from that area of the shopping center and could then be clearly spotted as he walked into Jacques Ferber, which on its website says it offers "the finest in luxury outerwear." He was only there for about two minutes.
Then he walked a few doors down to Jos A Bank, past the pool standing about 30 feet away (he didn't acknowledge shouted questions about Title 42 as he passed). POTUS did not appear to have any shopping bags but the man next to him did.
Customers were swept as they entered Jos A Bank to apparently do some holiday clothing shopping with the president.
Pool remained outside in the parking lot and at 11:59am POTUS emerged with what seemed like a small black bag.
Motorcade now rolling again.

Out of town pool report #3 / POTUS back home
With a short 5 minute motorcade ride back, pool dropped POTUS off at his residence at 12:05pm.
Pool is still in the area and will pass along additional guidance or movements as it comes.



December 17, 202212:31

Out of town pool report #4 / lid until 3:30pm
We have a lunch lid until 3:30pm

Out of town pool report #5 / rolling
Pool has been reassembled and reswept, and at 3:32pm we joined the motorcade as POTUS departed his neighborhood.
Now rolling into the streets of Wilmington.

Out of town pool report #6 / Fieldstone Golf Club
Motorcade arrived at Fieldstone Golf Club at 3:40pm, at which point POTUS’ portion of the motorcade went up the drive toward the club and the pool van briefly diverted. There was no sighting of POTUS but there was a sighting of several deer in the woods.
Regular pool report readers will note that Fieldstone is where POTUS at times goes golfing. With a 40-degree temperature and the sun setting in about an hour, the clubhouse may be a better bet.
No details at the moment on who POTUS is with or what he’s doing.
Pool van is now holding somewhat nearby the entrance of the club.

Out of town pool report #7 / rolling (again)
After a brief, 20-minute stop at Fieldstone Gold Club, the motorcade left at 4pm and is now rolling again.



December 17, 202216:27

Out of town pool report #8 / back at residence
After an uneventful ride POTUS is back at his residence.
Pool is holding nearby, ready for any additional movements.



December 17, 202216:54

Out of town pool report #9 / rolling
Motorcade now rolling out of POTUS’ neighborhood, with pool joining at 4:51pm.



December 17, 202217:03

Out of town pool report #10 / church
POTUS arrived at St Joseph’s on the Brandywine Church at 4:54pm.
Pool caught a brief glimpse of him walking toward the church doors, and the White House says he is accompanied by the First Lady and that they are attending mass.



December 17, 202218:05

Out of town pool report #11 / church over and lid
POTUS emerged from church at 5:47pm, and at his side was his sister, Valerie. He slowly walked toward his car joined by others, including FLOTUS. The dark lighting made it hard to identify who he was with, but he stopped to talk with two people just before getting into his car.
A sad reminder that POTUS’ wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi are buried in the church’s cemetery, and tomorrow marks 50 years after they were killed in an accident while out shopping for a Christmas tree.
Motorcade was quick and dropped POTUS at his house at 5:57pm.
A minute later a lid was called.
