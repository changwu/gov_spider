    Biden-Harris Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board Co-chair Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith and board member Dr. Robert Rodriguez met with Latino and immigrant workers and providers to hear directly from individuals who have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The roundtable included an early educator, a farm worker, the Executive Director of Servicios de la Raza, and the Chairman of the Board of SOMOS Community Care. The discussion focused on the challenges of working on the frontlines of the pandemic, providing support for families, and the increase in hospitalization rates. Dr. Nunez-Smith and Dr. Rodriguez reaffirmed the president-elect and vice president-elect's commitment to addressing the disproportionate impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in communities of color.
This meeting was part of the COVID-19 Advisory Board's continued engagement with stakeholders, including health care and frontline workers.
