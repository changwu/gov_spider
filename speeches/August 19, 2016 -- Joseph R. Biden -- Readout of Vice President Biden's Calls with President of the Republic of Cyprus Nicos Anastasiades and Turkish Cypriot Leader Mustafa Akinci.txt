    The Vice President spoke over the phone today to President of the Republic of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades and subsequently to Turkish Cypriot Leader Mustafa Akinci. The Vice President congratulated the leaders on the progress they have made so far in the negotiations towards a settlement that would reunify Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation. The Vice President expressed hope that the leaders would be able to make significant additional progress in the talks before their travel to the United Nations General Assembly, and that an agreement could be reached by the end of 2016.
