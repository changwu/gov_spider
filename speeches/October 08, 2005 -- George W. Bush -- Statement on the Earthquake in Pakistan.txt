    The people of the United States offer our deepest sympathies for the loss of life and destruction caused by the earthquake that struck outside of Islamabad. Our initial deployments of assistance are underway, and we stand ready to provide additional assistance as needed. My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible tragedy.
