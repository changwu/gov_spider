    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes, flooding, mudslides, and landslides during the period of April 3-4, 2008.
Federal funding is available to Commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes, flooding, mudslides, and landslides in the counties of Anderson, Crittenden, Fleming, Fulton, Hancock, Hopkins, Lewis, Livingston, McLean, Nicholas, Ohio, Spencer, and Woodford.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the entire Commonwealth.
