    Florida Lieutenant Governor Jennifer Carroll today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks to the NAACP convention:
"President Obama's policies are failing us. The African American unemployment rate increased by almost an entire percentage point last month and, at 14.4 percent, it is almost double that of the nation's overall unemployment rate. This is simply unacceptable. We cannot settle for another month of nearly non-existent job creation. President Obama's policies have made a bad situation worse for struggling African American families. Fortunately, we can put a stop to these job-killing policies by electing Mitt Romney. Governor Romney understands and knows what it takes to create a favorable environment for job creation, and with his pro-growth agenda, Mitt Romney will steer our country back in the right direction and this direction will help restore prosperity for African American families."
