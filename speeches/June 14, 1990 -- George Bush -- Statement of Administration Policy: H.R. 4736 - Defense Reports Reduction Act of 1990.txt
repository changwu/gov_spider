    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Aspin (D) Wisconsin and 17 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4736, but will work in the Senate to delete the provision repealing section 602(c) of the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. The repeal of section 602(c) could inadvertently reinstate certain defense reporting requirements.
