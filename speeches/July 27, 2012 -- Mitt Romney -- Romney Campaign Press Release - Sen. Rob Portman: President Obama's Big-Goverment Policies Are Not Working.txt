    Ohio Senator Rob Portman today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"Today's disappointing economic growth number is yet another reminder that the economy is weakening at a time when so many families in Ohio and across the country are already struggling in the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression. Despite a string of bad economic reports, President Obama refuses to change course. He must know that his economic plan of more spending, bigger government and class warfare and anti-business campaign rhetoric is not working to bring back jobs."
