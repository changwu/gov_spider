As president, Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth policies that create 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for middle-class families." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

An Associated Press analysis shows that by just about any measure, the one that began in June 2009 is the weakest.
