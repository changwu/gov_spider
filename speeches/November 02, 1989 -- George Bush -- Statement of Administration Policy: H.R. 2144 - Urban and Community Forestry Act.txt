    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jontz (D) IN and 23 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2144. The Administration will seek changes in the Senate, however, to clarify that the reports and action plans of a proposed advisory council would be subject to review and revision by the Secretary of Agriculture. Such a review requirement would avoid any infringement of the President's authority as head of the unitary Executive branch.
