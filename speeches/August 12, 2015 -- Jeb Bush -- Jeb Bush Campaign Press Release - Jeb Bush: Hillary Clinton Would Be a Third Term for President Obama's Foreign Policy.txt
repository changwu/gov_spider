"I would say that...if you want a third term of Barack Obama's, you're going to get it. Because she was there when all of this took place. And, you know, you can take loyalty up to a certain amount, but she was there making these decisions. She pushed that reset button with Russia and it didn't work out; she was responsible for the Libyan policy that was an abject failure; she, along with President Obama, could have signed the forces agreement between Iraq and the United States that would have created stability and not allowed ISIS to exist. She was — she was there with the red line in Syria that created such problems for the United States around the world. This presidency has failed in terms of its foreign policy and she will — she will — this is her — what she's touting, that she has the experience of being Secretary of State."
