    I AM gratified by the rapid response on this crucial measure by the Congress prior to their Easter recess. The provisions for preventive health activities and summer youth employment programs are identical to my request.
The special supplemental appropriations contained in this measure are essential for implementation of the national influenza immunization program. This program is designed to protect Americans against a swine-type strain of virus which was responsible for thousands of deaths in the United States during 1918-19.
The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, David Mathews, and the Department are moving ahead rapidly to implement the program objectives that will assure the availability of the vaccine to all citizens before the end of the year.
The same spirit of cooperation that was exhibited by the Congress must now characterize the rest of this program if we are to be successful. The pledges of active support that have already been made by members of the medical profession, major health organizations and associations, civic groups, elected officials, and individual citizens have been heartwarming. They assure me that the job can be done.
I intend to give this program my direct attention and my full support because the health of our Nation is at stake. I urge every American to receive an inoculation against this form of influenza, and I urge everyone to support this program in their own community.
