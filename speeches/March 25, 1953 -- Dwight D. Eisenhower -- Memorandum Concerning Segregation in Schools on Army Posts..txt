    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense Subject:
- Segregation in Schools on Army Posts
At my request, following last week's news conference a memorandum addressed to my Press Secretary was received from the Secretary of the Army relative to the above subject.
(1) It states that by the opening of the school term next Fall all schools operated by the Army under provisions of Section 6 of Public Law 874 will be on a completely integrated basis. Consequently, the process of integration is almost completed, but in any event will be concluded prior to the opening of the schools next September.
(2) The memorandum likewise discusses the operation of schools by state authorities on Federally-owned property under the provisions of Section 3 of Public Law 874. Since these schools are operated with State funds but on Federal property and in Federally-owned buildings, complicating factors are present.
The Secretary of the Army's memorandum indicates that the Army commanders are in the process of making a survey relative to this question designed to bring about agreement with local authorities for integrating the schools. If such integration is not achieved, other arrangements in these instances will be considered.
