    Biden recognized what dozens of other Democrats knew at the time — welfare without work requirements just wasn't working. As president, Mitt Romney will immediately restore the bipartisan Clinton-era welfare reforms and get Americans back to work." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
For More Than Two Decades, Vice President Biden Has Supported Work Requirements For Welfare Recipients:
In 1987, Senator Joe Biden Proposed Changes To Welfare That Required Individuals "Either To Work Or Participate In Some Form Of Job Training." "'It should have been no surprise that taxpayers would become resentful of the way that we not so much spend on poverty in this country as much as we finance it,' Biden said. To alleviate that problem, in part, he called for changing welfare regulations to require all mothers, except those with 'very young' children, either to work or participate in some form of job training." (Robert Shogan, "Biden Would Ease 'Awesome Sinkhole' Of Child Poverty," Los Angeles Times, 5/23/87)
In 1996, Senator Biden Boasted About Introducing A "Concept Of Workfare In 1986" For Which He Was "Pilloried" By Fellow Democrats. BIDEN: "I introduced a concept of workfare in 1986. I remember being pilloried by my colleagues on the Democratic side at the time for suggesting that there by mandatory work requirements for anyone receiving welfare." (Sen. Joe Biden, U.S. Senate, 7/18/96)

Senator Biden, In 1996: "Since 1987, When I First Proposed An Overhaul Of The Welfare System, I Have Argued That Welfare Recipients Should Be Required To Work." "Since 1987, when I first proposed an overhaul of the welfare system, I have argued that welfare recipients should be required to work.

Senator Carl Levin: "Why Should An Able-Bodied Person Receiving Welfare Benefits Not Be Required To Work For 2 Years?" LEVIN: "The bill before us requires welfare recipients to work within 2 years of the receipt of benefits-2 years. The question is, why wait 2 years?

Senator Russ Feingold: "The Current System Is Plagued By Perverse Incentives That Discourage Work." "Feingold said the legislation would offer states the opportunity to develop approaches to help welfare recipients and their families to become economically self-sufficient. 'The current system is plagued by perverse incentives that discourage work,' he said. 'Reforming such a complex system requires taking some risks, and this bill, any welfare reform measure, entails some risks. However, some assumption of risk is necessary to change the status quo.'" (Frank A. Aukofer, "Senate Passes Welfare Bill," Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, 7/24/96)
Senator Joe Lieberman: "First And Foremost, It Eliminates The Possibility Of Receiving Public Assistance Without Any Intention Of Making Some Kind Of A Contribution To Society In Return."  LIEBERMAN: "First and foremost, it eliminates the possibility of receiving public assistance without any intention of making some kind of a contribution to society in return. Beneficiaries will be aware that from the day they receive their first check, the clock will be ticking. Society is fulfilling an obligations to help them get back on their feet, and they in turn are obligated to make every effort to receive job training or education and to find employment."

But It's Clear Who Won The Policy Fight In The White House — President Obama "Gutted" Welfare Reform By Removing Work Requirements:
The Obama Administration's Welfare Changes "Quietly Opened The Door For States To Seek Major Changes" In Work Requirements. "The Obama administration has quietly opened the door for states to seek major changes in how they meet federal welfare-to-work requirements for some of their poorest residents, and leading conservatives are crying foul." ("Obama Administration Opens The Door For States To Seek Major Changes In Welfare-To-Work Law," The Associated Press, 7/13/12)

"Sebelius's HHS Bureaucracy Declared The Existing TANF Law A Blank Slate On Which It Can Write Any Policy It Chooses." "The Obama administration claims authority to overhaul every aspect of the TANF work provisions (section 407), including 'definitions of work activities and engagement, specified limitations, verification procedures and the calculation of participation rates' — in other words, the whole work program. Sebelius's HHS bureaucracy declared the existing TANF law a blank slate on which it can write any policy it chooses." (Robert Rector, "Obama's Attack On 'Workfare'," National Review, 8/8/12)
Detroit News: President Obama "Tossed Out The Clinton-Era Welfare Reform That Required Able-Bodied Aid Recipients To Work." "Democrats and Republicans alike should be distressed by President Barack Obama's disregard for constitutional limits on his authority. The president's flouting of the separation of powers risks turning this country into something other than a representative democracy. Congress should move in a bipartisan rebuke of Obama's overreach before he neuters that institution. In a blatant challenge to the legislative branch, Obama by executive order tossed out the Clinton-era welfare reform that required able-bodied aid recipients to work, saying the federal government will no longer enforce the law." (Editorial, "Obama's Power Grab Flouts Constitution," Detroit News, 8/6/12)
The Washington Examiner: "With An Official Policy Directive, Obama Gutted President Clinton's 1996 Bipartisan Welfare Reform By Removing The Federal Requirement That Those On Welfare Either Work Or Train For Work."
