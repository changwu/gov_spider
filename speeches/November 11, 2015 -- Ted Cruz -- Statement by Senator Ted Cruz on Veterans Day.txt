    HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement in observance of Veterans Day:
"We owe America's veterans a debt we can never repay.
"Your service has guaranteed our freedom. Your sacrifice has preserved our way of life. Because of you, America continues to shine brightly as a beacon of freedom across the globe – just as she has since 1776. And future generations of service men and women will courageously carry on that torch.
"Please join me this Veterans Day in giving special thanks to all the veterans in our lives and to all those who wear the uniform today.
"May God continue to bless the United States of America and may he also bless all the veterans who have kept us free."
