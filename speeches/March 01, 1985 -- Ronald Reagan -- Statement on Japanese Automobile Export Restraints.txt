    I have today concluded a review of a number of elements of the U.S.-Japan trade relationship, including Japanese restraints on the export of its automobiles and other market access issues. I have concluded this review believing in the wisdom of maintaining the principle of free and fair trade for the benefit of the world's consumers, and I will continue to actively support further liberalization of the global trading system.
In this context, it is my decision not to urge the Japanese to extend their voluntary export restraints on automobiles to the United States. I take this position in the spirit of the common understanding reached between me and Prime Minister Nakasone during our January 2 meetings in Los Angeles. As a separate matter, I would like to commend the improved performance of our own automobile manufacturers. In taking this action, I hope that we can look forward to reciprocal treatment by Japan concerning the high-level discussions underway between our countries in the weeks and months ahead.
