    Kasich for America announced today that Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson will chair and lead the campaign's Wisconsin efforts.
"Gov. Kasich is the dedicated, responsible and compassionate executive leader our country needs. I look forward to him winning Ohio on Tuesday and campaigning in the Badger State with momentum," Gov. Thompson said. "America needs the pro-growth, conservative solutions John Kasich successfully advanced in his home state. Gov. Kasich is the only day one job-ready candidate in the race. He will be a strong, uplifting voice for our country in the White House."

Republican Tommy Thompson was a four-term governor in Wisconsin. He also served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush.
"Governor Thompson exemplifies what every governor should beâ€” a listener, a leader and a reformer," Gov. Kasich said. "I am thankful for his endorsement and willingness to lead our campaign in Wisconsin. I look forward to seeing him on the campaign trail soon."
