    Today, Biden for President released a new ad in several key battleground states to reassure voters that their frustrations regarding police violence and racial injustices are not being taken lightly by Vice President Biden and Sen. Harris.
The 60-second ad, "We're Listening," begins airing today digitally in Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and will begin airing this weekend on national cable channels and top battleground markets. The new creative features a series of recent remarks given by the Vice President and Sen. Harris that focus on creating a more just society for Black Americans. Joe and Kamala's remarks speak directly to the harsh realities Black communities are facing, while both acknowledging that Black Americans should be free to live without fear of law enforcement and unwarranted oversight.
"We can't turn away. Now is the time for racial justice," Biden said during the ad. "I believe with every fiber in my being we have such an opportunity now to change people's lives for the better."
"Part of the point of freedom," Sen. Harris said, "is to be free from brutality. Free from injustice. Free from racism and all of its manifestations."
