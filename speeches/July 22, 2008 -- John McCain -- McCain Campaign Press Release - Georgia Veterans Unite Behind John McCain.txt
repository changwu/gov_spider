    U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Georgia Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Georgia's veterans' community.
"As a 22-year veteran of the Navy and former POW, John McCain has the leadership, judgment and experience to defend and lead our country in these difficult times," said Chris Edenfield, a retired Air Force Captain and Iraq war veteran.
Today's announcement occurs in conjunction with Veterans for McCain rallies in Augusta, Savannah, Smyrna, Warner Robins and throughout the country.
