As tonight's debate started, Marco Rubio is demonstrating once again that he's the only candidate who can lay out specific policies to solve the problems we're facing in the 21st Century.
From reforming the H1-B Visa Program, to fixing Social Security and bringing jobs back to the United States, Marco shined on the issues.

Don't take our word for it. Here's what everyone else is saying:
The difference in substance between Rubio and Trump on SocSec is staggering.

Really strong answer by Rubio on the budget gap not being closed by waste, fraud & abuse & foreign aid.

Strong, strong answer by Rubio here. #GOPDebate

Rubio ran on entitlement reform in 2010 — challenging the GOP establishment, which advised strongly against it. Knows the issue. #GOPdebate

Rubio says "the numbers don't add up" on Trump's entitlement plan. Trump declines to hit back.

Rubio maybe the best messenger in the GOP on entitlements. Won in Florida in 2010 running on that message when party said run away from Ryan

This is a totally substantive debate so far, and Trump has been exposed as knowing very little about anything. His campaign is over, folks.

Rubio stood for brassy entitlement reform all the way back when he ran for Senate—when it was still taboo. #GOPDebate
