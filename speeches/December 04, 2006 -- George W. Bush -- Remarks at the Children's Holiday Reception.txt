    Thanks for coming. Laura and I want to welcome you all to the White House. We're really happy you're here. I think you're going to really enjoy this special occasion. My job is to introduce my wife, Laura Bush. [Laughter] Before I do so, though, I want to say something about your moms and dads. I thank you very much for supporting your mom and dad as they're on a very important mission for our country. I want you to know that they love you dearly, and the American people love and respect those who wear our uniform a lot.
I know it's tough to have your mom or dad overseas, and we wish you all the best. But it's really important work. And so we wanted to welcome you here to the White House to, first of all, thank you for your strength, and so that you would do me a favor and e-mail your mom or dad who is overseas how much the Commander in Chief respects them, admires them, and supports them.
So welcome to the White House. We're glad you're here. And now I'm going to introduce my wife, Laura Bush.
