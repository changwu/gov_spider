    I appreciate Judge Johnson's willingness to accept this important position. He brings a reputation as a tough, fair-minded protector of justice and the law. My admiration for him is shared by those who have disagreed as well as agreed with his many difficult decisions from the bench. He will be a credit to the FBI, this administration, and the country.
I also commend the work of the selection commission and appreciate the large number of outstanding Americans who were willing to be considered for this position. My selection of Judge Johnson should in no way be considered a reflection on the commission's work.
