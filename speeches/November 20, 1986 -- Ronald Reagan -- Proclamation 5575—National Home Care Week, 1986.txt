A Proclamation
Home health care is an American tradition. When illness strikes our loved ones, we wish to care for them at home unless hospital or other care is clearly needed. This care is supplemented by the many members of our system of home health care providers who give special assistance to families and can make the difference in preventing, postponing, or limiting institutional care.
Our home health care system includes untold numbers of churches, volunteer groups, private agencies, and families, as well as government programs. All Americans can be proud of this effort for those in need, and of this national commitment to our American values of strong family life and neighbor helping neighbor.
Let us continue to emphasize the benefits of home health care. Let us also give much-deserved thanks and recognition to the dedicated men and women of our home health care system who help us care for our loved ones, preserve their independence, and keep our families intact.
The Congress, by Public Law 99-535, has designated the week of November 30 through December 6, 1986, as "National Home Care Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of November 30 through December 6, 1986, as National Home Care Week, and I call upon the appropriate government officials, interested organizations and associations, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
