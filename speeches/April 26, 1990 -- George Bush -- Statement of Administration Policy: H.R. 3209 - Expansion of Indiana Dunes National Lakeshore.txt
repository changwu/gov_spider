    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Visclosky (D) Indiana and 3 others)
The National Park Service (NPS) is currently preparing a Development Concept Plan (DCP) that will consider appropriate boundary revisions for Lakeshore's West Unit. The Administration believes that proposals to modify the Lakeshore's boundaries should be delayed until the West Unit's DCP has been completed. The Administration opposes H.R. 3209 because it would add prematurely 2,000 acres of private land to the Lakeshore.
