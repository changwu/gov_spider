Dana Perino: Do you think you made a difference yesterday in trying to broaden the audience to get people to understand that you are Tim Scott, you are an individual, you happen to be conservative, you happen to be Black, but that is not what defines you?
Tim Scott: One of the things that we as conservatives have to do is we have to go where we're not invited. We have to spend time selling our message of conservatism to people who may be naturally inclined to say yes to our message, but they've never had a messenger show up. 
Dana Perino: So where might you go aside from "The View?"
Tim Scott: I did a town hall this past Sunday in an African American church to have a conversation about why it is that we can believe in the future of this country – working together. I'm going to do an event in a Brazilian church coming up in the next few months. My goal is to go throughout the country. If you wanna be a different kind of president, you should be a different kind of candidate.
