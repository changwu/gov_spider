    This afternoon, President Biden hosted Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to talk about their shared agenda of tackling inflation and lowering prices and transitioning from a historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth. Thanks to their shared leadership, we've seen unprecedented job and small business creation. They discussed their plans for fighting the global problem of inflation that is affecting every major economy, such as bringing down prescription drug and energy costs, and adding to the historic deficit reduction we have accomplished.
