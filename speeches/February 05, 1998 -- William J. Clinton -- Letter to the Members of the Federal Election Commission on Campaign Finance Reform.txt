    To the Members of the Federal Election Commission:
I strongly support action to end the soft money raised by both political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority. I am very pleased that your General Counsel has proposed a new rule prohibiting national parties from raising soft money. Banning soft money fundraising by national party committees will enable our election laws to catch up with the reality of the way elections are financed today, and along with new campaign finance reform legislation, will take significant strides toward restoring public confidence in the campaign finance process.
Now I ask you to step up to your responsibility and act, within your legal authority, to end the soft money system. The American people deserve nothing less.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
