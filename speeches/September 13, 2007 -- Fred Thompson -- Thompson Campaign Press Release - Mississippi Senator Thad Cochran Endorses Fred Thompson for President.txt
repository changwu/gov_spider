Senator Thad Cochran stated: "I am pleased to announce my support for Fred Thompson for President of the United States. Senator Thompson is the candidate best able to win the general election in 2008 and carry our conservative values all the way to the White House. I worked closely with him in the United States Senate and know he has the conservative values, integrity, experience, and judgment to unite our country, lead our nation, fight the Global War on Terrorism, and keep us safe."
