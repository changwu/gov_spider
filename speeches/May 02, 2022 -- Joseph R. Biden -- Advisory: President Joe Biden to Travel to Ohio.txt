    On Friday, May 6, the President will travel to Cincinnati, Ohio to meet with manufacturing leaders, see new additive manufacturing technologies at work, and discuss his plan to make more in America by building on the 473,000 manufacturing jobs created since he took officeâ€”more jobs on average per month than under any other President in the last 50 years. The President will call on Congress to build on that success and pass legislation like the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will create good-paying jobs, boost domestic manufacturing, and lower prices for working families. This trip will be pooled press. Additional details to follow.
