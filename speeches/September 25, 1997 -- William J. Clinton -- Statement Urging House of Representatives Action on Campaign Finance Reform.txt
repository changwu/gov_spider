    I am greatly encouraged by the statements calling for House action on campaign finance reform legislation made earlier today by Democratic Leader Gephardt, and yesterday by House Majority Leader Armey. I applaud these two House leaders for their commitment to scheduling a House floor debate on this critical issue before Congress adjourns for the year.
This bipartisan call for action is a promising sign that we are moving forward in our response to America's demand for reform. I urge the Members of the House to take the next step and give their full support for the meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform offered by Representatives Shays and Meehan. This measure is both balanced and effective, and it addresses many of the most pressing needs for reform.
Congress faces the best opportunity in a generation to enact campaign finance reform. Let us work together in a bipartisan spirit to enact the Shays-Meehan legislation and answer the public's call for reform.
