    I am shocked and saddened by the death today of U.S. District Judge John II. Wood, Jr., in San Antonio, Tex. The killing of a Federal judgeâ€”or any judge-is an assault on our very system of justice. All Americans join me in condemning this heinous crime.
Judge Wood had a 30-year career in the private bar, followed by 8 years on the bench, where he served with distinction. A jurist who was courageous, hard-working, tough-minded, and fair, Judge Wood was admired by prosecutors and defense lawyers alike.
I have been assured by Attorney General Griffin Bell that Director William Webster and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have given top priority to bringing those responsible for Judge Wood's murder to justice. Deputy Assistant Director James Ingram of the FBI has been dispatched from FBI headquarters in Washington to take charge of the Federal investigation. Fifty special agents and two FBI specialists have been assigned to the investigation in Texas.
I know I speak on behalf of the American people in expressing outrage at the senseless death of Judge Wood. Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
