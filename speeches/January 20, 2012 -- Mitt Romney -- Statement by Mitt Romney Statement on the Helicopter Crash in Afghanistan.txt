    Mitt Romney made the following statement regarding news of the death of six Marines in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan:
"News that six Marines have died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan fills me with anguish. Let us never forget that the freedom and comfort we enjoy here at home come at a high price. As with the members of the Greatest Generation who fought to preserve our freedom years ago, the young men and women who risk their lives today must be counted as the greatest of their generation."
