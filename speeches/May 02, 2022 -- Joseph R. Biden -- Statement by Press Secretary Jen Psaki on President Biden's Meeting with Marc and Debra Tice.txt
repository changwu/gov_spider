    President Biden met today with Marc and Debra Tice, the parents of Austin Tice, who has spent almost a decade in captivity in Syria. During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work through all available avenues to secure Austin's long overdue return to his family. The President further emphasized that his Administration will work relentlessly until Austin and other Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained worldwide are safely at home with their loved ones.
Today's meeting built on multiple meetings and conversations between the Tice family and the President's national security team, which will remain in regular contact with the Tices and other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. We appreciate the bravery and candor of families enduring these harrowing experiences, and we remain committed to supporting them and, most importantly, reuniting them with their loved ones.
