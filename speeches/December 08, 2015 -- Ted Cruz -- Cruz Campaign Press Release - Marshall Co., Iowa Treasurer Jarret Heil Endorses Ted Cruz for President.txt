    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today Presidential candidate Ted Cruz welcomed the endorsement of Marshall County Treasurer Jarret Heil. First elected in 2010, Heil also serves as the President of the Iowa State County Treasurers Association and as the Chair of the Iowa Republican County Officials Association.
"I'm a strong supporter of Ted Cruz and am honored to be a member of his Iowa Leadership team," said Heil. "Americans are thirsting for leadership to strip power from the political ruling class in Washington, and bring the government back to we the people. Cruz fits that mold and is that leader. In the U.S. Senate, he has taken that fight to the reckless policies of the current administration and has challenged his own party leadership when necessary. As a true conservative, Cruz's vision for America is rooted in his deep constitutional understanding and values founded on his faith. I am excited to join this vast grassroots team that will help make Ted Cruz our next President of the United States."
Highlighting the strength and diversity of his Iowa Leadership Team, Cruz said "Jarret is a great example of the dynamic young leaders who are rising up all over this country. Men and women who are not satisfied to take a seat among their elders and sustain the status quo. I'm thrilled to have his support. He is a great addition to our Iowa Leadership Team."
Heil has been married to his wife Dawna for eight years and they have four children together. They are also members of St. Henry's Catholic Church in Marshalltown, Iowa.
