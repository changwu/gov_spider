    "The sharp increase in the number of people in the U.S. with HIV is extremely alarming and further demonstrates that much work needs to be done to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in this country."
"Throughout my time in the Senate, I have fought for increased funding for prevention, treatment, supportive services and research, but we need a leader in the White House who will take this issue head on and develop the solutions we need."
"As President, I will implement an aggressive national strategy. We need to ensure that we are doing everything possible to prevent new infections. I will put an end to the Bush administration's abstinence-only prevention policy, and instead, fund evidence-based HIV/AIDS prevention programs including, but not limited to, abstinence education as part of a comprehensive prevention message. I have also proposed a doubling in the HIV/AIDS research budget within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to $5.2 billion annually, and my American Health Choices Plan will ensure that all Americans living with HIV/AIDS have access to care."
"I believe with leadership and smart investments we can significantly reduce the number of new infections and develop treatments that turn HIV/AIDS into a chronic but manageable condition."
