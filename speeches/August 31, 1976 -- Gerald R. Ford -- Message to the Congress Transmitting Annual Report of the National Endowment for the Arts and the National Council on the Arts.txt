    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit to the Congress the Annual Report of the National Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts for Fiscal Year 1975.
Our Bicentennial year marks the beginning of a second decade for the Arts Endowment which, under the guidance of the National Council, has made a substantial contribution to enriching the quality of life in America. This is a time for us to reflect upon our history and to reassess our goals for the future. The arts have always been an expression of the diversity of America's richly varied cultural experience. We are beginning to appreciate how important the arts are as resources--to improve our cities--to bring creativity into our schools-to bring greater perception to all, young and old.
This Annual Report reflects the Federal government's continuing support for the arts and its concern that public funds be instrumental in generating private dollars. The efforts of the Arts Endowment in that regard are very gratifying and I hope that each member of Congress will share my enthusiasm for this agency's achievements.
