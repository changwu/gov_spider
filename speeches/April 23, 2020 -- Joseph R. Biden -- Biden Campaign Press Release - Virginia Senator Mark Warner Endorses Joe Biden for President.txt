    Virginia Senator Mark Warner released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President:
"For decades, Vice President Biden has been on the frontlines of the fight for working people in Virginia and across the country. He's always stood up for those who aren't getting a fair shot. He's worked tirelessly to ensure that our small businesses can succeed and compete on a level playing field. And he's never forgotten his middle class background, bringing that lived experience first to the Senate and then to the White House alongside President Obama.
"As President, Joe Biden is going to be someone who can rally us around our shared American values and our common goals: goals like ensuring access to quality health care for all Americans, tackling the threat of climate change, and giving our kids a quality education no matter their zip code.
"Joe Biden is the best person to unite our country and I will be on his team, fighting right alongside him as he does."
Senator Warner joins a broad and diverse list of more than 80 Virginian leaders who've announced their support for Joe Biden, including former Governor Terry McAuliffe; Senator Tim Kaine; Congresspersons Don Beyer, Gerry Connolly, Elaine Luria, Donald McEachin, Bobby Scott, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton; and other state and local leaders.
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
