    All across America, local news outlets are reporting on the outpouring of gratitude and relief that student loan borrowers are expressing about President Biden's "life-changing" announcement laying out his Administration's plan to provide up to $20,000 in debt cancellation to Pell Grant recipients and up to $10,000 in debt cancellation to non-Pell Grant recipients. These actions will help borrowers who need it most and hit hardest by the pandemic – with nearly 90% of relief dollars going to borrowers earning under $75,000 per year. And, these actions will make a real difference for current and future students.
In their own words:
"It's literally life-changing."
"I'm floored. I'm excited. I'm grateful. I believe it gives me the opportunity, and other people like me, an opportunity to really harness our lives." 
"I just think about how long it would take to save that amount… "I'm just so happy to hear that it's happening — $10,000 is a big deal." 
"People like me that didn't get a lot of scholarships to go to the colleges, we had to take out those loans. But, having something like this definitely helps for our future for sure.""I have student loans that will outlive me (I'm 63 now)… It will be such a relief to get out from under this never-ending burden!"
