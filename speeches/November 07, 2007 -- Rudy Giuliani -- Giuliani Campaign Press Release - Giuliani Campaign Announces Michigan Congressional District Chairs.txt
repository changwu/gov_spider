    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced its leadership in four Michigan Congressional Districts.
The campaign has named Chairs for the 10th, 12th, 13th, and 15th Congressional Districts, which include the Detroit area and surrounding counties.
"We are excited to join together in support of Mayor Giuliani, who has the most public executive leadership experience of anyone running and has displayed the kind of strong leadership our country needs," said Kim Porter-Hoppe, who will serve as Chair of the campaign's efforts in the 15th Congressional District.
Additionally, the campaign named Chairs for several counties within those four districts, including Huron, Lapeer, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Sanilac and St. Clair Shores counties.
"We're excited that Mayor Giuliani's campaign in Michigan continues to grow," said Rep. Candice Miller, Giuliani's Michigan State Chair. "These leaders in their respective communities will help communicate Mayor Giuliani's message to Michigan voters â€“ and we're confident that voters will see Rudy is the right man to be our nominee and our next President."
