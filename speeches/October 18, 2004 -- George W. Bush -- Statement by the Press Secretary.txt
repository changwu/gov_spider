    On behalf of the American people, President Bush warmly congratulates King Norodom Sihamoni on his assuming Cambodia's throne. The United States looks forward to supporting King Sihamoni as he carries out his important work on behalf of the Cambodian people. We also wish to salute former King Norodom Sihanouk for his tireless service to and sacrifices for his country over the past half century. Cambodia is an important friend of the United States. We wish the members of the royal family and all Cambodians health and happiness on this historic occasion.
