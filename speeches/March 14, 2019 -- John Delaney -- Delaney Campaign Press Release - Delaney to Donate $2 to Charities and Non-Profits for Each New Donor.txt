    Delaney Debate Challenge Launched Thursday
FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD â€“ John Delaney will personally donate $2 dollars to non-profits and charities for each new donor that contributes to his campaign as part of the Delaney Debate Challenge, a new online program launched today. Through pages linked on Delaney's website and social media channels, new donors will be able to select one of eleven charities that John will donate to in the person's name.
This initiative is in response to the DNC's requirement that candidates have at least 65,000 donors. The Delaney Debate Challenge will apply to the next 100,000 new donors.
"This campaign isn't about me, it's about bringing people together and serving the common good. The Delaney Debate Challenge is a way for us to highlight the incredible work done by charities and non-profits around the country as part of our larger effort to reach the 65,000 donor threshold being used for the debates," said Delaney.
Here's how it works:
Example 1: Susan in Montana is a new Delaney donor. She donates $1 to Delaney and decides to have her donation paired with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). She donates $1 to help John get on the debate stage, Delaney donates $2 to the EDF.
Example 2: Eric in Delaware is a new Delaney donor. He donates $5 to Delaney and decides to have his donation paired with Human Rights Campaign. He donates $5 to help John get on the debate stage, Delaney donates $2 to Human Rights Campaign.

American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
CARA/Dilley Pro Bono Project
