    More than 100 Business and Community Leaders to Advise Campaign, Mobilize Women for Nevada Caucus
Hillary Clinton's Nevada campaign today announced the formation of the Nevada Women's Leadership Council, a group of prominent civic, business and community leaders endorsing Clinton's bid for the presidency. The council will advise the campaign, lead efforts to organize "Women for Hillary" in Nevada and play a key role in mobilizing women for the January 19 caucus.
"I am supporting Senator Clinton because she has the strength, compassion, wisdom and gravitas it will take to lead our nation through these challenging times to a new place of opportunity, prosperity and peace," said council member Pam Egan. "Senator Clinton has the skills to win and the experience to lead. It's her time."
Council member Sandra Mack added, "Throughout her career in public service, Hillary has been a champion for issues important to women and families at home and around the world – including economic equality, education and equal, human rights for all. I'm delighted to play a strategic role in Nevada to make history, by electing Hillary Clinton our next president."
"This council brings together an amazing group of diverse women leaders – from a wide variety of backgrounds, professions and regions throughout the state," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. Their endorsement is indicative of the widespread support Hillary Clinton is inspiring among women around the country. It's exciting and humbling to have such a powerful group working on behalf of Senator Clinton in Nevada."
