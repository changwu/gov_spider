    Dear Mr. Speaker:
On April 15, the United States and more than one hundred other nations signed the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh, Morocco. It is the broadest, most comprehensive trade agreement in history.
For half a century, the United States has led the global effort to reduce trade barriers and expand trade. The Uruguay Round, which is scheduled to enter into force on January 1, 1995, represents the most important step in that effort.
This agreement will create hundreds of thousands of American jobs and new economic opportunities at home. Moreover, it will allow American workers and businesses to compete in a freer, fairer, and more effective global trading system that lays the foundation for prosperity into the next century.
I intend to transmit legislation to implement the Uruguay Round and am committed to seeking bipartisan support for its passage this year.
The attached booklet describes the Uruguay Round's benefit to American workers and firms. I look forward to working with you in the months ahead to implement this important agreement.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
