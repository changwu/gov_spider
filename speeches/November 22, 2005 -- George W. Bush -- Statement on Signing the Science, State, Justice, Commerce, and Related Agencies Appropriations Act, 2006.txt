    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2862, the "Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006." The Act funds the Departments of Justice, Commerce, and State, and several independent agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The executive branch shall construe as advisory the provisions of the Act that purport to direct or burden the Executive's conduct of foreign relations, including the authority to recognize foreign states and negotiate international agreements on behalf of the United States, or limit the President's authority as Commander in Chief. These provisions include sections 405, 413, 414, 631, 637, and language under the headings "International Trade Administration, Operations and Administration" and "Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities."
