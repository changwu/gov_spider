Denmark is a very special country with incredible people but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time....Retweets: 22931Favorites: 116295

....The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!Retweets: 15992Favorites: 95112

....like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God...But American Jews don't know him or like him. They don't even know what they're doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that's OK if he keeps doing what he's doing he's good for.....Retweets: 13288Favorites: 63104

The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the 'create' a U.S. recession even though the numbers & facts are working totally in the opposite direction.

Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. He's like a golfer who can't putt has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing BIG CUT - but don't count on him! So far he has called it wrong and only let us down....Retweets: 14969Favorites: 66563

.....We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them. Yesterday 'highest Dollar in U.S.History.' No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential almost like never before!Retweets: 12888Favorites: 55679

My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!Retweets: 16735Favorites: 68105

So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the U.S. a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....Retweets: 21513Favorites: 96989

For the record Denmark is only at 1.35% of GDP for NATO spending. They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. We protect Europe and yet only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark. The United States is at a much much higher level than that....Retweets: 20157Favorites: 93727

The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors are 'rolling over' at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost $3000 more to consumers.

Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn't work as well because execs don't want to fight California regulators. Car companies should know....Retweets: 16993Favorites: 86150

....that when this Administration's alternative is no longer available California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers!Retweets: 13431Favorites: 71501
