"Always" (30 seconds)
Friends, we're in a fight for our conservative values.
I'm a conservative. Always have been. Always will be.
I'll fight against amnesty and benefits for illegals.
I'll work to keep your taxes low and keep a prosperous economy.
I'm 100% pro-life, that's why South Carolina Citizens for Life endorsed me.
And you can trust me to protect our security against Islamic radicals.
I'm Fred Thompson and I approved this message because with your help, we can win this fight.
I'd appreciate your vote Saturday.
