    To the Senate of the United States.
In compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant, I transmit a report * from the Secretary of State, with the papers therewith presented. Not having accurate and detailed information of the civil, military, and political condition of Texas, I have deemed it expedient to take the necessary measures, now in progress, to procure it before deciding upon the course to be pursued in relation to the newly declared government.
* Relating to the political condition of Texas, the organization of its Government, and its capacity to maintain its independence, etc,
ANDREW JACKSON
