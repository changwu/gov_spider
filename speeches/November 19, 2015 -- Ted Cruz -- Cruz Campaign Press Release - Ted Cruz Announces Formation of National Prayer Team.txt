HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the formation of a national prayer team, "A Time for Prayer," scheduled to launch on December 1.
"Heidi and I are grateful for the prayers of people all over this nation," Cruz said. "We experience the power of prayer every day. We're organizing 'A Time for Prayer' to establish a direct line of communication between our campaign and the thousands of Americans who are lifting us up before the Lord. Our nation is in desperate need of God's favor — these are dangerous days for America, but these are also days of great hope. United in prayer and in purpose, we are committed to reignite the promise of our nation."
U.S. Presidents have long requested and relied on prayer. The Continental Congress called the colonies to prayer as they prepared to form the nation. In his Inaugural address on March 4, 1857, President James Buchanan alluded to the importance of prayer, "In entering upon this great office I must humbly invoke the God of our fathers for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible duties." Lincoln called for a day of fasting and prayer in 1863. And in 1952, Congress passed a resolution signed by President Truman declaring an annual day of national prayer.
"A Time for Prayer", led by Cruz Crew volunteers, is dedicated to a focused season of prayer on behalf of the nation, presidential candidate Ted Cruz, his family and staff, and the campaign.
Those interested in joining the National Prayer Team can visit www.tedcruz.org/pray to sign up. Members will receive weekly emails containing prayer requests and a short devotional. Each Tuesday, members will be invited to a 20-minute prayer conference call. The program launches on December 1.
