    The President. Well, I just want to thank everybody. The receptivity that we've had and the United States has had being here has been incredible. Sitting around this table are some of the greatest business leaders in the world, some of the greatest companies in the world. Probably, I can think of no other place or time where you'll have executives of this stature.
And I thought what I'd do is, first of all, I want to thank the professor for having done a fantastic job. Klaus, thank you very much. You have really done outstandingly. And putting this together at this level over many years has been a great tribute to you and your entire group and your entire family. So thank you very much. It's an honor to be here representing the United States.
World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus M. Schwab. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. I just want to say that there's been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country. And a lot of money—billions and billions of dollars—is coming into the U.S. And people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but also cutting of regulations, and I think also being a cheerleader for our country. You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for your country—[laughter]—no matter what happens, it's not going to work. And that's what I've been, and that's what my whole group has been.
So perhaps I'll start on my left, and you can go around. And here's one of the very big, powerful businesspeople of the world. And just say a few words about your company and whatever you'd like to do. Go ahead.
Siemens AG President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser. Yes, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for inviting me today.
The President. Thank you.
Mr. Kaeser. Obviously, I work for Siemens. We've got 56,000 people working in the United States, $34 billion in revenues. And obviously, a net exporter. So congratulations on your tax reform. I mean, you said this is what you're going to do. So you build it, and we'll come.
The President. We said it, right? We said it.
Mr. Kaeser. Yes.
The President. And by the way, when he says he works for Siemens, he's the president of Siemens, but that's okay. [Laughter] It's a good way of saying it. But go ahead.
Mr. Kaeser. Don't you work for your country?
The President. Yes, we work for our country. That's right. [Laughter] I agree, same thing. And Siemens is doing good?
Mr. Kaeser. We're doing really well, actually. A matter of fact, we've been investing quite a lot into the country. And since you have been successful with tax reform, we decided to develop the next-generation gas turbines in the United States.
The President. Oh, that's a big thing. That's very big. That's fantastic.
Mr. Kaeser. It is.
The President. Where will that be developed?
Mr. Kaeser. Charlotte.
The President. Oh, in Charlotte, great. That's fantastic. Well, thank you. On behalf of Charlotte, thank you very much—and our country.
Mr. Kaeser. Our pleasure. Thank you.

We operate 77 plants. Almost everything we sell is locally made. We operate 10 R&D centers, and we're excited about what's going on in the U.S. market.

Mr. Schneider. Coffee, infant nutrition, water, pet food. Those are the—[inaudible].
The President. Yes. Fantastic job you've done. Thank you very much.
Mr. Schneider. Thank you.
The President. Professor.
Mr. Schwab. Yes. World Economic Forum engaged also in the United States. But you probably do not know one-third of our staff is working in—we have only 800 people. [Laughter] But tiny compared to you. But one-third of the staff is working in New York and in our Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco.
The President. That's very good. Has this been a very successful one, right here, now?
Mr. Schwab. Yes.
The President. Has it all gone very well? Because it seems to really be going smoothly. A lot of really good relationships.
Mr. Schwab. Yes. And even more what I mentioned before, Mr. President, the World Economic Forum is a very business-driven approach to global cooperation.
The President. Right.
Mr. Schwab. I think many of the issues can be much faster and much more efficient to resolve if business is involved. And so that's what we are doing: creating coalitions between governments, business, and, to a certain extent, also the young generations.
The President. Right.
Mr. Schwab. To make sure that we really have a pragmatic approach in global governance.
The President. That's good. Well, we're honored to be here and be with you. Thank you, Professor.
Mr. Schwab. Thank you.
Nokia President and Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri. Good evening, Mr. President. I'm Rajeev Suri from Nokia. We're the leading networks—telecom networks company in the world, so number two. We have 15,000 people in the U.S., and it's one of our strongest R&D setups in the world. We're spread throughout the U.S. We have—after the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent.
The President. Right.
Mr. Suri. We own Nokia Bell Labs, which is in New Jersey. We do a lot of stuff in the West Coast, we're in Chicago, throughout the country, really. So about just under half of our people do research and development, and the rest are doing services and 4G networks and 5G networks.
The President. Right, yes. Great job.
Mr. Suri. So I'm very happy and pleased with your infrastructure focus and focus on 5G.

And Volvo Trucks also, for North America is 100 percent made in the United States as well, as well as our construction equipment in Pennsylvania; as a matter of fact, in Allentown and Shippensburg and in Middletown, in New River Valley in Virginia. So we are primarily focused on the East Coast. We are just now running the biggest investment program in our company's history, in the United States, for R&D.
The President. Great. How much with you will be investing?
Mr. Lundstedt. We'll be, for the time being, just north of 2 billion U.S. dollars into—on that specific program. But we have a big share of—[inaudible]—very, very good and talented engineers for the future technology as well, when it comes to infrastructure and transportation. Autonomous and—[inaudible].
The President. That's great. Absolutely. Well, we're going to be doing a lot of that. I asked the question before, when I heard Volvo, and I know they own Mack Truck—I said, what's the difference in price—[laughter]—between a Mack and a Volvo comparable truck? And you said——
Mr. Lundstedt. I said, I mean things are very strong, multiplication aside—[inaudible]. [Laughter] But it's nearly 15 percent.
The President. He said they're both great, but a Mack is about 15 percent more. [Laughter] That was very, very good. Thank you very much for that investment in the U.S. Two billion dollars is great. Thank you very much.
Adidas AG Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted. Mr. President, thank you for the invitation. I represent the adidas team.
The President. Adidas, good.

Bayer AG Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann. So, my name is Werner Baumann, I'm the CEO of Bayer. That's a company that, in the future, will be known as the company that was formerly the aspirin company.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Baumann. So we are working heavily on acquiring Monsanto, a national icon in the U.S., making good progress. And I hope to close this transaction early 2018, so it should be a minute.
The President. So what percentage of your company is the aspirin?
Mr. Baumann. Aspirin is a 1.1—just about 1.1 billion euro, so $1.4 billion.
The President. So that's a pretty small percentage.
Mr. Baumann. It's relatively small, but it's one of the few brands that has been growing for 120 years. It's very profitable. And I think you take it as well. [Laughter]
The President. I do. I take one a day. [Laughter] I generally—I should say, I only take Bayer. [Laughter] One aspirin a day. That's—so far, it's been working. But it's a great company. So are you going to be investing in the U.S.?
Mr. Baumann. Yes, we are. We will actually consolidate most of our activities also into the Monsanto headquarters—the former Monsanto headquarters in St. Louis. We're going to invest about $16 billion, if you look at our R&D bill——
The President. Sixteen billion, wow.
Mr. Baumann. ——our R&D investment in crop alone. And 60 percent out of that is going to be in the U.S. over the next 6 years.
The President. That's fantastic. Thank you very much. That's really great. Thank you.

Mr. Pouyanné. Yes, we are fourth largest in the world, and third by reserves—more than 10 billion barrel reserves. But yes, despite the oil price, we invest around $15 billion each year and one—at least $1 billion as an average in the U.S. And you, of course, for us—the U.S.—[inaudible]—gas revolution, shale revolution—is the land, it's a nebulous business case, because low-cost energy, low feedstock—low-cost feedstock. So we come, and even we will do more with your tax reform, no?
The President. It's a great company.
Mr. Pouyanné. And we are also invested in renewables.
The President. Right.
Mr. Pouyanné. I know, maybe you disagree—[laughter]—but in solar business, in a U.S. company.
The President. Good.
Mr. Pouyanné. We are the majority shareholder of SunPower, California company, high-tech company. And so we are heavily invested in—we have invested more than $2 billion in that company to develop solar in the U.S.

So I would like to congratulate you——
The President. Okay.
Mr. Saetre. ——like many of us here, on the tax reform. I think that is really good news, I guess, for all of us here, but also for the oil and gas and our industry.
The President. Good news for a lot of people.
Mr. Saetre. Going to serve us well. I'd just mention, oil and gas is also a heavily regulated business.
The President. Right.
Mr. Saetre. So your thinking and your reflections on what you're doing on regulations is good news.
The President. We're opening it up, and we're becoming energy self-sufficient very rapidly. We really, just about, are hitting that mark. And as you know, we're opening up a lot of different places in the U.S., including the plants that you're building.

The President. One year writeoff.
Mr. Spiesshofer. Yes.
The President. Big difference, right? [Laughter]
