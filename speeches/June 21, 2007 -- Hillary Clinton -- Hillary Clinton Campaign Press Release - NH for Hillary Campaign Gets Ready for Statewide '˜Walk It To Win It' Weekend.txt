    Campaign volunteers will participate in canvasses and phonebanks throughout the state
MANCHESTER â€“ As the first official weekend of summer approaches, the New Hampshire for Hillary Campaign is preparing for its statewide "Walk It to Win It" weekend. Hundreds of volunteers will contact thousands of voters through phone banking, canvassing and other activities planned throughout the state.
"In New Hampshire our volunteers are the campaign," said Nick Clemons, Hillary for President State Director. "Whether they are knocking on doors, calling neighbors on the phone, or writing postcards to voters it is their efforts that will make the difference for Hillary Clinton in the Granite State."
Last month, the NH for Hillary Campaign became the first of the presidential campaigns to hold a statewide grassroots effort. For the May 12th "Day of Action," volunteers took advantage of a variety of new and traditional grassroots opportunities. "Walk It to Win It" activities are taking place in Manchester, Concord, Keene, Nashua, Laconia, Hanover, Rochester, Plymouth, Derry, Dover and Portsmouth.
On Friday, June 15th Senator Clinton joined New Hampshire families at Dartmouth College in Hanover for her ninth trip to the state. She will be returning on July 13th with former President Bill Clinton for their first joint campaign event in New Hampshire to help kick off the summer.
Additional information about the "Walk It to Win It" weekend can be found on the New Hampshire for Hillary webpage, www.hillaryclinton.com/nh or by calling (603) 634-4455.
