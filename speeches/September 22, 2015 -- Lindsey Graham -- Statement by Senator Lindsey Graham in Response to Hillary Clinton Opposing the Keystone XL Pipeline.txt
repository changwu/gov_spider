    Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Senator Lindsey Graham released the following statement in response to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline:
"In opposing the Keystone oil pipeline, Hillary Clinton once again shows that she intends to continue the failed policies and poor decisions of the Obama Administration.
"Building this pipeline is essential to our national security by reducing our dependence on oil from countries that hate us. Keystone represents sound environmental policy that will move the American economy in the right direction and strengthen our national security.
"As president, I would immediately approve Keystone XL."
