    A new analysis by the independent Center on Budget and Policy Priories estimates that the Build Back Better will reduce deficits by $2 trillion in the second decade. This is the first comprehensive analysis to consider the long-run fiscal impact of the bill. Already, analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, Joint Committee on Taxation, and U.S. Department of the Treasury together confirm that the bill is fully paid for in the first decade. As Secretary Yellen wrote in a letter to all members of Congress yesterday that included the Center's analysis, "these points confirm that the Build Back Better Act represents fiscally responsible legislation that will leave our nation's budget in an improved position."
