    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Washington State Senator Dino Rossi.
"Dino Rossi has been a champion in the state of Washington for the issues I am fighting for in my campaign — it is an honor to have his support," said Mitt Romney. "Dino showed in the State Senate that it's possible to write a responsible bipartisan budget and hold government accountable — I hope to bring these same principles to Washington so that government can balance its budget."
"Mitt Romney's background and knowledge of the economy are unparalleled in this field," said Dino Rossi. "As a businessman, he knows you can't spend more than you take in and that federal regulations too often get in the way of our ability to create jobs and prosperity. I urge my fellow Washingtonians to support Mitt Romney because our economy can't afford four more years of failure from the White House. The most important issue facing the federal government is to create a sustainable budget that doesn't continue to drain resources away from private employers and innovative entrepreneurs. Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to lead this effort."
Background on Dino Rossi:
Dino Rossi served in the Washington State Senate from 1997 to 2003. Rossi served on the Ways and Means Committee and helped the state close a budget gap without raising taxes. Rossi is a two-time Republican gubernatorial and Senate candidate.
