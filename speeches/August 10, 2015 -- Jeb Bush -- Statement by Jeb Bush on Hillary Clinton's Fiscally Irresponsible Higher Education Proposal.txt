    This irresponsible proposal would raise taxes, increase government debt, and double-down on the failed Obama economic policies that have led to a 'new normal' of sluggish economic growth, rising college costs spurred by Washington, and limited opportunities for all Americans â€“ including recent college graduates.
We don't need more top-down Washington solutions that will raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers. We need to change the incentives for colleges with fresh policies that result in more individualization and choices, drive down overall costs, and improve the value of a college degree, which will help lead to real, sustained four-percent economic growth.
We also need additional pro-growth economic policies that will give more college graduates the opportunity to achieve earned success rather than continuing down the path of declining workforce participation and access to jobs.
