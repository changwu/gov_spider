    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of former Florida Congressman Dante Fascell. Just last month, I had the privilege to award Congressman Fascell with the Medal of Freedom for his 38 years of dedicated public service in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Dante Fascell contributed immeasurably to America's national security, to our leadership in the global economy, and to our quality of life. He demonstrated an unwavering commitment to civil rights, environmental protection, and openness in Government. Dante served as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for 9 years, supporting emerging democracies, pressing for arms control, and promoting fair trade and dialog among nations. His achievements are a testament to his vision and leadership. We will miss this true hero, whose selfless conduct as a public servant set a shining example for all Americans. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Jeanne-Marie, his two children, and the entire Fascell family.
