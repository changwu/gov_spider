    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that New Hampshire State Representative David Hess is supporting Mayor Giuliani for President. The eight-term Hooksett Republican becomes the second member of the New Hampshire House GOP leadership to back the Mayor.
"Rudy found an ungovernable city when he became Mayor of New York and restored quality of life to its residents," said Hess, who once lived in the city. "There's no denying that if you can turn New York City around you can turn anything around. He is the candidate with the most public executive leadership in the race and is singularly prepared to lead our nation."
"Dave is well-known in New Hampshire as an outspoken fiscal conservative. His support for Rudy reflects the Mayor's strong credentials on cutting taxes and controlling spending," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman. "It is an honor to have the support of Representative Hess, someone who understands the importance of fiscal discipline in government."
Representative Hess joins House GOP Whip Stephen Stepanek in supporting the Mayor.
