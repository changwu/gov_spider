    Little Rock, AR -- Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement regarding the death of U.S. Congressman Henry Hyde (IL):
"With the passing of Congressman Henry Hyde, America lost a great defender of human life. At least one million Americans are with us today because he championed the Hyde Amendment, the most significant and longstanding government restriction on abortion funding ever initiated. Congressman Hyde was a man of deep faith and unshakable conviction and I am deeply grateful for his example and good works. My prayers and condolences go out to the Hyde family and to the all those who mourn the loss of this great man."
