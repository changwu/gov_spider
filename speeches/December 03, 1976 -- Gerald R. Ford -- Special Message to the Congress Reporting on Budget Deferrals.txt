    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report four new deferrals of funds totaling $3.7 billion. Funds deferred were appropriated for the Department of Labor, two International Security Assistance programs, and ACTION.
In addition, I am reporting revisions to two deferrals previously transmitted. The Department of Defense military construction deferral is increased by $259.4 million and a General Revenue Sharing deferral in the Department of the Treasury is increased by $11.1 million.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
