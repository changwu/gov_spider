Verona, PA - The people of Iowa spoke this past Saturday and Senator Rick Santorum's campaign shattered expectations with a strong showing at the Ames Straw Poll.
Senator Santorum took his message of proven conservative leadership directly to the people and it clearly resonated. Though outspent more than 10:1 by his competitors, Senator Santorum's message broke through and Iowa recognized that it is Senator Santorum who has the courage to fight for America.
The reviews are in and the media, from NBC News to ABC News and The Washington Post, can no longer ignore what the people of Iowa and South Carolina have been saying for months: Rick Santorum is the candidate who places leadership above showmanship, and has the courage to lead. Now, it's "game on."
