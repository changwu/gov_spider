Sen. McCain Says That Airing His Positions On Issues Is An Attack:
Sen. McCain Complains That A Simple Airing Of Policy Positions Is "Attacking." SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "If there's any doubt that we're doing well, it's when Mitt Romney starts attacking." (National Review Online, Posted 12/28/07)
But A Polite Contrast On Issues Is Hardly An Attack. "As so-called attack ads go, this seems rather mild. It focuses on McCain's record, doesn't call him names, and even offers that McCain is an 'honorable man.' There's nothing objectionable about it in that sense. Campaigns are all about making choices, as both men make clear." (Ed Morrissey, "A Tale Of Two Television Ads," Captain's Quarters Blog, Posted 12/28/07)
An Actual Attack Ad Would Compare Your Republican Opponent To Bill Clinton:
In 2000, Sen. McCain Ran An Attack Ad Comparing Then-Gov. Bush To Bill Clinton. SEN. MCCAIN: "I guess it was bound to happen. Governor Bush's campaign is getting desperate, with a negative ad about me. The fact is, I'll use the surplus money to fix Social Security, cut your taxes and pay down the debt. Governor Bush uses all of the surplus for tax cuts, with not one new penny for Social Security or the debt. His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty tired of that. As president, I'll be conservative and always tell you the truth. No matter what." (McCain 2000, Campaign Ad, 2/9/00; www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHoXkCprdL4)
