    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Ohio Senate President Tom Niehaus.
"I'm proud to have Tom's support," said Mitt Romney. "Tom shares my values of lowering taxes, cutting spending, and reducing the size of government. If we do these things, I believe we can empower Ohio's small businesses and rebuild the middle class. I look forward to Tom's help in spreading this message to Buckeye State voters."
"Ohioans are looking for a change in leadership," said Senate President Niehaus. "However, we cannot expect a creature of Washington to come in and change it. Mitt Romney is a conservative businessman who spent his life in the private sector. He owes nothing to special interests and his only 'team' is the American people. Ohio needs a bold leader who will restore our economy and bring jobs back to our state. Mitt Romney is that man and I am proud to support him. I urge my fellow conservatives who are looking for a fresh start with a true outsider to join me in standing with him."
