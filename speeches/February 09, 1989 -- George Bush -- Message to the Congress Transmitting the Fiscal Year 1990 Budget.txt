    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit a supplement to the Message I am delivering to the Joint Session of the Congress tonight. It is titled "Building a Better America," and it contains further description of the plans and proposals mentioned in the Message. I urge the Congress to give favorable consideration to these proposals and renew my invitation to the congressional leadership to work together to assure that America is united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound.
George Bush
