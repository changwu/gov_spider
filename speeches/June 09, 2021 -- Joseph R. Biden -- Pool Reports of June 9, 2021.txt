Pool Report No 5 
POTUS has finished shaking hands at 9:35 and we are rolling back down the tarmac to AF 1.
With apologies from your pooler, the gaggle came just as we were landing, and then we were motocading to the speech. I'm told many are still awaiting transcript. No major news, but for later in the summit note his language on vaccines -- he said WH will be speaking on it tomorrow, but the news has broken already -- the meaning of "strategic stability" at this first session with Putin and the challenges of getting to "longer and stronger."
Rolling on AF1 at 9:50.
