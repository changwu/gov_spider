    Long-time Clinton Advisor and Community Banker to Organize Broad-Based Support for Clinton Campaign
The Clinton Campaign announced today that Bob J. Nash, long-time Clinton advisor and community banker, will join Hillary's campaign as Deputy Campaign Manager.
"I am honored that Bob is joining my campaign," Clinton said. "Bob and I have worked together for 25 years, and he shares my vision for renewing America's promise."
Nash was President Clinton's White House Personnel Director from 1994-2001 and is currently Vice Chairman of ShoreBank Corporation in Chicago, the leading community development bank in the U.S.
As President Clinton's White House Personnel Director, Nash led the administration's efforts to hire a diverse workforce that represented all Americans.
"I have worked with Hillary Clinton for over 25 years. She is smart and has the biggest heart of anyone I know," Nash said. "She has what it takes to lead this country and represent all Americans, and I am excited to be a part of her team."
A native of Texarkana, Arkansas, Nash worked on Bill Clinton's gubernatorial and presidential campaigns and Hillary's Senate contests, focusing on reaching out to racial, ethnic and minority groups.
Then-Governor Clinton appointed Nash as President of the Arkansas State Development Finance Authority, where he managed a multi-billion dollar public sector finance institution to support Arkansas' housing, small business and public facilities.
Nash will resign his position at ShoreBank and move to Washington, DC, to join the Clinton campaign in April.
