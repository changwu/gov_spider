Very sad to see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists & looters, many of them having no idea what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage, both....Retweets: 30403Favorites: 135569

A @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies, with nobody defending. They talked about the "friendly" protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly), and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn't upside down. @edhenryRetweets: 29031Favorites: 113145
