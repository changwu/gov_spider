    HAMBURG, IA — Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, was on the ground in Pacific Junction and Hamburg, Iowa, to visit with and assist families whose homes and businesses were devastated by the recent flooding. She joined volunteers in helping to clean up a house that had been flooded to the ceiling, removing drywall, flooring, carpet and furniture. She thanked first responders, teachers, and community volunteers who have been offering relief, shelter, and supplies to those in need.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said heavy rain this spring will make conditions even worse in most states with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
"The grit and resilience in these communities, even in the wake of such great loss, is a symbol of the strength of the American spirit. We must do all we can to support those whose farms, businesses, and homes have been destroyed. There are hundreds of families who are still displaced and many who will not ever be able to return to their homes," said Tulsi Gabbard after witnessing historic flood damage in Southwest Iowa. "The contamination of wells and water continues to threaten their health and well-being, along with concerns about future flooding due to inadequate levees. Congress must act now to provide aid to these families and farms in need, and we must invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure."
