    There's more good news for our economy this morning and more indications that we are starting to see inflation moderate. Today's news—that prices paid by businesses moderated last month—comes a week after news that prices paid by consumers have also moderated. And today's report also showed that food inflation slowed, a welcome sign for family's grocery bills as we head into the holidays.
The bottom line is this: My economic plan is showing results, and we face global economic challenges from a position of strength. As I said last week, it will take time to get inflation back to normal levels—and we could see setbacks along the way—but we will keep at it. And I want to repeat that I will work with anyone—Democrats or Republicans—who have ideas on how we can provide more breathing room to middle class and working families.
