    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Hoekstra (R) MI)
The Administration appreciates the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's support of the work and efforts of the Intelligence Community (IC). The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee to address our concerns on H.R. 2475, which authorizes appropriations for Fiscal Year 2006 for the conduct of the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States Government. We share the Committee's goal of continuing our strong cooperation to ensure that the IC has the tools and resources it needs to enhance our national-security posture and win the Global War on Terror.
Because the Administration has not yet been provided a copy of the Classified Schedule of Authorizations to which section 102 of the bill refers, the Administration can only reiterate that authorization for funding at the level requested in the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2006 is essential to the effective conduct of U.S. intelligence activities. The Administration understands that the Classified Schedule contains certain program reductions from the request and would have serious concerns should that be the case. We would want to work with the Committee to address these concerns as the legislative process continues.
The Administration understands that sections 303, 305, and 401 are not expected to be included in the House-passed version of the bill. These provisions would unnecessarily alter the recently enacted authorities of the Director of National Intelligence as contained in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. We appreciate House action to remove them from the bill.
The Administration opposes section 307, which relates to an intelligence special access program inventory. Existing law and understandings provide the proper arrangements for ensuring that appropriate congressional committees are informed of intelligence and intelligence-related activities.
