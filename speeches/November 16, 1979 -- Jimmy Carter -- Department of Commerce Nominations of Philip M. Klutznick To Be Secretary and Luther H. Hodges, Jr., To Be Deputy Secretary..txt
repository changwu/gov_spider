    I have two announcements.
First of all, as I suspect you already know, the President will nominate Philip M. Klutznick, a Chicago attorney and businessman, former U.S. Representative, with the rank of Ambassador, to the U.N. Economic and Social Council, as Secretary of Commerce. Mr. Klutznick has had a great deal of experience in the two most important areas of concern to the Commerce Departmentâ€”trade, particularly in its international aspects, and economic development. If you don't already have his biography, you will by the time this briefing is over. And I think it outlines very clearly his long-term and broad experience in both of those areas.
In addition, the President will nominate Luther Hodges, Jr., to serve in the new position of Deputy Secretary in the Department of Commerce. That position will be created when, as we expect shortly, the reorganization bill goes into effect, creating a new Department of Commerce and Trade.
