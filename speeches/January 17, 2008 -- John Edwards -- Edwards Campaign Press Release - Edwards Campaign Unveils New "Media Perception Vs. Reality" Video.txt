    New video and web feature highlight the difference between the media's portrayal of the Democratic presidential campaign and the reality that there are still three strong contenders in the race
Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today the John Edwards for President campaign unveiled a new web feature and video focusing on the media's slanted coverage of the presidential race. The new "Media Perception vs. Reality" webpage features a new video of news clips that focus exclusively on Senators Obama and Clinton contrasted with Fox News' focus group that overwhelmingly concluded that Edwards was the winner of the recent Nevada debate.
The new web feature also includes a graph comparing news coverage of Obama, Clinton and Edwards from January 6th through 11th based on data from the Project for Excellence in Journalism. The graph shows that while 25 percent of campaign news stories by major outlets mentioned Clinton and more than 15 percent mentioned Obama, Edwards was mentioned less than three percent of the time.
"For the better part of a year the media has focused on two celebrity candidates," John Edwards for President communications director Chris Kofinis said. "And they continue to act as if there were only two candidates in the race, even after John Edwards beat Senator Clinton in Iowa and poll after poll show competitive races in Nevada, South Carolina and other key states.
"John Edwards has led the field with the boldest agenda for change and he's the only candidate who has the strength and courage to stand up to the powerful entrenched interests and fight for the middle class families," Kofinis continued. "Perceptions aside, the race for the Democratic nomination is a three person race, and John Edwards will fight for every vote and every delegate all the way to the convention."
