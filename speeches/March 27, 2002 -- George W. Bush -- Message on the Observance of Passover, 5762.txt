    I send greetings to all Americans and to all people around the world who are observing Passover this week, which begins at sundown on March 27.
Passover marks a uniquely special time in the Jewish calendar, commemorating Judaism's foremost traditions of freedom, faith, and family. In celebrating the Israelites' liberation from enslavement and their exodus from Egypt, Passover reminds Jews of their sacred tradition. It is a time for Jewish families to share together in long-established rituals and to offer prayers that celebrate the renewal of hope in the blessings of freedom.
The story of the Exodus speaks across the millennia. By God's power and blessing, the children of Abraham overcame Pharaoh's tyranny forty centuries ago and found freedom in the promised land. Every year at Passover, Jews relive the experience of the Exodus and remember the miracles that provided them their path to freedom.
As we seek peace throughout the world, we are reminded that freedom is a precious gift. At this Passover, I hope that people of every faith will affirm that freedom is the right of all people. And as Jews observe this sacred time, I hope that your faith will be strengthened in the remembrance of your miraculous and living heritage.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed Passover.
