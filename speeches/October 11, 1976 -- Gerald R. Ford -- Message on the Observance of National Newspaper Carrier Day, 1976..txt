    THE FINE young people who deliver our nation's newspapers to millions of readers are most deserving of a special day of tribute to their hard work, diligence and enterprise.
They represent the finest spirit of a society that was built on and rewards individual initiative, and that has flourished because of the ability of its citizens to assume responsibility in community life.
National Newspaper Carrier Day gives all of us the opportunity to show appreciation for the reliable way in which these young people simplify our lives and make better lives for themselves by the job experience they acquire.
