I'm running for president. It's a big office. It's an important position — the most important political office on the planet. We knew it would be difficult, but we're going to continue on our message. We'll certainly answer questions and address falsehoods or anything people say, but I'm going to remain focused on the future of America, which is what this election needs to be about because this nation is at a generational point where it needs to choose what kind of country it's going to be in the 21st century. . . .
I'm going to continue to run a positive message for America's future. If there are policy differences between them, we should discuss them, not just with Jeb, but anybody on the field. But I'm not going to attack other Republicans — that would be doing Hillary Clinton's work for her.
