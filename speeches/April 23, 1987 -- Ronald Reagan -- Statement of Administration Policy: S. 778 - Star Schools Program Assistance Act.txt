    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) MA and 15 others)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 778. The bill authorizes a $100 million new program of grants by the Department of Education for demonstration programs to develop telecommunications networks, design and construct facilities, acquire equipment and satellite time, and train elementary and secondary teachers in the use of the technology in science, math and foreign language courses.
There is no evidence of any need for additional Federal investment in this area, and therefore, it is totally inappropriate to authorize this new Federal categorical program. The proposed program would duplicate ongoing telecommunications activities conducted by the National Science Foundation together with substantial State government and private sector involvement. It also would duplicate training and development activities under the Chapter 2 block grant of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act and the Education for Economic Security Act. Finally, additional construction is unnecessary because adequate telecommunications facilities already exist.
