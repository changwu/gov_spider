    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fields (R) Texas)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1558 in the form agreed to by the Committees on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and Armed Services because section 3 of the bill:

—   Raises constitutional issues by purporting to require the President to submit legislation to Congress.
—   Micromanages the manner in which certain recommendations are to be made to the President. Such requirements interfere with the flexibility necessary to effectively manage the Executive branch. 
The Administration has no objection to the remainder of the bill and would not oppose H.R. 1558 if these problems were eliminated.
