    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gilman (R) NY and 22 others)
The Administration has no objection to H.R. 512.
H.R. 512 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
