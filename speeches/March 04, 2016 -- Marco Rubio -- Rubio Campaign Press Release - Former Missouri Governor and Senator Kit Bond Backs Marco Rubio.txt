Today, former Missouri Governor and U.S. Senator Kit Bond announced he is backing Marco. Conservative leaders across the country continue to rally behind Marco's vision for a New American Century.
Bond is backing Marco because he wants to see the American Dream reach more people:
I've carefully looked at all the candidates running for President and it's clear to me that Marco Rubio is the strong conservative we need as our nominee. As a former Governor and Senator, I know about leadership, and I've come to see that Marco is a born leader who will steer our country in the right direction.
I was privileged to serve in the Senate while Ronald Reagan was President and it's clear to me that Marco has many of the qualities that President Reagan had. Marco's vision about the greatness of America and the possibilities of the American Dream fall right in line with what Reagan believed, and that's what the United States needs now more than ever from our Commander-in-Chief.
I spent nearly four decades in public service fighting every day to expand opportunities for my constituents, and I'm confident that Marco Rubio will continue that fight for all Americans as our president. I am proud to be endorsing him and hope Missourians will join with me in supporting him on March 15.
Kit Bond served two terms as Governor of Missouri, from 1973 to 1977 and from 1981 to 1985. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, where he held office for four terms. While serving in the Senate, Bond was a strong advocate for a well-equipped U.S. military and fought to improve care for our nations veterans and for men and women currently serving.
