    President Obama will welcome President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain to the White House on Tuesday, October 13. Spain and the United States enjoy strong bilateral relations and partner together around the world to promote peace, and prosperity. Spain, a NATO ally and holder of the EU Presidency in the first half of 2010, is a strong contributor to the NATO mission in Afghanistan as we fight together against Al Qaeda and its extremist allies. The President looks forward to consulting with President Zapatero on a broad range of strategic issues of mutual concern, including implementing our shared strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, working together to promote the global economic recovery and food security, and advancing our goals with regard to Iran, Middle East peace efforts, and climate change.
