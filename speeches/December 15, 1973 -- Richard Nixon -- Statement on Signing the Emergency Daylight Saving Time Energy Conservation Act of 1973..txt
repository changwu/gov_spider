    I AM pleased to sign today H.R. 11324, placing the United States on daylight saving time for a period of approximately 2 years, beginning at 2 a.m., Sunday, January 6, 1974.
We have taken a number of actions to meet the energy crisis, and more will have to be taken. Many require inconvenience and sacrifice. But daylight saving time on a year-round basis, which will result in the conservation during the winter months of an estimated equivalent of 150,000 barrels of oil a day, will mean only a minimum of inconvenience and will involve equal participation by all. Unlike many of our other initiatives to deal with the energy crisis and to accomplish the goal of self-sufficiency in energy through Project Independence, these savings will not require research, new technology, diplomacy, or exploration.
I am delighted that the Congress has moved expeditiously in providing this method of helping to meet the energy shortage, and I am hopeful that we might see equally expeditious action on the more complex and far-reaching legislation which we must have to deal with this problem.
I call upon the Congress to complete action before the recess on Responsible bills to provide the energy emergency authorities we need to deal with the problem and to give a statutory base to the Federal Energy Administration to provide the necessary focused leadership.
