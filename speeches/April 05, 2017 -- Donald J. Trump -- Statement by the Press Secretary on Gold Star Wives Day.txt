    On this day in 1945, nearing the end of World War II, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt helped convene the Gold Star Wives organization in response to the incredible sacrifices made by the spouses and families of our Greatest Generation's soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsman, and veterans who died in service or as a result of their service-connected disabilities. From that day forward, the Gold Star Wives of America, a Congressionally chartered non-profit service organization, has provided services, support, and unconditional love to wives and families of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
Gold Star Wives and their families bear a unique burden imposed by war and conflict. Because of the sacrifices of their loved ones, we are able to put our children to bed at night in a free country. Our Nation owes them a debt that we can never repay, but we will never cease to honor them, and we will fulfill the obligations and promises we have made to them as a result of all they have sacrificed.
