    I learned with great regret today from my good friend, Senator Howard Baker, that he intends to retire from the Senate at the end of his present term in 1984.
Senator Baker's retirement will be a great loss to America. Certainly he has been one of the finest, most skillful majority leaders of this century. For me, personally, he has long been a wise counsellor, an invaluable ally, and a trusted partner and friend.
I know my feelings are echoed by the Members of the Senate, from both sides of the aisle, who have enjoyed serving with this man of extraordinary insight, fairness, and good will. We all look forward to continuing to work with him for the balance of the term.
And I know that Howard and I will remain close working friends and collaborators even after his retirement from the Senate. His vision and leadership are great national assets, and we'll certainly continue to draw on them.
