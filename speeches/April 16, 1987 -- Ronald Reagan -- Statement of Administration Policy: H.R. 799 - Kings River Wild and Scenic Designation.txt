    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lehman (D) California and 138 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 799. While the administration supports designation of the Kings River as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, as provided by section 1 of H.R. 799, section 2, which was added by the House Interior Committee, is objectionable.
Section 2 of H.R. 799 would (1) establish the Kings River Special Management Area on lands now part of the Sequoia and Sierra National Forests; (2) prohibit commercial timber production, mining, and mineral leasing in the area; (3) modify the existing geographical boundary between the two National Forests so that the entire area would be in the Sierra National Forest; (4) require construction of a $3.4 million, 17-mile trail in the area, and (5) grant a 13-mile segment of the main stem of the Kings River -the same protection from development that would apply if it were designated as part of the National Wild and Scenic River System.
The administration opposes section 2 because (1) designation of the Special Management Area would preempt the statutorily required land management planning process, unnecessarily restrict land management options, and impose excessive management costs; (2) unlike the current boundary between the two National Forests, the new boundary would not follow geographical features, hampering efficient land management; (3) the new 17-mile trail required in the area, over extremely steep and rocky terrain, is unnecessary and would cost an amount equal to about one-half of the entire National Forest System trail construction budget for 1988; and (4) the "special protection" granted the 13-mile segment of the river's main stem is tantamount to wild and scenic designation, and is premature pending completion of an ongoing study of a possible future dam.
