    Earlier today, I called President Mubarak of Egypt to offer our Nation's condolences to the families of those killed in the terrorist assault at Luxor this morning. The United States deplores and condemns this attack against innocent tourists. Once again, we are reminded of a painful truth: Terrorism is a global threat. No nation is immune. That is why all nations must redouble our commitment to fight this scourge together.
