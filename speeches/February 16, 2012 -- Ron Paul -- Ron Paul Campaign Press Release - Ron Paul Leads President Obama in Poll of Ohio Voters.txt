LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul bests President Obama in a head-to-head matchup in the key swing state of Ohio according to a new Fox News poll.
Paul beats the President 42 percent to 41 percent among Ohio voters according to the poll.
"As President Obama continues on his failed path to bigger government resulting in high deficits, high unemployment, and rising prices, Ron Paul is the lone voice of reason with a plan to cut $1 trillion dollars from the federal budget in one year," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"Ohio voters, like all voters, are concerned about our nation's future and understand that Congressman Paul is the best person to be our next President, as he will enact real spending cuts and put us back on the path to prosperity."
The results are based on a telephone survey conducted February 11th through the 13th with a random sample of 505 registered voters living in Ohio.
The full results of the poll can be found here.
This comes on the heels of a PPP poll which showed Ron Paul the most competitive GOP contender among independent voters.
