    I commend the House for passing the Defense Authorization conference report and showing strong bipartisan support for America's national security, our troops, and their families. This bill includes my request for a third straight pay raise, more resources for equipment and training, and quality of life improvements so that our military continues to be the finest fighting force in the world.
The legislation also makes good progress toward transforming and modernizing our military so that it is best prepared to protect Americans.
Finally, I am pleased that the House has resolved the issue of concurrent receipt for military retirees in a fair and responsible manner.
