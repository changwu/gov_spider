Biden blamed law enforcement for "escalating tension" while rioters set fire to court houses.
In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, President Trump made it clear that he stands with the majority of Americans who support peaceful protests and the use of the National Guard to end the violence.
But for months, Joe Biden failed to stand up to the far-left rioters and looters, and failed to support the police officers protecting innocent Americans.


In the wake of the violence in Portland, Biden called the rioters and arsonists "peaceful protesters" while shockingly blaming law enforcement for "stoking the fires of division."


Biden said he would not send the National Guard into cities and states where left-wing mobs were rioting.


Joe Biden all but accused police officers of being responsible for the riots, claiming they were "escalating tension."


Biden's campaign even helped bail violent criminals out of jail, including a murderer, a rapist, and a rioter who shot at police.


It's obvious that law-abiding Americans will be on their own if Biden and his far-left mob are elected in November.
