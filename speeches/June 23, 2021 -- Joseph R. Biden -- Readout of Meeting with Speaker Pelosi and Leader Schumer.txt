    Today, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer met with Office of Management Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice to discuss the President's legislative priorities, including the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. They agreed that Congress must meet the President's goal of investing in creating a generation of good paying jobs, addressing the climate crisis, and ensuring American workers and businesses can compete globally, while not raising taxes on anyone who makes under $400,000. They underscored the importance of extending the child tax credit, and investing in the care economy, including expanding child care, to help ensure that women can return to the workforce. They discussed the two-track approach, and the importance of a budget resolution to meeting the full range of the President's priorities.
