    To the Congress of the United States:
I submit herewith the Second Annual Report on National Housing Goals, as required by Section 1603 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.
In the past year, this Administration has undertaken an extensive analysis of our housing goals and the prospects for meeting them. This analysis suggests that the construction and rehabilitation of 26 million housing units in a decade--including 6 million for families with low and moderate income--should meet the nation's needs, and is consistent with other urgent claims on our productive resources. This volume of housing can be produced if we follow appropriate policies.
In line with the statutory requirement, the attached Report presents a revised production plan to achieve the housing goals. Such planning is helpful in providing a guideline by which to measure our progress toward meeting the nation's increasingly urgent housing needs. It should be emphasized, however, that projections eight years into the future must be considered flexible, regardless of the apparent precision of the planning schedule.
The record of the past year makes clear that continuing efforts on many fronts are required to provide a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family. The Administration. Congress, private industry and labor cooperate closely in removing and making the commitments to meet our housing objective the framework of sustainable growth.
