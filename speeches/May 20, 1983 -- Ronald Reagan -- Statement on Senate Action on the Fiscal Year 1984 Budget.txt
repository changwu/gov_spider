    Last Tuesday [President's news conference of May 17] I said to the Nation:1
"It is time to draw the line and stand up for the people. I will not support a budget resolution that raises taxes while we are coming out of a recession. I will veto any tax bill that would do this; and I will veto spending bills that would rekindle the fires of inflation and high interest rates. The American people did not send us to Washington to continue raising their taxes, spending more on wasteful programs, or weakening our defense. They sent us here to stop that."
I meant it then, and I mean it now.
