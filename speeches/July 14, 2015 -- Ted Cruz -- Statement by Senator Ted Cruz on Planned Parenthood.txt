    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement regarding recent reports that Planned Parenthood is selling body parts of aborted babies:
"Today's news regarding allegations that Planned Parenthood is possibly selling the body parts of the babies it has aborted is sickening.
"There is no place for taxpayer funding of organizations that profit from taking away innocent life, much less profiting off the bodies of the lives they have stolen. Congress should immediately begin an investigation of Planned Parenthood's activities regarding the sale and transfer of aborted body parts, including who is obtaining them and what they are being used for. And it should renew efforts to fully defund Planned Parenthood to ensure that its morally bankrupt business receives not one penny of taxpayer money.
"I proudly stand on the side of life and remain committed to fighting for all innocent life to be valued and protected under the laws of this nation."
