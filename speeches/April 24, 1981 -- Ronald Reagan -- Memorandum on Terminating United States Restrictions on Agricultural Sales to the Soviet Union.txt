    Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
I have today directed the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with you and other appropriate officials, to immediately terminate the current restrictions on the export of agricultural commodities and products to the Soviet Union imposed under authority of the Export Administration Act pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce of January 7, 1980. I have also directed that the restrictions be terminated which were imposed on the export of phosphate rock and related commodities by virtue of the regulations of the Department of Commerce published on February 7, 1980.
