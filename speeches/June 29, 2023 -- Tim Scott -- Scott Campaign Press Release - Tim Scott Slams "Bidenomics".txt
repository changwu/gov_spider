Julie Banderas: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeting that Biden's policies have been an economic disaster. Another congressman writing, inflation reaches 40 year highs. This is Bidenomics folks. We are not in a place where you can really, quite frankly, be bragging about this economy. I mean, Democrats love to talk about how wages are up. Let's talk about inflation. Let's talk about interest rates. Let's talk about the fact that young people can't buy new homes and they can't get mortgages because the interest rates are astronomical. That's not a positive economy to be bragging about.
Tim Scott: What we need to do as American People, fire Joe Biden and hire Tim Scott. Let's talk about Joe Biden's economy, $10,000 is the amount of money the average family has lost since Joe Biden has taken office. Why? Because when inflation hits 16% since he's taken office, that means that the average family today is experiencing a crisis. When your gas price goes up 40%, and your food's up 20%, and your electricity costs $2,200 more this year than it did last year, it is a crisis. The last thing we need to hear is Joe Biden doing anything other than saying to the American people, 'I'm sorry, I have no clue how to run this economy. I resign.' He's not gonna say that. So the American people are gonna have to kick him out.
