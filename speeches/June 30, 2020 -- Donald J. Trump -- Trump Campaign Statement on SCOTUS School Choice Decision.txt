    "Today's Supreme Court ruling deeming it unconstitutional to ban religious schools from receiving state aid is a victory for educational freedom, religious liberty, and families across the country. No child in America should be denied the right to high-quality education because of their zip code. While Democrats like Joe Biden oppose school choice and champion policies that would doom children to failing schools, President Trump has advocated for policies that allow more children to attend the school of their choice, which has especially benefited lower-income and minority communities. President Trump is working to build the most inclusive economy in American history, and that begins with giving children across the country unprecedented access to a quality education and the American Dream."
