    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Texas and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding during the period of June 16-18, 2007.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Cooke, Coryell, Denton, Grayson, Lampasas, and Tarrant.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kenneth Clark as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
