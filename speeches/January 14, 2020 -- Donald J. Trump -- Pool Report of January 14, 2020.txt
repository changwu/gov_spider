In town pool report #3 / motorcade leaving WH 
After a bad weather call forced the cancellation of Marine One's flight, pool loaded onto vans and the presidential motorcade was rolling for JBA at 4:51 p.m.
Your pooler saw Stephen Miller waiting at the south portico and then walking alongside the motorcade before departure, but did not see whether he entered a vehicle.

In town pool report #4 / JBA arrival and AF1 
The motorcade arrived at Joint Base Andrews and at 5:15 p.m. president Trump ascended the stairs to Air Force One, which rolled off into an eerie bluish mist.
The pool is holding in vans awaiting our return to the WH, and is now handing off to travel pool for the flight to Milwaukee.

In town pool report #5 / JBA return 
Following a second bad weather call, as fog hung low late into the evening, the pool made its way to JBA but was unable to access the tarmac in time to see the president disembark or to join in the motorcade.
The pool watched from inside the base as the motorcade passed and proceeded to the highway at 11:45pm.
A spokesman said the president returned to the White House at 12:03pm.

The motorcade pulled up at JBA at 5:14 p.m. POTUS exited the car wearing a dark suit and blue tie and holding what looked like a rolled up newspaper. He boarded the plane without talking to reporters, but stopped to wave before walking inside. Pool didn't spot anyone else boarding the plane.

Travel Pool 3 - arrival at arena 
Motorcade arrived at the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena at 6:34 p.m. after about a 15-minute drive.
Pool spotted a couple dozen onlookers watching the motorcade drive by, waving and taking pictures. It is a rather brisk 35 degrees in Milwaukee.
Pool entered the arena at 6:36 and did not see POTUS enter. Outside the arena was a loud contingent of protesters and a large balloon. There also appeared to be some supporters next to the protesters.
The rally is open press but pool will send along a few highlights. VP Pence is currently speaking.

Travel Pool 3 - POTUS begins 
POTUS took the stage at 7:03 p.m. to "God Bless the U.S.A." and screaming cheers.
The seats in the arena are packed, and the pen in the center of the arena is mostly filled. There are a couple of American flags hanging on the walls and a few more television screens displaying the flag. Signs with "Keep America Great" or advertising the campaign number supporters can text are portrayed on about a dozen screens around the arena.
POTUS begins by recounting that in Wisconsin, "we had a very big night a few years ago."

Travel Pool 4 
At 7:14 p.m., a protester whom pool couldn't see interrupted the rally, as the crowd loudly booed and chanted "TRUMP" and "USA." The same thing happened with a different protester a few minutes later.
Another protester a little later tossed his sign into the press pen as he was escorted out. It was a Bernie sign with "TRUMP FEARS" scrawled in black at the top.
Some other highlights from the audience:
- When POTUS talked about Benghazi, the crowd began chanting "Lock her up!"
- A couple audience members shouted "Where's Hunter" when POTUS brought up Joe Biden

The President reaffirmed United States support for a cooperative, sustainable, and mutually beneficial agreement among the parties. The President emphasized that the United States wants to see all of these countries thrive and expressed hope that each country will take this opportunity to work together so that future generations may succeed and benefit from critical water resources.
