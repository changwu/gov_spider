    As Sunshine Week begins, I want to applaud everyone who has worked to increase transparency in Government and recommit my administration to be the most open and transparent ever, an effort that will strengthen our democracy and ensure the public's trust in their Government.
We came to Washington to change the way business was done, and part of that was making ourselves accountable to the American people by opening up our Government. We've put our White House visitor records on the Internet for the first time in history, opened up more Government information than ever before on data.gov, recovery.gov, and USAspending.gov, and issued an Executive order fighting unnecessary secrecy, to name a few.
We are proud of these accomplishments, but our work is not done. We will continue to work toward an unmatched level of transparency, participation, and accountability across the entire administration.
