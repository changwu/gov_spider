    On behalf of all Americans, I want to extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to Prime Minister Peres and the people of Israel. Our prayers are with them at this terrible moment, especially the families and friends of those killed and wounded in Jerusalem and Ashkelon.
These brutal acts of terror, which once again have taken the lives of innocent Israelis and at least one American citizen, offend the conscience of the world. They must not only be condemned; they must be brought to an end. The enemies of peace have once more attempted to turn back progress toward a new Middle East in which Arabs and Israelis may live in peace. But they have not and will not succeed. Their dark vision is of the past, not the present; of violence, not hope for a better future.
At this tragic moment, the U.S. stands alongside Israel and with all the peacemakers, as together we continue our work for a comprehensive and lasting settlement for all the peoples of the Middle East.
