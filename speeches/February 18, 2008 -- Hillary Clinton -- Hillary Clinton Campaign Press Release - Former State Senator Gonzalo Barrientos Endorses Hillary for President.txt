    Former State Senator Barrientos joins other Latino Officials in Backing Clinton
Texas - Citing her 35 years of strength and experience, former State Senator Gonzalo Barrientos endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.
"Hillary has a long history fighting for the American people and I am proud to support her today. Whether working to protect voter rights or fighting for universal health care, Hillary has consistently demonstrated that she values the issues that are important to the Hispanic community. We need a leader who has the strength and experience to lead on day one. Hillary doesn't just talk about change, she delivers change. My brothers and sisters, I urge you to stand in support of Hillary, so together we can help make history."
"Senator Barrientos is a true leader in the Hispanic community and I am honored to have his support," said Clinton. "I look forward to working with Gonzalo as I travel across Texas and appreciate his guidance and friendship."
Barrientos is a leading voice within the Hispanic community throughout the state. A former Democratic member of the Texas Senate, Barrientos represented the 14th District from 1985 to 2007. He was also a member of the Texas House of Representatives from Austin from 1975 to 1985.
Barrientos endorsement is just another example of how the Clinton campaign continues to gain momentum across the state. More than 100,000 Texans have committed to volunteering for Hillary and hundreds more are signing up daily. Last night, more than 4,700 people attended a campaign rally with former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton campaign's Austin Headquarters in support of Hillary.
