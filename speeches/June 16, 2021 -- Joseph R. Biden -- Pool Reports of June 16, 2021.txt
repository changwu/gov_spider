Geneva, Switzerland
June 16, 2021
Good morning from Geneva.
It's a beautiful sunny day. Highs are expected in the 80s.
Your pool is gathered at POTUS' hotel for the departure of the motorcade shortly.
The much anticipated meeting between President Biden and President Putin will be held this afternoon at Villa La Grange, an 18th century villa located in a park. More information on the villa and surrounding park where we will spend our day can be found here: https://www.geneve.ch/en/parc-villa-grange

Geneva, Switzerland
June 16, 2021
At 1:23 pm, Swiss President Guy Parmelin emerged along with US and Russian presidents. Putin, wearing a dark suit with what looked like a purple tood to the left and Biden, wearing a blue tie, to the right.
Biden and Putin did not speak. Will send the Swiss leaders remarks shortly.
At the moment, the US and Russian pools are standing at the door.of the villa. We are not being allowed in because everyone is pushing and shoving. Authorities have threatened to keep us out. Unclear if we will miss the remarks.
Service is extremely bad. Apologies for the delay.

Geneva, Switzerland
June 16, 2021
There's an extremely chaotic scene at the door. Both pools being denied access.
At 1:39 pm, part of the pool was ushered in but we were pushed and shoved by security officials and Russian media. Poolers tripped over cords.
Inside, a pooler shouted Mt President, do you trust Putin? Biden nodded yes up and down. Another pooler asked Putin if he feared Navalny and what he would do if Ukraine joined NATO. He looked up and did not respond.

Travel pool report #6 
Geneva, Switzerland
June 16, 2021
Prior to the arrival of the poolers at the front of the villa, other media were already standing in front of the door.
Thanks to Andrew Restuccia of the WSJ for providing this:
Mr. Putin arrived at the villa at 1:03 p.m., and got out of the car at 1:04 pm. He was greeted by Swiss President Guy Parmelin, whose country is hosting the summit. The two men chatted briefly and posed for photos. Mr Putin did not make remarks, but he waved to reporters before entering the villa.
Mr. Biden arrived separately at 1:18 pm. He stayed in the car for a minute, removing his sunglasses. After exiting his vehicle, Mr. Biden posed for photos with Mr. Parmelin. He smiled broadly, but didn't respond to shouted questions from reporters.

It is an honor and a pleasure for Switzerland to host you here for this summit and, in accordance with its tradition of good offices, promote dialog and mutual understanding. I wish you both a fruitful meeting in the interest of your two countries and the world. Best wishes and goodbye"

Travel pool report #8 
Geneva, Switzerland
June 16, 2021
Here's more of a description of the villa as the pool was waiting:
The shoving match began at a side entrance immediately as the two presidents entered the villa from the front door. Journalists from both countries rushed to enter the building but were stopped by US and Russian security and government officials. The pool was repeatedly told to line up separately and in single file but neither side did. Instead, the journalists pushed and shoved trying to enter the building. There was screaming and yelling as a Swiss official kept asking everyone to be quiet. Poolers was told by the US and Russia officials several times that they would not be allowed inside unless everyone was orderly. That never happened. White House officials repeatedly tried to get the US pool inside, saying that the US and Russia had agreed on the numbers. Meanwhile, we learned while standing there that the leaders had started speaking without media inside the room. Finally at 1:39 pm, nine of the 13-member US pool got into the room.

Travel pool report #9 
Geneva, Switzerland
June 16, 2021
Here's more of a description from inside the room:
Biden and Putin were seated in a library with books lining at least three of the walls. The two presidents had a small wooden table in between them. Flowers were on the table. A large globe was just behind the table. Large US and Russian flags were erected on each side of the globe.
Biden was seated with his legs crossed. To his right, a female interpreter sat in a chair. To her right, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was seated.
Putin was seated with his hands on his legs. To his left, a female interpreter sat in a chair. To her left was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
The media scuffle was the most chaotic your pooler has seen at a presidential event in nine years. Journalists pushed and shoved, yelling at each other to move but no one did. After just a minute or two, Russian security pulled the red rope separating the media from the leaders back to try to keep them away from the presidents. Russian security yelled at journalists to get out and began pushing journalists. Journalists and White House officials screamed back that the Russian security should stop touching us. Your pooler was pushed multiple times, nearly to the ground, as many poolers tripped over the red rope, which was now almost to the ground.
Both presidents watched and listened to the media scuffle in front of them. They appeared amused by the scene. At one point, Biden leaned over and spoke to the interpreter and smiled.

Travel pool report #11 
Geneva
June 16, 2021
Providing a little more context to an earlier report:
AP's Jonathan Lemire asked Putin if he feared Navalny and what he would do if Ukraine joined NATO. Putin looked up and did not respond.
NBC's Elyse Perlmutter asked Biden if he trusted Putin. Biden looked at her and nodded in the affirmative.
Press Secretary Jen Psaki sends the pool this statement:
"During a chaotic free for all with members of the press shouting questions over each other, the President gave a general head nod in the direction of the media. He wasn't responding to any question or anything other than the chaos."
Thanks to NBC for sending some of the remarks that the pool missed at the very stop of what was to be the pool spray.

Travel pool report #17 
Geneva
June 16, 2021
From a White House Official:
President Biden gifted President Putin a crystal sculpture of an American Bison by Steuben Glass of New York, a stately interpretation of one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience. In 2016, it was officially named the national mammal of the United States when the Obama-Biden Administration signed the National Bison Legacy Act into law. In Russia, over the past 20 years, European bison were reintroduced by rewilding numerous sites after their extinction in 1927. The sculpture will be presented on a cherry wood base, symbolic of our nation's first president, George Washington, with a custom engraved inscription plaque commemorating the meeting between President Biden and President Putin.
President Biden also gifted President Putin a pair of custom Aviators made by Randolph USA. In 1978, Randolph joined forces with the U.S. military to produce the HGU-4/P Aviator designed for fighter pilots. They have since provided the U.S. military and NATO partners with their high-level, durable aviators, manufactured domestically in their Massachusetts factory.
