    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about the health care plan Governor Mitt Romney is announcing today.
"Mitt Romney's cure is worse than the disease. Not surprisingly, he's unwilling to take on the big insurance and drug companies. As a result, it will make a dysfunctional health care system even worse.
"Governor Romney's tax deductions will help the high-income and healthy the most, at the expense of the millions of uninsured Americans who need help the most. It will encourage businesses to drop worker coverage -- forcing families into the dysfunctional individual market with high premiums and out-of-pocket costs -- and may even increase the number of uninsured Americans. Taking money away from emergency rooms is downright dangerous. And by turning his back on universal coverage, Governor Romney is also turning his back on effective ways to bring down health care costs such as check-ups, preventive medicine, and managing chronic diseases.
"There are 45 million Americans without health insurance, and many live shorter, less healthy lives as a result. If universal health care was good enough for Massachusetts, why isn't it good enough for the rest of the country?"
