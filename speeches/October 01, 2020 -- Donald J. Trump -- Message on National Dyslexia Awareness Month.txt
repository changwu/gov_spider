    This National Dyslexia Awareness Month, the First Lady and I join our fellow Americans in recognizing those countless individuals who have enriched our country while also living with dyslexia. Together, we commit to continuing to improve our learning environments, expand innovation in our workplaces, and strengthen our communities to ensure these individuals can seize every opportunity to achieve success and prosperity and to contribute to greatness of our country.
Dyslexia affects Americans of all backgrounds and does not distinguish between persons of different races, ethnicities, sexes, ZIP Codes, or socioeconomic backgrounds. Millions of men, women, and children adapt their everyday routines to overcome this most common language-based learning disability. Students are particularly affected by the challenges associated with reading and writing that are caused by dyslexia. This month, we thank the educators, the administrators, and most importantly, the parents who continue to work tirelessly in their efforts to give every child the resources they need to overcome this disability and continue to learn, grow, and become confident in their abilities and potential. And we salute all the students who refuse to give in and who work every day to overcome dyslexia to achieve educational success.
This October, let us resolve to ensure that future generations affected by dyslexia have even more opportunities to strengthen their communities, workplaces, and country.
