    FIRST, I want to congratulate the Multiple Sclerosis Society for its long and very helpful record of trying to highlight the problems relating to MS and also to make the American people aware of the great courage and strength of people such as you, Mrs. Van Meter and Mr. Rikard.
I do wish to congratulate you, and it's an honor for me to give you this plaque as Mother of the Year. We are delighted to have you here and are very glad that you could be here.
And you, Mr. Rikard, I'm very pleased to award you this plaque as the Father of the Year for MS. Good luck, and God bless you. It's nice to have you here.
We're delighted to have somebody from Alabama and somebody from Iowa. The very best to both of you.
I congratulate the members of the society and what you have done and what I know you will do in the months and years ahead.
The best to all of you. We are very grateful, on behalf of 215 million Americans, for the achievements in the past as well as well into the future.
The very best to you.
