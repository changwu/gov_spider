    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Smith (R) Michigan and Gekas (R) Pennsylvania)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 4718, which would extend the provisions of the bankruptcy code (chapter 12) that address the particular needs of family farmers in financial distress. As the President stated when he signed a previous temporary extension of chapter 12, the Administration urges the Congress to make these provisions permanent.
