    My dear Mr. Chairman:
Attached is a draft of legislation which would permit General George C. Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense. I request that you lay this matter before your Committee with a view to obtaining early and favorable action by the Congress.
I am a firm believer in the general principle that our defense establishment should be headed by a civilian. However, in view of the present critical circumstances and of General Marshall's unusual qualifications, I believe that the national interest will be served best by making an exception in this Case. I am sending a similar letter to--
Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
