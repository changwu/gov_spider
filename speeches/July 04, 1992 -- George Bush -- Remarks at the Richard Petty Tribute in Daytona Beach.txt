    Thank you all very much. I can think of no better place to wish our Nation happy Independence Day, happy Fourth of July, than standing right here with this patriotic, wonderful turnout of people, all-American crowd. Thank you very much.
This is the day when we celebrate our independence and count our blessings. The way I see it, yes, there are problems, but we are still the freest, fairest, and the greatest country on the face of the Earth.
I just met with the NASCAR drivers, a real thrill for a sports fan. They epitomize the best: the best in sportsmanship, the best in family, the best in patriotic values. So today, on the Fourth of July, this President comes not only to greet the American people and the fans here, but this President comes to greet a king, Richard Petty, one of the great Americans. Richard, I'm proud to be at your side.
