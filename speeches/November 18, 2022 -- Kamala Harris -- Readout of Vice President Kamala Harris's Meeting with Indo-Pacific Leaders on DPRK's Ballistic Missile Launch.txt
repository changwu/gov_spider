    Vice President Kamala Harris convened today Indo-Pacific leaders on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand. In addition to the Vice President, the meeting included: Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Prime Minister Han of the Republic of Korea, Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Ardern of New Zealand, and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada. They met to consult closely on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s test of a long-range ballistic missile earlier today. They agreed that, together with their national security teams, they would continue to assess the situation in close coordination with other allies and partners. They agreed that this launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions and the leaders called on all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC Resolutions. The leaders reaffirmed that a DPRK nuclear test would be met with a strong and resolute response from the international community. They reiterated that the path to dialogue remains open for the DPRK, and they called on the DPRK to abandon needless provocation and to return to serious and sustained diplomacy.
