    I am outraged by the callous murder by the IRA of two policemen in Northern Ireland. I condemn this brutal act of terrorism in the strongest possible terms. There can be no reason, no excuse for these vicious crimes. I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of the two slain officers.
There is nothing patriotic or heroic about these cowardly killings. The overwhelming majority of the people of Ireland, North and South, join me in repudiating violence and murder. They know that a just and lasting peace is only possible through painstaking dialog and negotiation. Further violence can only play into the hands of those responsible for the vicious murders of the two policemen. The true heroes and patriots are the many people of both communities who work tirelessly and peacefully for reconciliation and understanding. I will continue to do all I can to support their efforts and the efforts of the political leaders participating in the Belfast peace talks.
