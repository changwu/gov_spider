In 1971 and 1972, Seignious served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Security Assistance) and director of the Defense Security Assistance Agency. From 1972 to 1974, he was Director of the Joint Staff for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He retired from the Army in 1974, and since then has been president of The Citadel.
