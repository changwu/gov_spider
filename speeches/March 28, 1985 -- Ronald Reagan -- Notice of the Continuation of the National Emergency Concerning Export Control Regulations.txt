    On March 30, 1984, by Executive Order No. 12470, I declared a national emergency to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Because the Export Administration Act has not been replaced by the Congress, the national emergency declared on March 30, 1984, must continue in effect beyond March 30, 1985. Therefore, in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency in order to deal with the threat posed by the unrestricted access of foreign parties to United States commercial goods, technology, and technical data and by certain boycott practices of foreign nations. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
