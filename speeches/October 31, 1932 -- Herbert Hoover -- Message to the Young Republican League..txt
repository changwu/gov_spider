My dear Miss Summers:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the members of the Young Republican League, and my warm appreciation of their powerful aid in this campaign. The Republican Party has always recognized the spirited political energy of the younger men and women as a vital force in shaping its policies and fighting its battles in behalf of constructive and forward-looking government. That battle today is at the critical hour, when every battalion should swing into line for the final charge to victory. Yours should be a ringing call to arms.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Miss Jean Summers, Secretary, Young Republican League, Republican National Committee, Palmer House, Chicago, Illinois]
