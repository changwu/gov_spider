    I have reviewed the medical and dental records of President George W. Bush covering the period from 1968-1973. I concur with the examining doctors and dentists that the President was fit for entry into officer training school, fit for undergraduate pilot training and fit for continued flying duties through his last annual flight physical, which expired on July 6, 1972. The records reflect no disqualifying medical information.
