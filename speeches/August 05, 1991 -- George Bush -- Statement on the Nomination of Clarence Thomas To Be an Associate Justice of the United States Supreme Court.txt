    Judge Clarence Thomas, accompanied by Senator Jack Danforth, has met individually with almost 60 Members of the Senate. Fred McClure, our Director of Legislative Affairs, informs me that these visits have gone very well.
Judge Thomas has attracted the support of a broad spectrum of people from across America. With the overwhelming support that is now showing up for Judge Thomas, in measurable ways, not only in the minority communities but across the board, you can see that he is much closer to the mainstream of America than some of the groups that are opposing him.
I look forward to having the hearings begin on September 10 on my nomination of Judge Thomas. The American people are going to see, and the Senate will confirm, that Judge Thomas is the right person to earn the title "Mr. Justice."
