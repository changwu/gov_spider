    The President spoke by phone today with Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom to discuss Syria and the upcoming London Conference on Supporting Syria and the Region, which the Prime Minister will co-host with other world leaders on February 4. President Obama reiterated the commitment of the United States to continue to support those displaced by the violence in Syria and elsewhere in the region, as well as to help alleviate the pressures in Europe created by the unprecedented inflow of refugees. He informed the Prime Minister that the United States will be represented at the Conference by Secretary of State John Kerry, who will announce significant new contributions to support relief efforts, and discussed plans relating to the Refugee Summit he will host at the UN General Assembly in September. The two leaders also conferred over the situation in Syria and the need for concrete steps to improve humanitarian access and build confidence in support of the political process. Finally, they noted ongoing efforts to resolve the political impasse in Libya, and Prime Minister Cameron updated President Obama on his negotiations with European Union leaders to reform the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union. The President reaffirmed continued U.S. support for a strong United Kingdom in a strong European Union.
