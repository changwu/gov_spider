    To President Gerald Ford:
You have made erroneous statements about my positions on several issues. First, I do not advocate increasing income taxes on low or middle income families. Second, I do not advocate eliminating the existing homeowner income tax benefits. Third, I do not advocate new spending programs which would cost anything near $100 billion. My pledge is to have a balanced budget by 1980, fiscal year 1981, and to phase in new programs only as funds become available through an expanding economy and improved government management. Fourth, I do not advocate a $15 billion reduction in the defense budget. My projected savings from efficiency and elimination of waste is from $5 billion to $7 billion. Knowing your belief in integrity I am sure that after these corrections you will refrain from making these misleading and erroneous statements to the American people.
Signed, Jimmy Carter.
