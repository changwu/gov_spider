    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on tonight's presidential debate: Â 
"Mitt Romney's debate performance tonight crystallized the choice voters face this November. When he is president, Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will deliver more jobs and more take-home pay. He will also implement real healthcare reform, restore fiscal sanity, deliver tax cuts for middle-class Americans and ensure peace through strength around the globe. That's a winning argument that will surely resonate with the millions of Americans who know they can't afford another four years like the last four years."
