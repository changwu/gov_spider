    The United States is saddened and angered by the deaths earlier today in an explosion during Victory Day celebrations in the town of Kaspiysk in the Russian Federation's Republic of Dagestan. Of particular concern is that this evil act of terrorism occurred on a holiday when Russia celebrates its World War II victory over fascism and at a time when our nations are allied once again in a war against global terror. Terrorism and the killing of innocents can never be condoned or justified.
On behalf of the American people, I extend my condolences to the families of the innocent children, veterans, and others killed, and I wish a full and fast recovery for those wounded in the incident.
