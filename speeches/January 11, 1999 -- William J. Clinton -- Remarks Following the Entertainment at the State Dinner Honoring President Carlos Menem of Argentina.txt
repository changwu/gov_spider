    President Clinton. Well, we want to say, first of all, thank you to our wonderful musicians, our magnificent dancers. I will never look at you again in quite the same way, Robert. [Laughter]
We are very grateful to you, and I hope, Mr. President, you feel a little more at home. Thank you, again.
