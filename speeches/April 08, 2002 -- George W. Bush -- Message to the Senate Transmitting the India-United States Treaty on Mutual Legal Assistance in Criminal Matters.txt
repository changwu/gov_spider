    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of India on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at New Delhi on October 17, 2001. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties that the United States has concluded or is negotiating in order to counter criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective tool to assist in the investigation and prosecution of a wide variety of modern crimes, including terrorism-related crimes, drug trafficking, and "white collar" crimes. The Treaty is self-executing.
The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters and related proceedings. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: (1) taking the testimony or statements of persons; (2) providing documents, records, and items of evidence; (3) locating or identifying persons or items; (4) serving documents; (5) transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; (6) executing requests for searches and seizures; (7) assisting in proceedings relating to seizure and forfeiture of assets, restitution, and collection of fines; and (8) rendering any other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the Requested State.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
