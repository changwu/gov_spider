    I am outraged by this deliberate attack on the people of Sarajevo. There can be no possible military justification for an attack against a marketplace where women, men, and children of the city were pursuing their everyday lives. The United Nations should urgently investigate this incident and clearly identify those who are guilty.
I have directed that Secretary Christopher engage our allies in Europe and the United Nations on the situation and on appropriate next steps. As he and Secretary of Defense Perry have stated, we rule nothing out.
I have also directed the Department of Defense to offer its assistance in evacuating, hospitalizing, and treating those injured in this savage attack.
I know I speak for all Americans in expressing our revulsion and anger at this cowardly act.
