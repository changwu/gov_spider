    Today the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary unanimously voted to give Judge Anthony M. Kennedy its highest rating of fitness for a Supreme Court Justiceâ€”a rating of "well qualified."
The President is very gratified by the ABA's announcement and believes that after concluding its hearings the Senate will agree with the assessment of the American Bar Association that Judge Kennedy possesses the highest qualifications to be a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
According to the ABA, this rating is "reserved for those who meet the highest standard of professional competence, judicial temperament and integrity. The person in this category must be among the best available for appointment to the Supreme Court." The ABA's decision followed a detailed examination of Judge Kennedy's professional qualifications, his writings, and his decisions on the bench, as well as extensive interviews with persons familiar with his record.
