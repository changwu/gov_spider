    Senator Kelly Ayotte today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW:
"Mitt Romney understands America's role as the leader of the free world. He will restore American influence and respect by bolstering our economy and ensuring that we have the strongest military in the world. Unfortunately, President Obama has abdicated his responsibility as Commander in Chief by sitting on his hands while our military faces draconian defense cuts, which will hollow out our force and leave our country increasingly vulnerable to determined enemies... Similarly troubling, the President's administration has presided over a series of reckless intelligence leaks that have compromised national security and put Americans and our allies in danger. We can't afford four more years of a president who believes America should 'lead from behind.' Mitt Romney will provide the strong leadership that this president has failed to deliver."
