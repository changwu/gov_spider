    On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order No. 12722, I declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iraq. By Executive Orders Nos. 12722 of August 2 and 12724 of August 9, 1990, I imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked Iraqi government assets. Similar sanctions were imposed against occupied Kuwait by Executive Orders Nos. 12723 and 12725 of August 2 and August 9, 1990, respectively, which were terminated by Executive Order No. 12771 of July 25, 1991. Because the Government of Iraq has continued its activities hostile to U.S. interests in the Middle East, the national emergency declared on August 2, 1990, and the measures adopted on August 2 and August 9, 1990, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond August 2, 1991. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Iraq.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
