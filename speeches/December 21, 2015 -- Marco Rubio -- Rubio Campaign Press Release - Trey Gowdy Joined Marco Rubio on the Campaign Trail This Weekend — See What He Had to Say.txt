He had this to say about Marco:
I can tell you, from my standpoint, as I have gotten to know Senator Rubio for the last 5 years, I haven't seen anybody who does a better job communicating principled conservatism in a hopeful way.


In a packed town hall, Marco outlined his vision for an America that can conquer the challenges of the 21st Century, and answered questions from the audience.
