    I just want to thank all of the outstanding legislators who are here and advocates. This is something that will save children's lives. Some people may know that Malia actually has a peanut allergy. She doesn't have asthma, but obviously, making sure that EpiPens are available in case of emergency in schools is something that every parent can understand. And thanks to the bipartisan work of the folks behind us and the advocacy communities that have been pushing this so hard, we're going to be giving States a lot more incentives to make sure that that happens. So I want to congratulate all of you.
