    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Wyoming and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by flooding during the period of June 4-18, 2010.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the flooding in Fremont County and the portions of the Wind River Indian Reservation that lie within Fremont County.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Steven S. Ward as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
