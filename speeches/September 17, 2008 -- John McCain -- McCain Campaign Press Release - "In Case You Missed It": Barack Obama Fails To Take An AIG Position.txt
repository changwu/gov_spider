Fox News' "Special Report"
September 17, 2008
Fox News' Brit Hume: "The Democrat is not coming down one way or another on the AIG rescue. Correspondent Major Garrett explains why." 
Fox News' Major Garrett: "On the biggest financial issue of the day, Barack Obama would not say if he supported or opposed the government-backed rescue of insurance giant AIG." 
Barack Obama: "We don't know all the details of the arrangement with AIG and the Federal Reserve must ensure that plans protect the families that count on insurance." 
Garrett: "Obama also wants taxpayers protected but executives and shareholders exposed but on the central question to intervene or not, Obama sidestepped. Advisers said lack of details forced caution. The larger political truth: advisors believe anxiety alone is enough to lift Obama in the polls. That is why on the trail, Obama doesn't talk about specifics of the moment but the nation's overall direction."
