    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee announced today that Congressman George Radanovich is supporting Mayor Giuliani for President. Congressman Radanovich's support is just the latest in a growing list of California endorsements which includes fellow Congressional members Mary Bono, David Dreier, Jerry Lewis, Devin Nunes, and Ed Royce.
"We need a proven leader with an optimistic vision who can unite our party and our country," said Congressman George Radanovich. "Rudy Giuliani is an experienced, decisive leader who will use the same conservative principles that led to New York City's revitalization to tackle the difficult issues our country faces today."
"I welcome Congressman Radanovich's support and look forward to working together to grow our California team," Mayor Giuliani said.
Congressman Radanovich has represented California's 19th district since 1994. He served as President of the historic, 74-member, 1994 House Republican Freshmen Class. Rep. Radanovich championed western water and land issues as a member of the Committee on Resources and as the chair of the Subcommittee on Water and Power. As a current member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Radanovich has worked to deal with telecom, healthcare, energy and air quality issues.
