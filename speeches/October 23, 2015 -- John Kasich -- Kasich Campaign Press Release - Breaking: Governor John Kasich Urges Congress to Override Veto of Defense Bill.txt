Gov. John Kasich Urges Congress to Override Veto of Defense Bill
Applauds Additional Funds for the Military
Today Ohio Governor John Kasich urged Congress to override President Obama's veto of the 2016 Defense Authorization Act and applauded Congress for setting aside budget limits to increase military spending. He called on congressional leaders to resist the President's call to water down the bill.
"The world is becoming more dangerous and more chaotic everyday because this President hasn't led on national security. His veto of badly needed new resources for our men and women in uniform--as well as a pay raise for them--was reckless and must be resisted by Congress. The bill rightly set aside budget limits so the military can get additional resources to begin rebuilding and I urge Congress to override the veto and keep fighting to make sure needed funds get to our troops," said Kasich.
Kasich served for 18 years on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee and has repeatedly called for lifting budget caps on defense spending to begin restoring and strengthening the Armed Forces.
