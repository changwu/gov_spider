    The United States welcomes the participation of more than sixty nations from across the globe in the first anniversary meeting of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), held in Krakow, Poland. One year ago, in announcing this initiative, President Bush emphasized the need for the international community to act effectively to stop the trade in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their related components. Today's meeting highlights the success of PSI in building a global network of countries willing to cooperate to prevent rogue states and non-state actors from acquiring WMD -- interdicting shipments at sea, in the air, and on land. PSI supporters are committed to take action, consistent with their national legal authorities and international law and frameworks, to disrupt this deadly traffic and to prosecute proliferators and bring them to justice. PSI has already achieved great success and now plays a central role in our overall efforts to counter WMD proliferation.
