    Today, Governor Bush was in South Carolina, fielding questions on a variety of topics at the Conservative Leadership Project's forum in Greenville. He was asked about the role of government in crisis.
The Democrats shamelessly took Governor Bush's response out of context.
It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush's comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions.
