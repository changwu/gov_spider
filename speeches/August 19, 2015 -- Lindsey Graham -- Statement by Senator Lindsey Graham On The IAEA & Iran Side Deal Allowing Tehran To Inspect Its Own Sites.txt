    Allowing the Iranians to inspect their own nuclear sites, particularly a notorious military site, is like allowing the inmates to run the jail. The inspections won't happen, can't be trusted, and clearly, put America at risk. This revelation is yet another example of how this deal, negotiated by the Obama Administration, is a dangerous capitulation to the Iranian regime. It will ensure that, within a very short amount of time, Iran becomes a nuclear threshold state.Â 
The president said, 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' I respectfully ask, how exactly will the world know when Tehran cheats, if we are dependent on the Iranians to tell us?
As a senator today, I will continue to fight to stop this bad deal, including by withholding money to the IAEA, if necessary. As president, I will negotiate a better deal with Iran that will truly protect our national security and the stability of the region.
