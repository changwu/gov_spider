    Yesterday on CBS, I said those who come here should want to be Americans â€” they should assimilate, roll up their sleeves and get to work. I said that immigration without assimilation is invasion. When did it become politically incorrect to say immigrants should want to be Americans? You either want to become an American and be all in, or you don't. Let's insist on being the melting pot. Let's forget this politically correct liberal notion that we're not a melting pot anymore.
