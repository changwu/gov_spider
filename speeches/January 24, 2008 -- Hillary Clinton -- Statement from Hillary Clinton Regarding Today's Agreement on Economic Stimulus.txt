    "I am heartened to see that Speaker Pelosi and the Bush Administration have reached an agreement on stimulus that would extend immediate tax rebates to more than 100 million hardworking Americans, including 35 million families who would have been left out under the Administration's initial proposal. I have been calling for extending tax rebates to these lower-income Americans, and will push to ensure that these families receive the full assistance that they need.
"In addition to fast-acting rebates for hardworking families, I believe that we need immediate measures to address the most pressing challenges our working families are facing in this economic downturn. We need a comprehensive approach to combating the housing crisis, which is dragging down our economy and threatening to foreclose the American Dream for millions of families. We need to expand and extend unemployment insurance to help those who are struggling to find a job. And we need to provide immediate relief from skyrocketing energy bills. I look forward to working with Leader Reid, Chairman Baucus and my Senate colleagues on a fast-acting, comprehensive stimulus package in the days and weeks ahead."
