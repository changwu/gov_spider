    Dear Mr. Chairman:
The provisions of the fiscal year 1989 Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts require that I submit to the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the "anticipated obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year 1989 for the Small ICBM, the MX Rail Garrison program, and other ICBM Modernization programs; and the purposes those obligations are intended to accomplish." Until April 3, 1989, I anticipate obligating no more than $250 million of the $600 million appropriated for the fiscal year 1989 MX Rail Garrison program.
Between now and April 3, we will be reviewing various ICBM modernization options in the context of my recently announced national security strategy review. The modernization of our land-based strategic forces has raised a number of issues that will necessitate consultations with you and other members of Congress before any final proposals are made on this critically important matter.
Sincerely,
George Bush
