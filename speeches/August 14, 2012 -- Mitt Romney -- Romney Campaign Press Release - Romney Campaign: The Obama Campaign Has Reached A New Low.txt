    Romney Campaign National Press Secretary Andrea Saul today made the following statement in response to Vice President Biden:
"After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama Campaign has reached a new low.  The comments made by the Vice President of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama Campaign will say and do anything to win this election.  President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden's comments."
