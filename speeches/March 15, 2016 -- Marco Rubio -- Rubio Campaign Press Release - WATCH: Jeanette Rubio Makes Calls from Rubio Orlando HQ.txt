    Behind the Scenes at Rubio HQ: Jeanette Is Making Calls
 
Volunteers all across Florida, and around the country, are doing their part to make today a great day for Marco. 
And Marco's wife Jeanette joined in, spending part of her morning calling voters to ask them to support Marco at the polls today!
MSNBC stopped by the Rubio HQ in Miami to see her making calls:

Jeanette is right: 
Nothing that's good is easy — and winning this for Marco and stopping a billionaire con artist won't be easy, but is absolutely necessary for our country and the next generation.
