    The Pawlenty for President campaign announced today that Bruce Keough, former New Hampshire State Senator and former Chairman of Board of Trustees for the University System of New Hampshire, has endorsed Gov. Tim Pawlenty for President. Keough will be serving on the Governor's National Policy Committee and will be joining his New Hampshire Steering Committee.
"Bruce Keough is an individual with a track record of fiscal discipline and accomplishment in both the public and private sector, and I am honored to receive his support," Gov.Pawlenty said. "I look forward to receiving his counsel on crafting much-needed common sense policy reforms to our nation's most pressing challenges."
"The tangled mess in Washington and the current shutdown in Minnesota demonstrate why America needs Gov. Tim Pawlenty's leadership," said Bruce Keough. "We've had enough of the President's inability to set priorities and make difficult choices. This only results in more out-of-control spending, more endless debt, and more ill-conceived health care mandates. I'm supporting Gov. Pawlenty because America needs a president who is going tell us the truth, not only about the challenges facing us but the solutions that are needed."
Keough, a private investor, served as State Senator from 1995 to 1997 and served on the University System board from 1997 to 2001. Keough also was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor in 2002. Bruce has served in volunteer leadership roles for a number of New Hampshire charities, initiatives and campaigns â€“ most recently as co-chairman of the New Hampshire Romney for President effort in 2007-08.
