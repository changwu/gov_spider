    First Lady Melania Trump will travel to Wyoming on Thursday, October 3rd to visit some of America's treasured national parks and spread the message of her initiative, BE BEST.
Earlier this month, alongside the National Park Services (NPS), Mrs. Trump and fourth grade students from a local DC school participated in the ceremonial grand reopening of the Washington Monument. Mrs. Trump also helped distribute "Every Kid Outdoors" passes, a program of NPS that provides students with free access to hundreds of America's beautiful national parks, lands, and waters.
The visit out west will focus on one of the First Lady's pillars of BE BEST – well-being – and encourage fourth graders to get a park pass from NPS.gov in order to spend time outdoors and learn more about the natural beauty of our country.
In her time as First Lady, Mrs. Trump has been a strong proponent of preserving national treasures so that people may enjoy and appreciate their historic value to the nation for generations to come. In addition to speaking with children about the value of getting out in nature and our national parks, this trip will highlight a few historic natural landmarks.
