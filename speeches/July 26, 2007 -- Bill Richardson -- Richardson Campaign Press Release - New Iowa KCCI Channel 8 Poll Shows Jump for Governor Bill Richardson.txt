    AMES, IA -- Today, Democratic Presidential candidate Governor Bill Richardson has jumped to 11% in a new Iowa KCCI Channel 8 Poll, a 4-point gain since May.
"This poll is consistent with the momentum we're seeing on the ground in Iowa," said campaign manager Dave Contarino. "The more Iowa voters get to know Governor Richardson, the more they like him. His experience, his vision for growing the economy and enacting universal healthcare, and his plan for getting all of our troops out of Iraq with no residual forces are resonating with voters everywhere. This poll reflects that."
Today's poll shows Governor Richardson with the most growth in support among all the candidates. It also shows him quickly closing in on Senator Obama.

The Research 2000 Iowa Poll was conducted July 23 to 25. It consisted of a statewide telephone interview of 600 likely Iowa voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Governor Richardson's campaign continues to pick up speed in Iowa. Just before Governor Richardson's solid performance at the CNN/YouTube debate, the campaign started running a new ad called "Heroes" in Iowa, detailing Governor Richardson's leadership of the national effort to raise death benefits for the families of fallen soldiers and his plans to give a "Heroes' Health Card" to our veterans, so they can get healthcare wherever and whenever they need it.
Governor Richardson continues to rise in the all-important early primary states. Today's poll comes on the heels of a CNN/KMUR/UNH poll, showing Governor Richardson ahead of John Edwards in New Hampshire.
"Our strategy of door-to-door, grassroots campaigning in the early primary states is paying off," said Contarino.
The pundits are starting to realize what the voters have known for awhile: Governor Richardson is a top-tier contender. A recent USA Election Polls article predicted an upset victory for Governor Richardson in Iowa.
