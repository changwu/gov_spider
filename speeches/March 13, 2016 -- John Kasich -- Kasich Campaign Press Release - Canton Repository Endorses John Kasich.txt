Even when he was among a crowded field of 17 Republican presidential candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich stood out as the most capable and qualified leader.
Kasich spent 18 years in Congress, serving as a member of the House Armed Services Committee and later as the chairman of the House Budget Committee. As governor, he enjoys strong support in the Buckeye State, according to poll numbers. He won nearly every county in Ohio during his bid for re-election in 2014. He has created more than 400,000 private-sector jobs and cut taxes by $5 billion.
Throughout his campaign, Kasich has shown his compassionate side, often talking about the people "in the shadows" â€” the poor, the drug-addicted and those suffering from mental illness. He has urged supporters to "slow down in life" and be better neighbors. In one of the darkest presidential campaigns in recent memory, when his opponents have resorted to name-calling and gutter politics, Kasich has stayed above the fray. His markedly positive campaign stands in sharp contrast to the campaigns of his three Republican primary rivals. Kasich's refusal to waver from this upbeat approach, even when it has cost him the spotlight, is refreshing, yet unfortunately too rare in American politics.
