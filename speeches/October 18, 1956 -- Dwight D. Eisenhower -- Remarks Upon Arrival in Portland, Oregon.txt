    My Fellow Citizens:
It is truly a pleasure to be with you today, and I must thank you, as does Mrs. Eisenhower, for coming out to give us such a cordial greeting.
We have been traveling since Tuesday afternoon, and our hearts have been warmed by this fact: everywhere the United States looks happy. It looks a darn sight happier than it did four years ago.
I don't know of anything more worthwhile than just to see Americans having a good time. You seem to be doing it, and I assure you, we are.
So, if everybody is happy, we will go along, and thank you very much for coming out.
