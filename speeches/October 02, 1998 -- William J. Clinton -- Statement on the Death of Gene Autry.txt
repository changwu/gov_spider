    Hillary and I are saddened to learn of the death of Gene Autry. An entire generation of Americans has lost a beloved old friend from childhood. Gene Autry's music and movies captured all that was good and inspiring about America's Old West. His characters taught children across America important lessons about courage and freedom, justice and fairplay. And in leaving behind a treasure trove of recordings, from "Back in the Saddle Again" to "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," America's First Singing Cowboy will sing forever. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Autry family.
