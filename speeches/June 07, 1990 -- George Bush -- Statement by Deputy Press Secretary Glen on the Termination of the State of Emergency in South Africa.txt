    We welcome the announcement of the ending of the state of emergency in South Africa, except in Natal. This is another significant step toward creating a climate conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic, nonracial South Africa. This announcement builds on earlier decisions by President de Klerk to release Nelson Mandela and certain other political prisoners, to unban the ANC [African National Congress] and other organizations, and to permit free political debate to take place in South Africa.
Much work remains to be done by all sides. The issue of the remaining political prisoners needs to be resolved. The continuing climate of violence and intimidation must be transformed. The senseless killings in Natal Province must end.
However, we are encouraged by the remarkable progress that has been made in recent months. With this latest move, the Government has moved to meet almost all of the opposition's requirements to enter into negotiations. We look forward to the early beginning of a negotiating process.
