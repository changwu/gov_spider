    Des Moines, IA -- The Obama Campaign today announced the 42-member Generation Obama Iowa (GO) Steering Committee which is composed of young professional Iowans who are playing a leading role in Senator Obama's effort to unite America to address the challenges our nation faces. Steering Committee members will lead efforts to grow GO Chapters across Iowa starting with kickoff events in Des Moines, Elkader, Davenport, Webster City, Iowa City, and Cedar Rapids tonight and in the coming weeks. These events are open to the press and the public.
"Barack Obama inspires me in a way no other politician has," State Representative Tyler Olson said. "His early stand against the war in Iraq and his message of hope motivate me to get involved and do what I can to ensure Barack Obama is our next President."
Here in Iowa, Generation Obama will engage young professionals by giving them the tools to become active participants in the Obama campaign and in their communities. Through caucus trainings, informational forums, house parties, fundraisers and more, GO Chapters will engage and empower young professionals across Iowa.
"Young people will play a vital role in shaping our campaign and transforming our country," Senator Obama said. "That's why I'm proud to have the support of these ambitious young Iowans who are tired of the status quo in Washington, D.C. and are ready for real change."
GO Chapters across the country are energizing young people to get involved in the political process and organize in their local communities. To learn more about Generation Obama and national outreach efforts to young professionals, click here.
