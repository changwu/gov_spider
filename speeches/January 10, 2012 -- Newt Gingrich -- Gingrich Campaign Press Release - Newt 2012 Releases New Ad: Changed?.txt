    Changed? Script
"What happened after Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney changed his position from pro-abortion to pro-life?" a female narrator asks as a picture of an unhappy-looking Romney fills the screen and spooky music plays. "He governed pro-abortion."
"Romney appointed a pro-abortion judge, expanded access to abortion pills, put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board. And Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions. Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney: He can't be trusted."
