    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about not being able to change Washington: Â 
"Last time around, Barack Obama ran on the slogan of 'change we can believe in.' But after four years of disappointments, even he doesn't believe in change. Or at least he doesn't believe in his ability to change things from the White House. In truth, he has changed many things. But it is hard to count any of them as improvements. No matter what direction one looks, the country is worse off than it was four years ago. It's time for a new direction, and we'll get that with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan."
