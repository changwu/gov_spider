(House)(Rep. Everett (R) AL and 16 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3458, which provides a cost-of-living adjustment for the beneficiaries of veterans' disability compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3458 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that the bill would decrease direct spending by $19.6 million in FY 1997 and by a total of $150.5 million during FYs 1997-2002.
