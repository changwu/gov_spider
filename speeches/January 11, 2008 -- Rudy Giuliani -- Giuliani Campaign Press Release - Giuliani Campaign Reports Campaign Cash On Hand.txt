    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that the campaign has over $12.7 million cash on hand, with over $7 million in primary dollars. These numbers were reported as of December 31st, the end of the last reporting period.
"From day one our campaign has been focused on a national strategy built around the new primary calendar. As such, we've budgeted conservatively and effectively targeted our resources to win under this new system. We will have the funds necessary to carry out our campaign plan and deliver the Mayor's message in Florida and beyond," said Giuliani Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime.
