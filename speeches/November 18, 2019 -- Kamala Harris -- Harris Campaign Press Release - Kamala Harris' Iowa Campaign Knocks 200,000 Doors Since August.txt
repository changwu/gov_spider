    Today, Kamala Harris' campaign in Iowa announced that organizers, volunteers, and supporters have officially knocked more than 200,000 doors across the state since August. The Harris campaign will continue to engage Iowans in face-to-face conversations on their doorsteps about Harris' record of fighting for justice for all Americans and her plans as President to fight for economic justice, reproductive justice, and health care justice, up until the caucus on February 3rd.
"I am so proud of the hustle of our team," said Harris Iowa Organizing Director Erin Phillips. "It's because of their energy and enthusiasm that we've been able to reach so many Iowans in every part of the state and engage them in personal conversations about why justice is on the ballot in this election and how Kamala Harris will fight for all Americans. Day by day and door by door, we are continuing to grow our network of supporters, volunteers, and precinct leaders that form the heart of our campaign."
Harris' campaign continues to organize in every county and every precinct across the state to build up the campaign's volunteer capacity and has invested heavily in the precinct-level organizing that is crucial for success on caucus night.
