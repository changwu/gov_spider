    President Bush. Mr. President, thank you very much, sir, for your gracious and warm hospitality. Madam, thank you very much. Mr. President, thank you for coming back from Germany today. Laura and I are touched. This has been a spectacular trip. It's not over, because tomorrow we're going to tour more of your country.
President Kikwete. You'll be——
President Bush. I'll be—[laughter]. But I must say that our trip here has exceeded my expectations. I knew you were an accomplished Government. After all, you've dramatically reduced malaria; you're in the process of dramatically reducing HIV/ AIDS. My country has awarded you the largest Millennium Challenge grant ever in the history of our Nation, all because your Government is committed to honest, decent government for the people.
I have been extremely touched, as has Laura, by the outpouring of support by the great people of Tanzania. And so, Mr. President, I too would like to propose a toast: To you and your family, to the people of Tanzania, and to our friendship, may it be long lasting.
