    When the military took power in Turkey under conditions of near anarchy in 1980, they committed themselves to restoring democratic government as soon as possible. The United States welcomed the timetable they set for carrying out that promise, and we have expressed our support for each step along the way. I warmly welcome President Evren's recent announcement that parliamentary elections will be held on November 6, thus completing the process of restoring democracy. I congratulate the Turkish people for this remarkable achievement and assure them of the continued support and friendship of the United States Government and people.
