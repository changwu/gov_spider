    During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the confirmation of U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Robert Bork to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, which concluded yesterday, 63 individuals appeared in his behalf. These 63 individuals and the groups they represent demonstrate the broad-based support Judge Bork's confirmation enjoys. Endorsements from such an impressive array of, among others, former high government officials, members of the legal establishment, and academics are a testament to Judge Bork's outstanding qualifications to serve as an Associate Justice and conclusively illustrate the great respect his judicial philosophy commands.
