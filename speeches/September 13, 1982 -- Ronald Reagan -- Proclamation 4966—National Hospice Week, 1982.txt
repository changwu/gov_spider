  A Proclamation

The hospice concept is rapidly becoming a part of the Nation's health care system. To direct the Nation's attention to the value of hospice care, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 24, 1982 (SJ. Res. 170, Public Law 97-182), requested that the President proclaim the week of November 7 through November 14, 1982, as National Hospice Week.
Hospice provides a humanitarian way for a terminally ill patient to approach death with dignity, in relative comfort in a supportive atmosphere, and surrounded by family members. Its most important element is concern for patients and their families. Hospice advocates personal care and concern, living comfortably until death, the absence of pain, maintenance of personal control, and the close .fellowship of the family unit.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 7, 1982, as National Hospice Week. I urge all citizens, government agencies, the medical community, and appropriate private organizations to observe the week with forums, programs, and activities designed to encourage national recognition and support for the hospice care concept.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 13th. day of Sept, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
