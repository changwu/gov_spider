    On Labor Day, America rightly salutes her working men and women and celebrates their outstanding contributions to our Nation and the world.
From our factories and mines to our construction sites, American labor has led the world in efficiency, productivity, and innovation. American workers, by their matchless ingenuity and resourcefulness, have pioneered advances in aviation, defense, and telecommunications, so it is not surprising that "Made in the U.S.A." remains a universally recognized symbol of quality craftsmanship.
Ever since the first Labor Day parade in New York 110 years ago, this holiday has been one of justifiable celebration and pride, and it remains so today. History shows the extraordinary courage and resilience of the American people, and I know that, by working together, we will overcome the challenges that lie before us -- just as we have met every trial in the past.
While our challenges are great, we must remember that our opportunities -- and our determination -- are greater. The United States will continue to push for free and fair trade, because expanding markets for our goods and services will create jobs. This Administration will also continue to ease the burden on our economy that is caused by excessive Federal regulation and to promote incentives for savings and investment through tax credits and the creation of Enterprise Zones. To help our citizens prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, we are moving forward with America 2000, our National strategy to achieve excellence in our schools.
If there be any solemnity to this Labor Day, let it be only for the passing of summer, because everything else that this day represents -- from the spirit of the American worker to the fundamental strength of our free enterprise system -- should be a source of pride and hope for all Americans.
