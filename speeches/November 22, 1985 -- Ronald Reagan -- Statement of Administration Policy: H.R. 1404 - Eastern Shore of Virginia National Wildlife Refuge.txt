    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Representative Bateman (R) Virginia)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1404, because:
— the area is not undergoing rapid development, so there is no major threat to the wildlife habitat;
— other areas are of higher priority for limited Federal acquisition funds; and
— adequate training facilities for Fish and Wildlife Service personnel and the general public already exist, so there is no need for the new national training center required by the bill.
