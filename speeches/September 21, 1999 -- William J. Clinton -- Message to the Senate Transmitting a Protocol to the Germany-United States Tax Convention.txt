    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances, and Gifts signed at Bonn on December 3, 1980, signed at Washington, December 14, 1998. The Protocol provides a pro rata unified tax credit to the estate of a German domiciliary for purposes of computing U.S. estate tax. It allows a limited U.S. "marital deduction" for certain estates of limited value if the surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen. In addition, the Protocol expands the United States jurisdiction to tax its citizens and certain former citizens and longterm residents and makes other changes to the treaty to more closely reflect current U.S. treaty policy.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 21, 1999.
