    NEW YORK â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders extended his victory streak on Saturday when he won the Wyoming caucuses, his eighth victory in the last nine contests.
Alright, news bulletin. We just won Wyoming! We appreciate and thank the people of Wyoming so much for their support. --Bernie Sanders
Sanders won the caucuses over Hillary Clinton, who pundits had cast as a prohibitive favorite when the campaign began.
He was speaking to a rally at LaGuardia Community College when his wife, Jane, went on stage to tell him the news.
"Alright, news bulletin. We just won Wyoming," Sanders said to cheers. "We appreciate and thank the people of Wyoming so much for their support," Sanders added.
Sanders comments on Wyoming came as he was campaigning in Queens and other boroughs of New York City in advance of the next Democratic Party primary. There are 247-pledged delegates at stake when New York Democrats go to the polls on April 19.
Sanders has been pulling closer to Clinton in the state she represented in the Senate and where he was born and raised.
Nationwide, Sanders leads Clinton in two of the past three polls. He also fared much better than Clinton in match-ups with Donald Trump and the other remaining Republican White House hopefuls.
