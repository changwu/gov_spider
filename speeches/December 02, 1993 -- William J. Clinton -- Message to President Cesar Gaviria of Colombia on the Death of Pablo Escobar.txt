    Dear Mr. President:
I just learned of the success of your long struggle to bring Pablo Escobar to justice. I want to offer my congratulations to you and the Colombian security forces for your courageous and effective work in this case. Hundreds of Colombians, brave police officers and innocent people, lost their lives as a result of Escobar's terrorism. Your work honors the memory of all of these victims. We are proud of the firm stand you have taken, and I pledge to you our continued cooperation in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
