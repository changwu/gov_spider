    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period June 1 to July 31, 1998. The previous submission covered events during April to May 1998.
Landings of combat aircraft on Cyprus by Greece and Turkey in mid-July escalated tensions in the region and complicated efforts to reach a bizonal, bicommunal settlement on the island. Despite this, we intensified our efforts to restart the negotiating process. United States representatives underscored my concern with the leaders of both Cypriot communities as well as Greek and Turkish officials and urged all parties to concentrate on ways to take those steps that will lead to solving the Cyprus problem.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued two reports on the U.N. Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and the U.N. Mission of Good Offices in Cyprus (copies enclosed). Thereafter, the U.N. Security Council adopted two resolutions, one renewing the UNFICYP mandate for a 6-month period and another endorsing the Secretary-General's Good Offices Mission (copies enclosed).
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
