    Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John M. Shalikashvili and I met this morning to discuss his report concerning the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The report argues persuasively that ratifying the CTBT would increase our national security and that the security benefits of the treaty outweigh any perceived disadvantages.
The report's recommendations address concerns raised during the October 1999 Senate debate over CTBT. I urge Congress and the incoming Bush administration to act on them.
I also hope the Senate will take up the treaty at an early date as a critical component of a bipartisan nonproliferation policy. CTBT is supported by our friends and allies overseas and designed to reduce existing nuclear dangers as well as those that might emerge in the future.
I commend General Shalikashvili for his thorough and rigorous report and his continued service to the Nation.
