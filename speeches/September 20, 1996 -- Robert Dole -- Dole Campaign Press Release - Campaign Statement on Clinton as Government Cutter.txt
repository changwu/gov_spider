    Dole/Kemp Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"You'd have to believe in the tooth fairy to believe Bill Clinton has cut big government. Under Bill Clinton, taxes have hit their highest level in history, there are more new regulations than any point since Jimmy Carter was President, and the federal government has actually added 5,100 non-defense employees,
"Clinton's assertion is particularly preposterous considering that the defining initiative of his presidency was the mother of all new government programs -- his failed attempt to nationalize our health care system and create a massive new bureaucracy.
"Most people driving through the Western states enjoy the scenic views. Bill Clinton seems to have spent his time thinking up new things to tax. Just this week, Clinton's own Secretary of the Interior proposed a new 'outdoors' tax on almost all equipment used by campers hikers, sportsmen, and outdoorsmen. On the Clinton 'tax tour,' nobody is safe."
