    Mitt Romney's Special Adviser on Foreign Policy and former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman made the following statement after tonight's debate in Washington, DC:
"I believe Mitt Romney clearly won tonight's debate with a compelling presentation of a foreign policy based on American strength and resolve. The United States and the international system are at an inflection point as they face the prospect of new nuclear-armed powers like Iran and North Korea, a rising China, the continued terrorism of radical Jihadism, and a turbulent Middle East. Mitt Romney understands that this is a dangerous time for America to shrink our military, retreat from the world, or defer to other actors. All Americans can rest assured that Governor Romney will secure both our interests and ideals with a strong national defense, resolute diplomacy, and a renewal of American leadership."
