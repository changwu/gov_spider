    I will soon send to the Senate my nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
From building a lasting peace in Bosnia to searching for a political settlement in Kosovo to finding a workable solution in Cyprus, Richard C. Holbrooke's intellect, vigor, and diplomatic skills have significantly advanced the values and interests of the American people.
At a time when international crises, from Iraq to Kosovo, demand the leadership of the United States and the United Nations, it is essential that we have a strong and capable diplomat like Richard C. Holbrooke as our U.N. Ambassador. He is extraordinarily well qualified for this vital position, and I look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of his nomination.
