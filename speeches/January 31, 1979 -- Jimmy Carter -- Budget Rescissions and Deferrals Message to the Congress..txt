    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report ten proposals to rescind a total of $914.6 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting six new deferrals of budget authority totalling $1,169.8 million and six revisions to previously transmitted deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $28.8 million.
The rescission proposals affect programs in the Departments of Energy, Health, Education and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, and several independent agencies.
The new deferrals and revisions to existing deferrals involve programs of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, the Interior, Justice, Labor, Transportation, the Treasury, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
