    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Condit (D) CA)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 111.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 111 would affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
