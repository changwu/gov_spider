    Both USA Today/Suffolk and Quinnipiac have released polls in the past 48 hours showing John Kasich as the Republican in the best position to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election -- and by significant margins.
This morning, 'Morning Joe' highlighted the significant margin Kasich holds over Clinton.


What They're Saying:
"[The USA Today/Suffolk] national poll of likely voters shows John Kasich emerging as the most acceptable GOP candidate to beat Dems in general."
-David Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center
"On the Republican side, who is the most electable? It's John Kasich. He clearly does the best against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the general election."
-Susan Page, Washington Bureau Chief of USA Today
