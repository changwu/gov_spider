    Chicago, IL - Senator Obama released the following statement today in response to the tragic cyclone in Burma.
"My heart goes out to the people of Burma who have lost loved ones or otherwise been tragically affected by the cyclone that devastated Burma this past weekend.
I support the Administration's plan to deploy a disaster assistance response team to Burma to assess the needs of Burma's people, and I urge the Burmese government to allow our team access so that we can move quickly and expeditiously in coordination with others in the international community to get help to those who most need it. Although the regime in Burma is one whose repressive rule deserves our condemnation, I also strongly believe that humanitarian assistance should not be used as a political tool against those in need."
