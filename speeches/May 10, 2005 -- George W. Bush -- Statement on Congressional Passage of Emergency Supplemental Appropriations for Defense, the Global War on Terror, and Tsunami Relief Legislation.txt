    I applaud the Congress for its strong bipartisan support for our troops and our continued effort to win the war on terror. New democracies are taking root in Iraq and Afghanistan, and America is proud to stand with them. This legislation will help America continue to promote freedom and democracy. It also will assist in the continuing tsunami recovery efforts. I appreciate the leadership in the House and Senate for working together to reach a final agreement that focuses taxpayer dollars on providing our troops and diplomats with the tools they need. I look forward to signing the bill into law.
