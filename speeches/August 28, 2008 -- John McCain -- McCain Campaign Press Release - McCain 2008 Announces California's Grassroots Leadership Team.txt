    TORRANCE, CA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced California's Grassroots Leadership Team. This team of local California leaders will help organize and manage the campaign's grassroots efforts, including the "Get-Out-The-Vote" turnout operation, in each county and city across the State of California.
"John McCain is a proven and tested leader. His long record of service is a testament to the fact that he has, and will continue to work tirelessly for the American people. He has proved that he will always act with the best interests of our Nation in mind, regardless of whether or not it is politically expedient. That is leadership we Californians can trust," said Andrea Jones, California State Director for John McCain.
"Sen. McCain's 'all of the above' solution to our current energy crisis and his pro-business tax policy will encourage small business growth and bring back jobs and stability to our economy," said Robert Laurie, Northern Region Chair for John McCain. "California's entrepreneurial spirit with thrive again with a McCain presidency."
Each of California's 58 counties will have a designated chairman at the local level to serve as points of contact for local volunteers and supporters. Fred Hildebrand and Gabriel Groves will assist new volunteers in joining grassroots efforts as the Northern California and Southern California Volunteer Coordinators, respectively. Additionally, Gayle Pacheco, the California Coalition Director, and her Coalition Leadership Team will also support local volunteer activities at the grassroots level. All will work to communicate John McCain's message of country first, national security, stronger economy and government reform. [All county and city chairs are listed below.]
