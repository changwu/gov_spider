    NEW YORK â€” The country is facing a mass incarceration crisis, with far too many people serving time for low-level and non-violent offenses. As mayor of New York City, Mike Bloomberg pushed for reform efforts that drove down incarceration by nearly 40% and worked to get New York State laws changed to end arrests for low-level possessions. Mike believes that no one should have their life ruined for possessing or smoking marijuana.
As president, Mike will sign a law decriminalizing possession and use of small amounts of marijuana. He will commute existing sentences for those crimes and expunge criminal records. Mike listens to science, and the science on marijuana urges a "go slow" approach until we have better medical evidence on its negative health effects. As president, Mike will have the federal government invest more in the needed research.
