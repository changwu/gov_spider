    Gerry Solomon was a true patriot. A decorated veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, he was a tireless advocate of the men and women of the United States military who continued to work to protect the interests of America's veterans long after his service in the U.S. Congress ended. Gerry Solomon will always be remembered as true to his creed: duty, honor, country.
