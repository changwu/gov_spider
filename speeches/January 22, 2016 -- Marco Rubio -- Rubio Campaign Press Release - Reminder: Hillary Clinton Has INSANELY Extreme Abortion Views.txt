Today is the March for Life, the largest gathering of pro-life activists every year.

It marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
Roe v. Wade claimed abortion for essentially any reason at any time in America was a constitutional right.
Marco has called the decision legally and morally bankrupt.

Marco will defend innocent life as President, as he's done his whole career. 

Meanwhile, Democrats hold extreme views on abortion.

Hillary is no exception. Let's run through her record:
She opposed the successful bipartisan effort to end the gruesome practice of partial birth abortion.

She wants your taxpayer dollars spent on abortions in America.
That's been barred by federal law for decades.

She believes we should fund groups that perform abortion overseas, like Planned Parenthood.

She defends abortions after 20 weeks, when infants are fully formed babies who can feel pain.

She supported Democratic efforts to risk a government shutdown in order to keep sending millions to Planned Parenthood.

She thinks the evidence of horrifying practices at Planned Parenthood are just a right-wing "attack."

Hillary's views are extreme. Marco looks forward to exposing them, and defending the rights of the unborn as president.
