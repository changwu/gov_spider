Ohio's Gov. John Kasich is a hawk who served for 18 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before, at the urging of Republican party leaders, he ran for the office of governor in Ohio. He was re-elected to a second term in 2014 in a landslide vote, winning with a lead of 30 percentage points.

On the top issues in the 2016 debates, Kasich, the grandson of an immigrant, is the sole Republican candidate to be open to a path for immigrants to stay legally in the country. The other two remaining Republican candidates, Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Ted Cruz, are extremists on the important topic of immigration. For many, in this election, eliminating the terrifying candidates leaves only Gentleman John Kasich in the running.
He's on the ball, too, when it comes to protecting freedom. The man has a healthy opinion on domestic surveillance. "I think there's a balance between good intelligence and the need to protect Americans from what can become an aggressive government somewhere down the road," he said.

Lastly, he believes in the importance of the individual in representative government. As the Republican party struggles to find itself, Kasich is a man with his head on his shoulders and decades of experience that have led to a willingness to work with those on the other side of the political divide.
Vote for Kasich.
