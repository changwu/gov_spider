    NEW YORK â€” Andrew Yang will host an unprecedented marathon online Q&A on Friday, October 18, 2019. He will answer questions live for 10 hours, splitting time between a multiplatform livestream and posting answers online using channels including Twitter's new Q&A service.
Yang built the beginnings of his campaign on long-form interviews, a format that allows for comprehensive and thoughtful answers that focus on solutions to our problems instead of soundbites. While there are sure to be lighthearted moments, Yang expects to discuss serious issues related to the economy, LGBTQ equality, the environment, health care, the opioid crisis, and education, among other topics raised by voters.
The Q&A will run from 10am through 8pm ET. Participants can access the Q&A from Yang2020.com or the campaign's channels on Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube. Questions can be submitted at Yang2020.com.
