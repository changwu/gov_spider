    Mrs. Johnson and I know the heavy burden so many are bearing. We are deeply grieved by the tragedy at the University yesterday. Our hearts go out to the families involved and to all who are suffering. We want to assure you of any personal or official assistance that would in any way be helpful.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
