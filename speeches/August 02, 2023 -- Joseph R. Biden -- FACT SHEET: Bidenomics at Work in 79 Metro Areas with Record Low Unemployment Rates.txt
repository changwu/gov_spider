    This morning, the latest metro area unemployment rates were released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing 79 metro areas at their lowest rates on record including 41 that reached new record lows. The record lows can be found in every corner of the country, from Scranton to Spokane, from Manchester to Montgomery.
White House Press Secretary Jean-Pierre congratulated all of the communities helping to drive the strength of our national economy:
"The heart of Bidenomics is growing our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down, and the 79 communities at record low unemployment show Bidenomics in action. With wages and consumer confidence going up, record numbers of Americans applying to start small businesses, and new factories being built in every corner of the country, America's communities are being rebuilt around good jobs for the long term."
President Biden's agenda has driven the strongest economic recovery America has ever seen, with 13.2 million jobs added, a record number of states with unemployment rates at or below 3%, and the national unemployment rate below 4% for the longest stretch in more than 50 years. Economic growth has been strong even as annual inflation has fallen for twelve straight months. At the same time, the President's Investing in America agenda is already taking hold, with more than $500 billion in new manufacturing and clean energy investments pouring in across the country, while shovels hit the ground rebuilding every state's infrastructure.
President Biden will continue to invest in America's communities, and continue to be a president for all Americans. See the full lists of metro areas with new record low unemployment rates and matching record lows below:
