    Yesterday, dozens of state and local leaders and organizations across the country praised President Joe Biden's proposed investments in the American Families Plan to create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program. Governors, mayors, state lawmakers from across the country highlighted the urgent need to support workers and families by making this critical investment to promote equity – and in turn, strength – of our economy.
Here is what they are saying: 
Governors
Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont: "Like @SecMartyWalsh said, paid family and medical leave ensures that no person has to make the choice between saving the life of a loved one or their life savings." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf: "The option to take leave to tend to a sick family member, care for a newborn, or grieve the loss of a loved one should be a right –– not a luxury. Thank you to @POTUS for prioritizing paid leave for all workers in the American Families Plan." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham: "#PaidLeave keeps mothers in the workforce, increases labor force participation and supports economic growth. I signed guaranteed paid sick leave into law in New Mexico. And I support a national program and @POTUS ' American Families Plan. Workers expect and deserve this dignity." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Democratic Governors Association: "Democratic governors are leading to charge to make #PaidLeave a reality at the state level — in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Colorado, California, Oregon, and Washington. Now it's time to pass the American Families Plan." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Mayors
National Conference of Democratic Mayors: "As a former mayor, @SecMartyWalsh knows firsthand that a community is strongest when families are supported. America needs paid leave across the board." [Tweet, 6/9/21]
National Conference of Democratic Mayors: "The U.S. is one of the only nations in the world that doesn't guarantee #PaidLeave. Our families — and our economy — simply deserve better. @POTUS' #AmericanFamiliesPlan sets us on the right path." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley: "Dayton was the first major Ohio city to pass paid parental leave for city employees. Nearly 1 in 4 mothers return to work within 2 weeks of giving birth.

State Lawmakers

Indiana State Senator Shelli Yoder: "Workers lost $22.5 billion in wages last year because we're missing critical social infrastructure. Parental paid leave has been shown to keep mothers in the workforce, increase labor force participation and boost economic growth. As we head out of this pandemic, we've seen first-hand that our social safety net is filled with holes. The rich & powerful tend to be fine when their business goes under, but when working people need parental or medical leave, it regularly halts their career. Investing in our families is a top priority of mine and the American Families Plan will do just that. Creating a comprehensive paid leave program that provides up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, I'm proud to support the AFP and hope our congressional delegation will do the right thing for working Hoosiers. #AmericanFamiliesPlan" [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Indiana State Senator J.D. Ford: "Parental paid leave has been shown to keep mothers in the workforce, increase labor force participation and boost economic growth while lack of paid leave options cost workers $22.5 billion in lost wages each year. The #AmericanFamiliesPlan is an investment in our families, creating a comprehensive paid leave program that provides up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. I'm proud to support it, and hope our congressional delegation will do the right thing for working Hoosiers." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Indiana State Senator Jean Breaux: "The next step in protecting working parents is establishing a national parental and medical paid leave program, and the Biden Administration is working to do just that." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
Indiana State Senator Greg Taylor: Workers lose $22.5 billion a year due to lack of paid leave, and that affects our entire nation. Check out how President Biden's American Families Plan world address paid leave in our country." [Tweet, 6/10/21]
