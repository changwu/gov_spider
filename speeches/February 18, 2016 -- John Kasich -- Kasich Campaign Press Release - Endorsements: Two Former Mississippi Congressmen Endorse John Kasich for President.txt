    Today, two former Mississippi Congressmen – Webb Franklin and Mike Parker –announced they have joined Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign as members of the Kasich for America Leadership Team. Both Franklin and Parker served with Kasich in Congress.
Said Franklin, "John and I were elected in the same class to Congress. I think he was the youngest member of the class. I know he was the smartest. I am proud to endorse my friend and former colleague for president."

Congressman Webb Franklin represented Mississippi's 2nd District from 1983-1986
Said Parker, "There is only one candidate in this race that will bring people together and get things done as president, and that's Gov. John Kasich. I served alongside him as he led the effort to balance the federal budget, and there's no one I trust more to restore economic vitality in this country."

Congressman Mike Parker represented Mississippi's 4th District from 1989-1998.
Said Kasich, "I'm grateful to have the support of Webb Franklin and Mike Parker. As former colleagues of mine and respected public servants, they both understand what it takes to reach across the aisle and unify people around commonsense solutions. I am thankful for their help as we spread that message far and wide across Mississippi."
