    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about President Bush's comments on taxes during his press conference today.
"Today, George Bush suggested that his priority on taxes would be, yet again, to help some of the wealthiest American investors and businesses. I couldn't disagree more. A month ago, I announced a plan to reward work, not just wealth, by taxing private equity and hedge funds fairly. That means no more special privileges -- charging income tax rates on the fund managers' incomes and corporate tax rates when funds go public.
"My plan to bring the tax code back in line with American values will prioritize tax cuts for the real engine of the American economy: the middle-class and working families who go to work every day and deserve to keep more of their paychecks."
