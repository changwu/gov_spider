    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack today in the city of Hilla, Iraq, which initial reports indicate killed at least 80 people and wounded many more. Many of those killed were pilgrims, including from Iran, returning from commemorating the Shi'a observance of Arbaeen in the city of Karbala. The United States extends its deepest sympathies to the families of the victims, as well as to all of Iraq, for this senseless violence, which was clearly intended to stoke sectarian tensions. The United States remains steadfast in its partnership with the Iraqi people and government, and this attack only serves to strengthen our resolve in defeating ISIL.
