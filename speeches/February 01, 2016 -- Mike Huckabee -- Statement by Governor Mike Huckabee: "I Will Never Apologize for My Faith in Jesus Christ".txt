    We've abandoned the building blocks of civilization. Life, marriage and family issues aren't bargaining chips or political considerations. They are moral issues.
I will never apologize for my faith in Jesus Christ, my convictions or my values. Period.
Life begins at conception. This isn't just a Biblical view â€” it's affirmed by modern science and every unique human DNA schedule, which is present at conception.
As Governor, I promoted and signed a fetal protection act. I imposed a ban on partial birth abortion, established waiting periods, created parental notification requirements, and passed a bill so mothers who brought a newborn to a hospital or fire station would not be prosecuted for child abandonment.
I may stand alone, but I am absolutely faithful to the issue of marriage. Not because it's politically expedient, but because it's the Biblical position, the historical position and the right position. We must defend, protect and preserve traditional marriage.
Conviction, moral clarity and integrity matters, and the people of Iowa know I will never say one thing in Marshalltown, Iowa and another in Manhattan.
Our grassroots team of Iowa families, farmers, teachers, activists and volunteers is energized and excited for victory on caucus night.
