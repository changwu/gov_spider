    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards today responded to President Bush's threat to veto any deadlines for ending the the war in Iraq.
"If President Bush vetoes funding for the troops, he will be the one who is blocking funding for the troops. Nobody else.
"Now is not a time to back down; it is a time for strength and conviction. The President's veto threat should only strengthen our resolve to stand by our troops and end this conflict.
"The Congress should make absolutely clear that they are going to stand their ground, supporting the troops and reflecting the will of the American people to end this war. If the President vetoes a funding bill, Congress should send him another bill that funds the troops, brings them home, and ends the war. And if he vetoes that one, they should send him another that does the same thing."
