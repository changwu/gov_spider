'This Time' transcript:
Amy Klobuchar: If we don't stop Donald Trump this time, shame on us.
Americans deserve a President who has their back; who isn't afraid to take on powerful forces; who has a record of bringing people together. And most importantly, who gets things done.
I know what it takes to win in the Midwest. It's not flyover country to me -- it's home.
I'm Amy Klobuchar. I approve this message because we need a president who can win -- for all of us.
