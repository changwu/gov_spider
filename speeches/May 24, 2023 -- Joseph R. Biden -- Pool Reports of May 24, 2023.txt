Intown pool report 6
The Uvalde remarks were at the base of the grand staircase with 21 candles honoring the 19 children and two
teachers. The president spoke for 7 minutes and 30 seconds in a soft and somber tone. He spoke of the grief of the families and the horror of the nation enduring so may mass shootings. He repeated his call for an assault weapons and a ban on large capacity clips. He didd not answer one question on debt negotiations. Quotes to follow.

In town pool report #7
Not knowing how much you could see on television, the scene at the base of the Grand Staircase was both simple and moving. Twenty-one tall white candles, 11 on the left and 10 on the right, represented the victims. On each candle was the name of one victim in script. Before making his remarks, the president, holding the first lady's hand, looked at the display of candles. The first lady touched some of them. The president looked down somberly.
He then moved to the lectern, starting out in an almost inaudible and soft voice before gaining strength. You saw the remarks, so will only touch on the quotes and the tenor. He started by calling it "a tough day" for those who lost loved ones. He recalled his trip to Uvalde in the wake of the shootings and how he "stood before 21 crosses." He talked of how young the children were and noted that even a year later the feelings are "raw." In the year since, he said, "too many schools, too many everyday places have become killing fields."
He recalled that many begged him to "do something" about the carnage. "We did something afterward, but not nearly enough," he said, noting the passage of a gun measure, but again calling for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He said there have been "a staggering 650 mass shootings" in the days since Uvalde and urged both Congress and state legislatures to consider more "common sense gun safety laws." He asked "how many more mothers will live their worst nightmares before" there is action. "It is time to act," he declared.
