    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Representative Reid (D) Nevada)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3352, which would require the Secretary of the Interior to give nearly 6,900 acres of Federal land to the City of Mesquite, Nevada, because there is no compelling reason to give away Federal property. It would also be unfair to other localities that have purchased Federal land under existing law in similar situations. Finally, most of this land is covered by mining claims, which might require conveyance to the claimants, and some of the land has already left Federal ownership.
