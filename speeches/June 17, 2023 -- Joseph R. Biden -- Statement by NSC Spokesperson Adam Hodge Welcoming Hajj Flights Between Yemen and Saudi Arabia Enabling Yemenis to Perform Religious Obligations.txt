    From the earliest days of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States prioritized de-escalating and ultimately ending the conflict in Yemen through diplomatic engagements. The UN-brokered truce that began in March 2022 has now brought nearly 15 months of calm to the people of Yemen. This is the quietest period since the war began almost a decade ago. U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking, National Security Council's Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk, and other senior U.S. officials spent the last week in the Middle East focused on expanding the truce in Yemen and other issues. We credit Saudi Arabia for its efforts to support the truce over recent months, including the historic hajj flights today that enable Yemenis to perform their religious obligations and other flights soon to follow. The United States remains engaged with all parties to consolidate the ongoing benefits from truce, and to ultimately end the war altogether through a Yemeni-led political process.
