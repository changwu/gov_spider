    A Look At Why Sen. McCain Voted Against The Bush Tax Cuts
"In 2001, Sen. McCain argued, 'I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief.' That statement is virtually indistinguishable from the class-warfare demagoguery used by Democrats like Ted Kennedy and John Kerry." – Pat Toomey, The Club For Growth (Pat Toomey, Op-Ed, "The McCain Record," The Wall Street Journal, 3/13/07)

Sen. McCain Joined Democrats In Voting Against The 2001 And 2003 Bush Tax Cuts:
In 2001, Sen. McCain Was One Of Only Two Republicans To Vote Against The $1.35 Trillion Bush Tax Cuts. The bill lowered marginal rates, eliminated the marriage penalty, and doubled the child tax credit. (H.R. 1836, CQ Vote #170: Adopted 58-33: R 46-2; D 12-31; I 0-0, 5/26/01, McCain Voted Nay)
In 2003, Sen. McCain Was One Of Only Three Republicans To Twice Vote Against The $350 Billion Bush Tax Cuts. The comprehensive bill lowered taxes by $350 billion over 11 years – including increasing the child tax credit and eliminated the marriage penalty. (H.R. 2, CQ Vote #179: Passed 51-49: R 48-3; D 3-45; I 0-1, 5/15/03, McCain Voted Nay; H.R. 2, CQ Vote #196: Adopted 50-50: R 48-3; D 2-46; I 0-1, 5/23/03, McCain Voted Nay)

(Rep. Maxine Waters, Op-Ed, "Bush's Tax Cut Is Bad For America," The Los Angeles Sentinel, 5/29/03)

In 2003, Sen. McCain Said The Bush Tax Cut Went "To The Wealthiest Americans." SEN. MCCAIN: "[W]hen you look at the percentage of the tax cuts that, as the previous tax cuts, that go to the wealthiest Americans, you will find that the bulk of it, again, goes to wealthiest Americans. I would like to see some of that redistributed more heavily to middle-income and low-income Americans." (NBC's "Today," 1/7/03)

I'm not giving tax cuts for the rich." (Glenn Kessler, "Outcome Uncertain In Bush Tax Cut's First Test," The Washington Post, 4/3/01)
