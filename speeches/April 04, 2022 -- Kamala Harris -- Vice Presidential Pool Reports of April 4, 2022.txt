Next, VP admired murals in the hallways created by local artists. Principal Trahan said the murals' subjects were selected to be "culturally relevant" to their students.

VP pool report #6
Today's program is now underway in the school hall.
Ahead of VP's remarks, a White House official sends the below on background:
On background from a White House Official:

This afternoon, Vice President Kamala Harris will announce the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure. The Vice President will make the announcement while visiting Thomas Elementary School in Washington, DC with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy.
The Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure pulls together dozens of resources across the federal government, including the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to support school districts across the nation. That includes schools like the one the Vice President will visit this afternoon.
This announcement also builds off the Vice President's work to support clean air and clean water for all communities across the nation, including through the Accelerating Clean Transportation announcement last month and the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan.

VP pool report #7
VP's remarks are underway. A reminder that remarks are being live streamed.
VP told the audience "I love our educators" to applause. She shared an anecdote about her first grade teacher attending her Law School graduation as she praised the impact of educators on her life.
"There are many things that contributed to me being here at this very moment as vice president" she said as she thanked educators.
As she outlined the administration's announcement today on investing in energy upgrades, VP said repairs and upgrades to schools' heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are important for students to be able to concentrate and to perform year round.
She gave the example of a school in St Paul, Minnesota, which she was told had to pass out wet towels and water bottles in the days before summer break because classroom temperatures were pushing 100 degrees. She said a dozen students had to be sent to the nurse's office.
VP concluded by saying "as we take on the challenges of the future, I'm looking at our students: we need your helpâ€¦. We are counting on you".
VP then greeted a dozen or so students who were stood behind her on stage. Your pooler does not have their ages or any detail on how they were selected.
Event has concluded and pool was swiftly ushered back into the press vans.
