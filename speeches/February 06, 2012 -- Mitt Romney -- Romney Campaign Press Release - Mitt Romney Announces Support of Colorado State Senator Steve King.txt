    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Colorado State Senator Steve King.
"Colorado might be one of the deciding states in defeating President Obama," said Mitt Romney. "With the support of conservative leaders like Senator King, we will bring conservative change to Washington and stop the overspending and overregulating of the Obama Administration."
"Mitt Romney is the one candidate who will be able to fix the mess in Washington," said Senator Steve King. "He is the only candidate with experience in the private sector and actually knows how jobs are created. President Obama has had three years to turn around our economy and he has failed — it is time that we had a leader like Mitt Romney to get Washington out of the way of Colorado job creators. That is why I am supporting him and why so many great leaders in our state are behind his campaign. I urge all Coloradans who want a change in Washington to come out and support Mitt Romney on Tuesday — our country deserves a man like Mitt Romney as President."
Background on Senator Steve King:
