    In response to Donald Trump's visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"What we saw from Donald Trump today in Wisconsin is no different from what we've seen from him all along: self-centered divisiveness accompanied by zero solutions.
"Trump failed once again to meet the moment, refusing to utter the words that Wisconsinites and Americans across the country needed to hear today from the president: a condemnation of violence of all kinds, no matter who commits it.
"Kenosha is in pain, not only from the tragedy of senseless violence, but from the immense and avoidable suffering wrought by the Trump administration's failed and reckless management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic devastation that has followed. We didn't hear a word about a plan to finally control this crisis, which has taken the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across the country and throughout the state of Wisconsin.
"While disappointing to every American, this sad display comes as no surprise. The Trump administration has outright confessed that they see violence as a winning electoral strategy, nevermind the cost to everyday Americans. Trump cannot bring himself to condemn violence that he himself is stoking.
"This is not leadership. As we stand at this critical juncture for our country, Joe Biden is offering a path out of the darkness of Trump's destructive and divisive presidency. Joe Biden knows that this fight for the soul of our nation must break for the side of unity and light, and we must come together to reject the chaos Trump has inflamed."
