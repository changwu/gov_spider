    Last Tuesday many of you felt the real-life trauma caused by a powerful tornado. Many of your homes were damaged or destroyed. We have already begun to help you as you recover from this terrible storm. I have declared that a major disaster exists in portions of Kentucky, and I have directed the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), James Lee Witt, to make sure that Federal assistance is available immediately. FEMA will work with State and local efforts to make sure that help continues with speed and efficiency.
The good people of Kentucky have already begun to help their neighbors recover from this tornado, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to continue to do our part to help rebuild the affected communities.
Our hearts and prayers are with you
