 In town pool report #1 -- good morning 
Good morning from the White House on a truly beautiful fall day in Washington, D.C. I will be your print pooler today. Pool has been tested for COVID-19 in lower press. As usual, no news is good news.
President Trump does not have any public events on his schedule today. He is scheduled to have lunch with Vice President Pence at 12:30pm, which is closed to press. The president has been tweeting this morning. I will let you know of any schedule updates and please feel free to reach out with questions.
