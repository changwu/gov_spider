    "Senator Santorum and Speaker Gingrich, they are the very Republicans who acted like Democrats, and when Republicans act like Democrats, they lose. In Newt Gingrich's case, he had to resign. In Rick Santorum's case, he lost by the biggest margin of any Senate incumbent since 1980. Again, borrowing, spending and earmarking is not a good combination if you're a Republican and not a good combination in my view for America." â€” Mitt Romney
