HENDERSON, Nevadaâ€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul released today a simple yet innovative 'Plan to Restore Nevada' to help Nevada get out from under its unfortunate standing as a leader in joblessness, housing foreclosure, and federal interference.
"Ron Paul is the only candidate with a serious plan to help Nevada with its pressing problems and make it number one in all the right categories, rather than a leader in housing foreclosures and joblessness. It reinforces the idea that Dr. Paul's economic vision for America, based on returning authority to the people and the states, is the right prescription for our economic ills and indeed it can bring about lasting, sustainable prosperity," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
The plan helps Nevada residents, workers, retirees, debtors, home buyers, homeowners including those facing foreclosure, job-creators like the tourism industry, federal land ownership victims, and other stakeholders renew the Silver State's economy and sovereignty after decades of disastrous Washington interference.
The five key elements of the 'Plan to Restore Nevada' include:
1. Restoring Nevada's Job Market
2. Restoring the Housing Market
3. Restoring Tipped-Worker Wages
4. Restoring a Common Sense Visa System
5. Giving Nevada Back To Nevadans
