    South Dakota Senator John Thune today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about redistributing wealth:Â 
"This election presents a very clear choice. On one side is a government-centered society where Washington takes the lead. On the other side is an opportunity society where free people and free enterprise thrive. If we had any doubt about where President Obama stands, that doubt was eliminated when footage surfaced showing then-state Senator Obama expressing his support for redistribution of wealth. That's not the American way. It's not what built this country. It's not what made us great. This is the most important election of our lifetime. And now we know precisely what is at stake."
