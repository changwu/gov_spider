    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following comment in response to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) call on CNBC for the Boeing plant in South Carolina to be unionized.
Senator Santorum said: "Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama are flat out wrong on this issue - and their policy position here is a major reason our economy is struggling. I'm running for President because I understand that this economy can succeed and people can get back to work when the federal government gets out of the way. Simply put, government does not have the right to tell private companies where they can and can't do business. South Carolina, Governor Haley, and Congressman Scott are working with Boeing to bring jobs to their state and they have every right to do so."
