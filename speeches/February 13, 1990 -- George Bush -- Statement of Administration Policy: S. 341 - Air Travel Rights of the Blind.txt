    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Per 2/16 LA meeting not sent)
(Senate)(Hoilings (D) South Carolina and 32 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 341. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering a rule that would allow only passengers able to perform certain functions necessary in emergency evacuations to sit in the exit rows of an aircraft. The rule would apply neutrally to all persons, based solely on their ability to perform these functions. The rule would maximize the likelihood that people sitting in exit rows would be able to perform important safety functions quickly and efficiently.
