    Q: Do you have any confidence Congress can get something real done on guns?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I really hope and pray that they do. And I have a great deal of confidence in people like Chris Murphy. And I know that -- that he is sincerely working at this in a bipartisan way, which is really the only way we're going to be able to get anything done.
You know, I temper my optimism with, you know, knowing that when Sandy Hook happened, nothing happened. But, you know, I -- I do believe that people can learn, and I do believe that people can revisit an issue like this and perhaps have a change of heart and mind. So, I remain optimistic.
So, thank you.
